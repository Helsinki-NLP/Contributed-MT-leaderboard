# MT Model Benchmark Scores

Here are recipes for evaluating MT models and scores coming from contributed testset translations.
Scores will be computed and collected for each model based on the provided translations to make them available for the [OPUS-MT dashboard](https://opus.nlpl.eu/dashboard/).
Each sub-directory may come with makefile recipes to evaluate particular models and testset translations that are published elsewhere.
There are also recipes for handling system outputs that are uploaded via the [OPUS-MT dashboard](https://opus.nlpl.eu/dashboard/).
Generic recipes for evaluation and score registration are implemented in [OPUS-MT-leaderbard-recipes](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/OPUS-MT-leaderboard-recipes)
