Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on top with a light or carotenoid background.
The find also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed barrel, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult and not a chicken.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage, and not plumage.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.
The governor's office says 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police have said they suspect a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant is responsible for the attack.
They have discovered that the Sun worked under the same basic principles as other stars: it has been seen that the activity of all the stars in the system depends on their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate actual observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day, and hotter at night.
Their thermal behavior is not stable like large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep clots in the earth, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper with the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can be witnesses that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the proceedings. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strong supervision, following specific procedures.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a fine line if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service has indicated to journalists that it will not be making any further statements, at least until sentencing.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley dispute.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to accept it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, as the pilot was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership of NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooting Association's Hunting Partnership program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Director with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt operation received proper safety training and coaching.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunctioning and overheating iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating-related incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "frankly unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage has been reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there was no tsunami warning.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and so far at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers were recently released.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady, who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Hospital for Women in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll meet her at the altar...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question because of his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to manage his pain because it's forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered to date on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed from comets that collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology for air traffic controllers to locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
No reinforcement of transport is envisaged and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; at street level there are also no car parks or connecting car parks.
Concern over a lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the game will be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in only two generations, although it was thought that much more time was needed for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a Galapagos cone-billed finch, Geospiza conirostris (outside).
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be beaten or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on top of other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance, and you can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
Lombard cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders, and then with clean, moist hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected by a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewers have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also lavatories. In Roman civilization, lavatories were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered in joint company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most remarkable thing the wheel has done for us has been to make transportation much faster and easier.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope to deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including feral domestic cats) that eat small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave to a large extent like wolf packs, which are animals with behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (though not other large cats) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the force of a forced human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus panther) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of the lion, but rather resembles a shouted phrase of angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals they eat (prey) by scent, smelling the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Octopuses hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then swooping down on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main and original group (for example, crossing a mountain range or a river, or migrating to a new island and cannot return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of what we eat comes from plants, and without plants, most animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it wasn't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than seventy knife-sharp teeth, accompanied by an additional set in the roof of the mouth, so that there was no escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us today, the Romans had some unusual or unusual foods at their banquets - wild boar, peacocks, snails, and small rodents called dormouses.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they soaked together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
So for example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a primary temple that was considered to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to fill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an enclosed sanctuary to which only the priests could access.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Much of a Hebrew family's time was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple open counters facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Now, despite its discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map written on it.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its creation the long scroll (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it looks like the notation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by Vichy France, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also defines in some way the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central governmentCongress being its only componentunder the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
The most well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are those of winter, and have the presence of Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the world's seventh-largest island.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors coined the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it initiated the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and used Chinese laborers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the sensor formats of digital image cameras.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a bit of confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple pattern that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period European history was challenged by the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite differences in language and culture.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist precisely for that reason.
The church had been the ultimate authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the church was fulfilling its dogma.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire segments of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company of New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical eras: each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period that took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods fierce wars took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army on classes, from this point on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcended this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that would become known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a fairly clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if you know it's there, it's not easy to find.
There is nothing to see except a clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of Death contains several pyramids (among which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward-arching" signal resembles the letter V (low V) and the "downward-arching" looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it's up it means you start at the tip and push the bow up, and when it's down it means you start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow down.
Rubbing the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while doing so in reverse produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of writing down your own indications, but keep in mind that the bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Theresa aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and whistling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to carry the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd held up the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, thus covering much of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars you have to understand the context that fostered the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology at the same time has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography appeared that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital went from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height of popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, and due to the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the west with 25 to 30 years of delay.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to button their clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses seeds saved native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of the factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
The feral child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost entirely equal to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little clipboard assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized into the software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they're not nurtured, loved and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of safety for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The shelter is supposed to confer all the needs that were not covered in the home from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the focus of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated public reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these capacities for interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the back and forth variation between the two gene pools in each generation.
On the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant resources to get would have been the proteins that we get from leaves and vegetables, but unless they're cooked, these are difficult for primates like us humans to digest.
On the other hand, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Still, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the way modern savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is the process of waking up during the normal sleep period and going back to sleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a quiet alarm clock that wakes you up but does not completely wake you up.
If you reset your watch while sleeping, try moving it to the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, so that one forces oneself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present, each person has the potential to find peace and fulfillment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but spread by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defenses had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy disposal of milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasture areas, often watched over by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they were pulled by horse-drawn wagons to achieve higher speeds and carry heavier loads on the more difficult sections.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place; however, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, didn't walk upright in the usual way.
Bipedal specializations have been found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old australopithecine fossils, although sahelanthropes may have walked on 2 legs in full stretch as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that might exist in the future.
This only works as a symptomatic treatment in most cases, however, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant life-style of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press located a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap's flyers".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive -- we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur would.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Look for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both redoubts and bed bugs are nest-builders, adapted to see in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents end their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only way, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a private car-based transportation system.
Science shows us today that this huge carbon economy has unleashed one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed lands, you will rarely hear so many complaints about bad water or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these kinds of complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a fairly constant range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This gives them a wide variety of tiny places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the sandfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
There were people who thought what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved toward the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 4,000 miles (6,387 km) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, all of which also, according to his theory, changed to become the new substances that make up what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also other metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
Today, messages are typed on computer screens without ever needing a typewriter.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill, separating the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust measures 70 km thick in the nearest part and 100 km in the farthest part.
It is thinner under lunar maria and thicker under mountainous areas.
It may be that there are more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues: One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "just another guy" (or girl).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, you transform into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in bickering between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet in different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member addresses. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used efficiently across the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the customer's need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus narrowing the research area and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior supports the findings of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into several home computer applications and video games.
Themed field trips are an important part of any classroom. Often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips where students can see artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, each year the site is updated, but older versions are kept online as a souvenir book.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this often changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, blogging begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be more astute with the world around them". The need to fuel audience interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what others are writing about and also highlight their own perspectives on particular topics by responding actively to Internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all of these things, and more, that make Ontario stand out to outsiders as a quintessentially Canadian city.
The population of the great northern expanses is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make an often surprising population comparison, there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a major path to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say she is married, regardless of true marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (one that does not look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be stalked, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans and Beninese used it as a strategic port, which bore the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina we can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be wise to investigate before making any visit outside this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" special for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each assisting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entrance fee must be paid.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main hub.
The cluster of buildings that make up Hong Kong's urban skyline has been related to a bright bar graph that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of Kowloon Promenade.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists occupied, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps -- they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/marshy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axolotls in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Panakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River between the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not accessible until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), with an established value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
Outlying islands are unlikely to accept credit cards, although they may accept British and American currency; check with landlords in advance to determine which method of payment is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you have to do it when you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) are common in the summer months.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the sensation colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less invariable throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, ants, bears and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't leave enough distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the death of paramount leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Beaches are plentiful, as Auckland straddles two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes full family beaches with a good range of shops along the coast.
The most well-known local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
You can drink a lot of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines don't travel well.
It's perfectly safe to drink local tap water, but if you're scared, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of cutting is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes well loaded with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The melted chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year there are many trips to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, he follows the advice of the authorities, obeys all traffic signs, and pays close attention to safety warnings.
Cubozoans are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any requests or suggestions should first be sent to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp right there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to get there early to get a place to camp near the music.
Please note that even if the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected areas.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include a time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically strive to maximize the time and money spent by their patrons.
They usually have special foods, drinks and entertainment offerings to cheer up the guests and keep them from leaving the establishment.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Driving in high latitudes or between mountains should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to trap you in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow falling or being displaced by wind, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without much disruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the overland journey to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs and leopards are occasionally shy, which is why you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "rural walking", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend into July 2020, when the Olympics were due to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical entry for around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. In many hotels you can ask for an iron and an ironing board, even if there are none in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you may want to consider using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others it takes several minutes.
Effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and if you have concerns you should consider buying water from a reputable brand in sealed bottles.
The traveler may encounter pests of animals with which they are unfamiliar in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from duties and taxes in certain places.
Travelers bound for heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, passing frequently through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware of sharp inclines, narrow passages, and tight turns.
The posted speed limits are notably lower than those of other front and rear sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, cell service is stronger here than on many other segments of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good and Bavarian pastry is very, very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Fruit pastas are common, with apples baked inside the pastas all year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also carry almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits.
If you want small but flavorful pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is in common use.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find all over the archipelago and offers a wide variety of dishes seasoned in a simple way.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but can present safety problems because the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a rider jumps from the horse but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.
To begin with, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a single thin and fairly thin toe.
In addition, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the hide of the stirrup to fall off the saddle if a rider pulls it back while falling.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also called the Yosemite of South America, has many large granite walls and cliffs.
There are breathtaking views from the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through its endless expanse of walls.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a surfboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", planning entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old -- there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, but it was not until 1861 that Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski tourism or ski touring.
It is related to, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter run on rough terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking - although you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a beige backpack on flat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling between different countries would involve a lot of visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
While you are in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured items that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.

A course will normally cover all of the issues discussed here in greater detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.

Pre-operative transsexuals should not be expected to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns after waves collide with the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Because of the topology of the water, the return flow is concentrated at a few deeper stations, and a strong current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
You might want to head somewhere where you won't be captured again or, depending on your skills or if you've been briefed, you might want to wait for a ransom.
Return shock comes earlier than culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among them are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains here merge to form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 220-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4,892 m (16,000 ft) Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without phone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as one must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is commonly used on boats, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.

While any yacht can pass the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sport boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is equally quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises make an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city using a couple of full days returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark with excursions on board, you do not need an independent visa (dated 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the city tour is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have not flown before or have suffered a traumatic experience.

For some, a basic understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Courier companies charge well for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important for business documents, merchandise or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the stuff by air, there are routes where unloading and clearing customs can take days.
The only way to ship it faster was as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger to carry it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
Now, this is not cheap: you can usually expect to pay up to four times the price of economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!

Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or places of education.
Because light pollution at the time was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
