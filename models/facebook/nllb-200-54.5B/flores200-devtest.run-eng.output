Scientists describe the animal's fur as brownish above and pale yellow below.

The design of the tail feathers seems to indicate that they were used, not for flight, but for insulation or display.
Although the tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers say, the markings revealed adult feathers, not juvenile feathers.

Israel demands that troops remain in place for ten years when an agreement is signed if the Palestinians agree to allow them to stay for only five years.
Archers participating in another germ warfare experiment must be adequately supervised by park rangers as the experiment has been audited and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been employed in the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS Wildlife Sanctuary, the four shooters selected for the first-shot program received adequate safety training and instruction.
Martelly installed a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month the leadership council ordered the dismantling of the existing CEP in order to adopt measures that would lead the country to new elections.
The group was Martelly's response to the anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were provoked by the failure to organize elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 damaged iPods were reported to have overheated, causing at least six fires and four casualties.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan reports that 27 accidents involving the devices have been reported.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 incidents of overheating, which the company described as "minor".
The ministry responded by calling the filing of Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported no damage in the country.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported no signs of an imminent tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Maniye, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the passengers with his M16 rifle.
Many of the hostages were rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six of the abductees, including children and the elderly, were quickly released, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then posed as an elderly woman who was going to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered medicine.
She attended residency training at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying pre-natal obstetrics during her leave.
His studies indicated that the injection could accelerate the formation of lung tissue in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday removed two boîte noire recorders from Wednesday.
Other fighters from the fight remembered Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna is the first high-class queen. She's my first assistant. Luna died two months ago. She was the only good one.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as tough as me...even tougher...I love her and I'm going to miss her...I hope she was in a better place".
Of 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 election, those against Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard confirmed in a 2010 broadcast that she believed Australia would become a republic following the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agreed, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to reign in Australia.
In a more detailed poll, 29% of respondents thought Australia would soon become a republic, while another 31% thought Australia would never become a republic.
The gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100 metres and the 200 metres freestyle as well as three Commonwealth Games events, but her complaints raised questions about her fitness.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because he was banned from the sport.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the greatest common divisor of integers on January 25.
Several people tested the invention using mathematical tools and artificial intelligence in early February, it was announced on Tuesday.
Meteorites may have been the source of earth's water and life - supporting proteins.
Researchers hope to understand the formation of planets, especially our earth, from the debris of ancient collisions.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
Based on rumors, "it will be difficult and politically stupid".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a technology developed by the FAA, which allows aircraft to fly shorter routes while saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Satellite technology is being used to bypass older ground-based radar systems to help air traffic control provide better visibility and accurate information to air traffic controllers.
No transport links have been added and the SkyLines do not extend to Wembley, with seats not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation have added to suggestions that football could be played behind closed doors without spectators to support the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the discovery of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported a new species that has evolved in only two generations, though the process took much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into almost any shape.
It can be made into a very fine fiber that can be grown, crushed, or made into paper.
It can be made so small that it was sometimes used to decorate illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a toxic substance, and you can see it in the red fluid.
A red solution changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the nutrient it contains.
The pH level is indicated by the level of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test substance.
Hydrogen ions and their protons and neutrons are removed (while hydrogen atoms combine with protons and neutrons).
Using clean, cool hands, gently whisk together two pieces of dry dough, and then knead them into a ball.
Your palm touches the surface of the flour, causing the dough to rise and form a bowllike consistency.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro featured mud huts in almost every building, linked by an ingenious system of cisterns.
Remains of septic tanks have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also bathhouses in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, a bathhouse was a type of public bathhouse where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone a thousand feet away, you are using a satellite.
A spacecraft receives a signal and sends it back, almost simultaneously.
Researchers use space mirrors because the earth's atmosphere bends some light and reflects it back into space.
It takes a very large rocket more than 100 feet in length to launch a spacecraft or telescope.
The bicycle has changed the world in remarkable ways, not the least of which is its ability to simplify and speed up the movement of people and goods.
He gave us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Next come medium - sized marsupials that feed on animals ranging from insects to lizards.
Finally, there are the many small monkeys (including monkey frogs) that feed on such tiny creatures as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The dominant instinct is individuality, a special function that keeps each mammal species from competing with others.
Lions are the most gregarious of the big cats, often living in large groups.
Groups consist of one to three mated pairs of adult males and up to thirty females and their cubs.
Females are often closely related by blood, forming a large family with brothers and sisters and their female offspring.
Wolves and dogs are remarkably similar in temperament to lions (but different from other primates), and they kill their prey without fail.
The leopard is a very athletic animal, able to climb (though not much), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The leopard belongs to the same genus (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, the leopardess, and the jaguar.
A leopard's roar is not as powerful as a lion's, but it is more like a roaring, piercing cry.
Ocelots prefer to eat small insects, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when possible.
Scientists believe that the proboscis monkey uses its sense of smell (olfaction) to track prey.
The ocelot's night vision and keen eyesight enable it to hunt by burrowing into the ground and leaping onto prey.
When a subpopulation (a few organisms) becomes separated from its parent population (such as by moving across mountains or rivers, or by moving to another island and finding it difficult to return), it often finds itself in a different environment.
In this new environment, with different environments and different organisms, the new organisms need new or improved parts to compete more effectively than was previously possible.
The original organism remained virtually unchanged and needed no further physical changes.
So as the new group adjusts to its new environment, it begins to look different.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call it speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and one of the most important steps in evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb carbon dioxide (which we exhale).
The sun enables plants to make their own food through photosynthesis and provides shade.
Plants are used for shelter, clothing, and most of our food. Without plants, animals would die.
The mosasaur was the most powerful animal of its day, so it had nothing to fear except its companions.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as serrations on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other crustaceans.
It threw everything it could into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not outrun it.
Although many of the foods eaten at Roman festivals were similar to ours, a number were unusual or exotic - peacocks, peacocks, partridges, and locusts.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women sat on couches at the table, the rich men often feasted together, reclining at the table.
The diet of the ancient Romans may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not grow corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans did not practice tribute.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built elaborate temples, which they viewed as sacred.
The people made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the deities by holding festivals.
Each temple had a common courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Some of these temples had pyramidlike towers called ziggurats.
At the top of the tower is a shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a home was not of great importance.
The Hebrew family spent much of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard. Shops were just open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
Since forests were scarce in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was driven from Iceland for murder, traveled west, landed in Greenland and disappeared.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already there.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all called Scandinavian countries, their peoples, rulers, customs, and histories differ in many ways.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There is writing on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Declaration of Independence First Printed July 4, 1776", which appear toward the bottom of the document, in raised capital letters.
No one is sure who wrote the document, but it is known that the large parchment in which it was written (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was originally rolled up in a scroll.
Hence, those words may simply have been written to describe the letter.
The north of France had been liberated by the landing of troops and the outbreak of war, but the south was still under enemy control.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made a pact with Germany in 1940 to work with the enemy rather than against it.
On August 15, 1940, a coalition of pro-French forces invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces, having liberated southern France, began advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a set of values shared by a large group of people who live and work together - a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning people, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town.
The survival of civilization requires that knowledge be passed on from generation to generation, that values be preserved, and that they be properly disseminated.
Small cultures often disappear with hardly a trace of their memories, so they cannot really be called a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states initially formed a federal government based on the Articles of Confederation.
Since there was no national government or judiciary, the Council depended on officials in the various states to enforce any laws it passed, which they often failed to do.
It had no authority to interfere with the taxation and monetary laws of the various states.
Laws had to be approved by all the states before they could be passed, and the states despised the federal government so much that delegates were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, handball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up Japan, it is often called the "eight-island country".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when Europeans sailed through and claimed the beautiful Ilha Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the southwest coast of Taiwan, transforming the local grain industry and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coastal provinces of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a Qing territory in 1885.
In 1895, after the Qing government was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled until 1945.
The site of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the surrounding buildings have been restored so that visitors can see what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu site had been restored, and work continues.
For example, most of the world's photographic film stock is 35 mm wide, which was the standard film stock at the end of the motion picture era.
These photographs are still being processed, and more importantly, their images are being used by the light sensors in modern cameras.
Actually, and somewhat surprisingly, 35 mm films are 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratios (whole numbers divided by twelve) are said to be 3:2.
Many common measures (called APS, for example) are the same or nearly the same.
The widely used and often criticized rule of thirds is a simple way to make an image sharp and balanced.
This rule states that the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image into three adjacent cells (see illustration).
At that time in European history, the Catholic Church, already wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united Europe despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
Its far-reaching influence affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One Christian principle is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that congregation funds exist primarily for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the highest authority in the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being observed.
At the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed naval sanctions on Germany.
This strategy worked because it deprived their soldiers and civilians of basic necessities, even though the sanctions violated widely accepted international law written down in a series of treaties signed centuries earlier.
Britain set traps in international waters to deny access to large areas of ocean, threatening noncombatants.
With little publicity, Germany hoped to do the same with its excessive anti-submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, many nations and peoples preferred to avoid war and concentrate on their own affairs.
Because the nations had experienced the horrors and suffering associated with World War I, most wanted to avoid a repeat of it.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique system of dating, with each era or dynasty being associated with a particular dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times there were bitter struggles between many rulers vying for power.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in a struggle for supremacy at the great imperial court at Xi'an.
These revolutions led to social and political changes, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the nation belongs to all its citizens rather than to a single ruler.
After the French Revolution, all males were given equal access to positions of responsibility, allowing those with determination and courage to succeed.
Similarly, military ranks could now be won on the basis of valor rather than birth.
The French Revolution inspired revolts among oppressed peasants in other countries.
Muhammad was a deeply spiritual thinker who used to meditate in the cave that came to be called "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (Light).
The cave still exists, and its appearance clearly indicates that Muhammad enjoyed meditating on God.
Located on a hilltop to the north of Mecca, the cave is isolated and inaccessible.
Normally, a cave is hard to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside, you have no idea what is outside.
You see nothing but the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains, and from your vantage point in the cave, you see and hear little of the world outside.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the surviving Seven Wonders of the World.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramids built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the colossal Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "top of the bow" resembles a V, and the "bottom of the bow" resembles a paper clip with no bottom edge.
Upper indicates that the bowstring is pointed forward, while lower indicates that the bowstring is pointed downward.
Frequent blowing of the horns produces a soft sound, while pulling produces a loud, powerful sound.
Feel free to make your own marks with a stylus, but remember that bow markings usually have musical significance and should be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Queen Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In the procession, they crossed back into Paris surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob ordered the King and Queen to entertain their entourage.
On one occasion, one of the attackers grabbed the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenses of the American colonial government in the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to pay for much of this, and interest on government funds was deposited in Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Indeed, the enormous benefits derived from the long - term enslavement of the Filipino people have been the basis of U.S. foreign policy interests.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the reasons for their existence.
The period of these events is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to have ended in the 1500s.
Biotechnology is a very broad term indeed, ranging from the idea that science produces new materials or that we must accept science, to even the idea that man's future depends on certain basic concepts related to the laws of science, which are then applied to the design of technological devices.
Most definitions of the term biotechnology agree on two general ideas: that technological progress itself moves in a way that goes far beyond cultural and political concerns, and that technology in turn affects "impacts" on human society, rather than social outcomes.
To illustrate, one might say that the automobile makes improvements to roads necessary.
However, a network of country roads is not economically viable when the number of cars is very small, so alternative designs are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Increased car ownership is also having a major impact on traffic accidents, leading to new medical techniques for treating injuries.
Romanticism had a large moral component, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, the landscape shaped the people, with local customs and traditions emerging over time, and these, in harmony with the social environment, were preferable to the coercive laws of nature.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe under the feudal system.
Its fame as a precious trading center lasted from about 400 C.E. to about 1100 C.E.
It began to lose its importance in the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders returned with a cargo of spices and condiments worth far less than those found on the Byzantine market.
At the same time, the name of the fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was largely influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
Even so, because of the attraction of communication routes, the western system could be 25 or 30 years behind.
At the end of the Money Age, western Europe began to develop their own system. One of the developments during this time came as a result of the crusades when people started using prisons to bind clothes.
Modest farming is farming that produces just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple, often uncomplicated system of using locally stored grain and using crop rotation or similar natural techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Minority cultures bring together like-minded people who feel socially excluded and help them to feel a sense of belonging.
Cultural minority groups can be diverse in terms of age, ethnicity, gender, location and/or gender.
Signs of such a distinct cultural minority group may be language, religion, gender, location, or a combination of factors.
Members of a minority culture often express their identity through a variety of gestures, including distinctive clothing, behavior, and language.
One popular way to illustrate the value of a good marriage is to look at some unfortunate examples of children who, through neglect, lack of opportunity, or deliberate abuse, did not learn how to get along with adults when they were growing up.
Some illegitimate children have been abandoned by people (usually their parents); in some instances this abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Pregnant children may have suffered serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in forests themselves.
When raised closely with nonhuman animals, the offspring of carnivores display (physical) traits that are almost identical to those of the animal that raised them, such as fear or aversion to humans.
While goal - oriented learning is supposed to make learning easier and more enjoyable, helping students reach a higher level is.
While goal - oriented learning is supposed to make learning easier and more enjoyable, helping students reach a higher level is.
Assistance to students may be non-existent or available, in other words, the teacher is for example a tool, such as the spreadsheet in Microsoft Office.
Invisible aids are embedded in the computer program and are designed to query, trigger, or explain steps that would otherwise be too difficult for the student to perform.
Children are placed in institutional care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to threats.
No child should ever have to grow up without proper care, attention, or discipline, but they do.
We see the childcare system as a safe place for these children.
Our childcare system is expected to provide a safe environment, loving caregivers, appropriate discipline, and good health care.
The day-care center is expected to provide them with any missing documents from the homes they were evicted from.
Information technology is used for both mass and peer-to-peer communication.
The unique characteristics of digital technology open up new avenues of scientific inquiry into how people consume and benefit from media.
For example, "studying" and "talking to others" are given as the main motivations for using ICT (James et al., 1995).
"Having personal space" and "having lasting relationships" have also been suggested as new themes by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their investigations of how people respond to social media.
The use of photography has led us to discover a profound sadness in the fleetingness of words, the fleetingness of faces.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting what is rarely said.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still discern what is honest.
Rather, he suggests that this ability to perceive human behavior may also exist in domestic animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two distinct classes of nature: latent and manifest.
Evolution adds a new trait, and selection removes it from the set of available traits.
Isolation and integration allow for a back-and-forth transition between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, a monkey with a digestive system similar to that of humans would hardly get enough nutrients from the available plants.
And beyond that, failure to reproduce has serious negative consequences: development of depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
A common plant food would be the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult for a body like ours to digest unless cooked.
By comparison, animal foods (beans, lentils, eggs) are not only easy for the body to digest but also provide proteins that contain all the necessary minerals.
All things considered, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved their "genetic problem" in much the same way as monkeys do on the savannah today.
Arousal is a planned awakening from normal sleep and a return to sleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using an alarm clock that beeps softly to simulate waking up without waking you up.
If you find yourself changing the alarm while you are asleep, you may want to move it to the other side of the room so that you will have to get up to turn it off.
Other circadian rhythms require heavy drinking (especially water or tea, known as urinary diversion) before bedtime, causing you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of a person's peace of mind is inversely related to the degree of his physical and emotional turmoil.
The fewer the disturbances, the greater the vitality of the present life, and the greater the individual's potential for undisturbed peace and happiness.
The only thing standing in the way of fulfilling this desire is our own confusion and lack of discernment.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has been influenced by the Mahayana way of love and by many of the techniques of Indian Yoga.
The law of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, equanimity and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and images.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation practice is the Yoga Sutra. Through visualizations of various sutras, the energy manifests, the chakras open, and enlightenment occurs.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a collaboration between Russia and the United States. By the end of the war the breakdown of institutions, practices and culture had led to the destruction of both countries.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and see actual combat, with proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish army had been defeated, and all that remained was to reorganize for an invasion of Romania.
However, those plans were thwarted when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers crossed the border between Belarus and Ukraine after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, a Soviet-Polish nonaggression pact, and other international agreements.
Cargo shipping is the most efficient means of transporting people and large quantities of goods by sea.
A ship's job is to check your country's ability to transport people and goods and that of your enemy.
A good example of this was in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II, where the United States ferried troops and supplies across the Atlantic in support of Britain.
Meanwhile, Germany was also trying to stem the tide of submarine warfare.
If Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union had failed, Germany would have conquered Britain as she had the rest of Europe.
The first goats were probably domesticated some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Since ancient times, people have raised them for their milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Usually, the goats were put in another herd and left to graze on the green hillsides, often with the help of children - a practice that continues to this day.
England built carriages in the 16th century.
Although the chariot tracks consisted only of planks laid side by side, the horses pulling them were faster and could carry heavier loads than ordinary roads.
Chariot tracks were originally constructed to support them, but it was only later that they were reinforced with steel.
This became very popular, but the invention soon led to other uses of chariot wheels.
Later, iron wheels replaced the wooden ones, and in 1767 the first train rolled off the line.
The earliest known transport was walking. Humans began walking upright more than two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
The earliest humans, Australopithecus, did not stand erect.
Bipedalism appeared in Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make peace with the environment, or we can join environmentalists in reducing the damage caused by environmental neglect.
If we want to prevent a recurrence, we should identify the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of advances in science and technology, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and poor living conditions.
After passing the House on July 4, the bill, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap for publication.
In one night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The bill was first read publicly by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops on July 9, and it reached the British capital on August 10.
Only copies in 25 Dunlap broadsides survive; the originals are no longer in existence.
Many paleontologists believe that some species of dinosaurs - what we would now call birds - may still exist.
Most people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many features of birds that are also shared by dinosaurs.
They have legs but they're ravenous, they lay eggs and they're bipedal like T-Rex.
All modern computers are based on the use of binary information.
This system can have only one digit, 0 or 1, and these digits are known as binary digits, or bits.
Symptoms, such as numbness, often appear so frequently that it is not necessary to look for them.
The first sign of poisoning may be the appearance of an open bottle of medicine or a bottle of other household remedy.
See the accompanying leaflet for the first - time use of this product.
Entomologists commonly use the word "insect" to describe this group.
The word is derived from the common cochineal, an insect well adapted to life on the human body.
Both lice and pubic lice are brood parasites, living in nests or in the home of an animal or a human.
Throughout the United States, an estimated 400,000 people have multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the number one chronic disease among youths and adults.
MS mainly affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop the condition.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests to have a child.
The couple may choose to adopt the child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish all authority over the child to the adoptive parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand the workings of the natural world through scientific methods.
Not only that, research is one of the methods used to find answers to one or more questions and then provide ideas that help in other research.
Humanists drew heavily from ancient writings, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were widely accepted in science and the humanities.
As Greek knowledge declined, Western countries found themselves less interested in Greek science and humanities.
Their behavior, both physical and behavioral, appears to be influenced by their daily routine and reproductive cycle.
The evolution of animals, especially in the fossil record, has been influenced by many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological forces are like an electric current that continues to flow even in the absence of external signals.
The work of Hershey and Chase was one of the first steps toward proving that DNA is a synthetic cell.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to inject their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted, one with phosphorus-containing DNA and the other with sulfur-containing protein.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, including whether the genetic material is altered or whether the cells taken are mature cells that give rise to the mutant organism.
However, mutations in a person's stem cells can affect future generations, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause death or cancer.
Ecotourism is a popular tourist attraction that involves visiting natural landscapes with diverse flora and fauna.
Recreation may include hunting, fishing, photographing birds, exploring wildlife, and learning about biology.
Examples include hiking, photography, and learning about Borneo's glaciers.
Every morning, people in small towns drive to work in big cities and meet others who have jobs in their hometowns.
In this drive, everyone lined up and supported unconventional car-based transportation.
Science now suggests that this carbon store disrupted the origin of life and had a hand in human existence two million years ago.
Everyone has a role in society, and everyone uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed lands, you rarely hear of people complaining about water or broken bridges.
Why do people complain about transportation every day?Where does it end?Are transportation officials and people incompetent?Or is there something else we don't know?
A study that combines the study of how drivers move with that of how normal vehicles move and interact with one another is called traffic studies.
However, studying traffic is not easy because you cannot predict exactly how a driver will behave.
However, drivers tend to behave well; this makes traffic easier and can be studied mathematically.
To illustrate the flow, three main factors are related: (1) frequency, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This association assists in the planning, design, and construction of roads.
Small insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to evade predators as well as to find food and partners more easily.
Many insects have the ability to camouflage their plumage.
This gives them plenty of opportunity to hide from their enemies.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the dragonfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the moon revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is correct but others think differently; that the moon revolves around the earth, including the sun (and possibly the stars).
This seems logical, since we do not feel the rotation of the earth, do we?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest and largest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, at times up to six miles [6 km] wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The mighty Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects the waters of thousands of other rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and engineering.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses the Italian language for its laws and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most civil servants while Latin is commonly used in religious services.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have long known about the chemistry of such elements as gold, silver, and copper because they can be obtained from natural sources and are readily available with the use of common tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These were similar to the four possible states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and vapor, although they have been reported to evolve into new forms that we observe.
Remember that there are a lot of things on the board that say what metals are on earth.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can also find alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter is made up of other matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is so small that billions of them could fit into the space before you finish this word.
Thus, the wooden pencil became very popular when it first appeared.
Sadly, with the introduction of new writing methods, the wooden pencil lost its value and was replaced by less cumbersome materials.
Nowadays, people text on their laptops rather than on a keyboard.
One can only wonder what the brain will be like when it encounters something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle that there must be forces that hold the nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
In other words, you are pulling the chariot up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to separate spontaneously or slowly.
The lunar surface is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer is called the crust.
Crete is about 45 miles [70 km] wide at its narrowest point and 60 miles [100 km] wide at its widest.
It extends from the lowlands to the foothills of the mountains.
There may be more grooves on the near side because the croute is narrower, making it easier for the croup to move upward.
Psychic readings rely heavily on what people prefer and follow.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/or desires that are innate and grow as they mature.
These theories look at what makes some people want to do things and what environmental factors will make them do or not do certain things.
The best known are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor model.
In general, there are two types of behaviors that can occur when managers begin to dominate their former colleagues.
This type of leader has trouble making unpopular decisions, imposing punishments, evaluating performance, assigning tasks to individuals, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the line, a person becomes confused and blames himself for the actions of all the workers.
After all, it is the manager's job to promote or demote employees.
This attitude often leads to conflict and alienation between superiors and other employees.
Telecommuters are treated the same as office workers in terms of what they are expected to do, but with a slight difference.
Telecommuters often work as liaisons with office workers.
They tend to have more independence than office workers because colleagues can meet even if they are not at the same time and may not be recognized by management.
The existence of "invisible workers" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a feature of knowledge workers.
The "invisible group" is the governing body, overseeing the activities of all the group's members.
Why does a desirable organization take the time to arrange for training? One purpose of training is to develop thinking ability.
When all available tools are used effectively in all aspects of organizational life, innovative thinking and creativity can flourish.
So when members of an organization work together to overcome an obstacle, new ways of serving customers can be devised.
As an organization innovates, those taking the lead must instill in its members a spirit of innovation, shared knowledge, and wisdom.
The book Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum technique is used to help organizations perform at a high level.
Some neurobiological data provide physical evidence that a purely theoretical approach to learning is possible, thus limiting the scope of research and making it more informative.
The link between behavior and neurological disorders supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage - such as injuries, trauma, and tumors - change a person's behavior and alter certain aspects of mental function.
New technologies make it possible to see and study brain structures and functions that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and knowledge that we can use to develop brain-imaging technology that can help us understand the workings of our mind.
Although AI is most often associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of neuroscience that deals with the behavior, learning, and adaptability of intelligent machines.
AI research involves teaching machines to autonomously perform tasks that require intelligence.
For example, assessment, planning, and site preparation, the ability to solve customer problems and issues, understanding handwriting, facial expressions, and voice.
These have become various communities seeking solutions to life's problems.
AI is now commonly used in finance, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been incorporated into a number of home computers and video games.
Often the teacher will want to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Modern technology makes it possible by means of virtual tours, in which students can see exhibits in a museum, tour an aquarium, and view a magnificent painting in a classroom.
Virtual field trips also provide excellent opportunities to reflect on the trip and to share experiences with other students.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a Web page about their trip to the state capitol. The page is updated annually, but the old page is kept up to date.
Although students often start out on such sites with poor grammar and spelling, frequenting these sites often helps them to improve.
Since the majority of comments are made by students, the author of the site carefully avoids detection by tweaking what he says.
Blogging "forces students to become more curious about the world around them". They become more intelligent and interesting because they want to please their visitors (Toto, 2004).
Blogging allows students to collaborate and encourages them to seek knowledge outside of the classroom.
Effective use of blogs "can make them more observant and less gullible; by commenting on what they see on the Internet, students can indicate where they stand on what others have written and on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's well-organized capital city, where two major languages are spoken and several art galleries present Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the lesser-known natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more makes the province of Ontario uniquely Canadian to outsiders.
Vast areas in the far north are sparsely populated and, in some places, virtually deserted.
Here is a surprising statistic: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is more or less the size of a continent, with its own laws of nature.
Almost all the smaller islands are either independent countries or associated with France, and they have a reputation for producing expensive diamonds.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, where it became dominant in Comoros and Mayotte.
Gradual European contact began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama charted the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahara Desert to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Wives: It is required that all female travelers identify themselves as married, regardless of their present legal status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but the man gives one that looks very expensive.
Women should know that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as abuse and it is not unusual to be followed, taunted, and so on.
Be firm in getting rid of men, and don't be afraid to protect yourself (Different cultures or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century B.C.E. and was later used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenids as the port of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by merchants from Spain who laid the foundations for trade.
Casablanca is one of the wrong places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan items, such as tajines, ceramics, tiles, pots, and various geegaws, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a major tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by volcanic eruptions from Mount Nyiragongo that flooded the streets of the city, especially in the center.
Although Goma is generally relatively safe, before traveling outside of Goma, it is wise to do some research to learn about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
It is also the gateway to the Nyiragongo volcano and offers the opportunity to see mountain gorillas at the cheapest price in Africa.
You can use a motorbike taxi to get around Goma. The usual price (there) is about 500 kyekongo to the nearest.
Combined with its winding streets, "Tombouctou" came to be used as a metaphor for worlds away.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its beauty attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the deterioration of the desert sand.
It was one of the main subjects during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) stretches from northeastern South Africa along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers an area of approximately 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each containing different ecosystems.
It is one of the major tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As is the practice in all South African National Parks, there is a maintenance fee and an entrance fee on all designated park days.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also be helpful, which grants access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a destination for many tourists.
The skyline of Hong Kong has been depicted by a series of bright lines in the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and drive to the opposite side of Kowloon.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island consists of ash removed from the north shore.
And a British colonial site is always a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of the site.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) across Bangladesh and India beyond the country's borders.
The Sundarbans has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest on the Indian mainland is designated as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves - they are some of the last remnants of the dense forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which one third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a Special Protection Area, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 leopards found in the region.
Buses run on the regional road (across the river), all day, most of them eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since school buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Many neighborhoods have Japanese-style minibuses, which are comfortable and relaxing.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers reach 83 metres (272 ft) in height, 378 metres (1,228 ft) in length and have two lanes of 3.50 metres (11.5 ft) width.
The bridge was completed in August 2011 and was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to open to the public in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are an indigenous group of what is now eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunter-gatherers engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous peoples such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who depend on hunting, gathering wild fruits, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Indian Territory", was born from the encounter of Spanish colonists with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
From its beginnings in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its identity and cultural identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.

For those new to competitions and purchasing tickets for polo matches, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The currency used in the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at a bank on one of the islands in Stanley opposite the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds will normally be accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
In the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. dollars may be accepted; check with the local authorities for acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is always hot during the summer and cold during the winter.
Montevideo is located below the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively pleasant: The temperature rarely drops below freezing, but cold air mixes with it to create a feeling of coolness far below the thermometer.
There is no single "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of precipitation is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are familiar to humans, they are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
Bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack you, even if they seem to be calm.
These animals are large, ferocious, and dangerous, so keep at least a safe distance.
Be aware that odors attract bears and other animals, so avoid walking or preparing food that smells strong, and keep your tent clean.

Reserving a room ahead of time gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he or she will have a place to stay.
Travel agencies often contract with hotels, but sometimes you can book alternative accommodations through a travel agent, such as a camping trip.
Travel agents often arrange for tea, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotels.
They may even have reserved a seat for you if you need time to think about it or to obtain additional travel documents (such as a visa).
But changes or requests should be made through the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
For some events, the vast majority of concertgoers prefer to stay at the venue, and many consider it important to do so.

Often there are no windows or wall clocks, and exit doors are hard to find.
Special food, drinks, and entertainment are often provided to keep the visitors happy, to make them want to stay.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and no conscientious gambler can ignore the need to keep his wits about him.
The prospect of driving through deep snow, ice, or bitter cold should not be ignored.
On icy or snowy roads, however, you cannot drive as well as you can on gravel because the tires do not grip the ground as well.
During a snowstorm, icy conditions can suddenly make travel impossible.
When snow or wind chills the air or freezes car windows, it is also difficult to see inside.
On the other hand, in many lands, ice or snow is the norm, and travel is rarely interrupted year-round.
Wildlife tours may be the first thing that attracts and entertains many visitors to Africa.
The word safari is often used to describe low-level trips to see Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially in the rain forest.

Be careful not to let clothing get too hot (as this can cause frostbite or even burns).
There are various methods of treating water, some of which present specific risks.
In some cases, one minute of boiling is sufficient; in others, several minutes may be required.
Sanitation is not the same as quality, but a cautious person would consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter insects that are unfamiliar to them.
Insects can spoil food, making it unpalatable, or they can cause serious illness, spreading toxins or germs.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can inflict serious injury or death are usually excluded.

Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway to navigate.
If you are not used to driving on English roads, beware: there are many potholes, narrow lanes, and tight turns.
The speed limit is lower than in the front and rear sections, generally 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/ h).
Surprisingly, though, the phone reception is better there than in many other places along the highway, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
Bavarian boats, like those of neighboring Austria to the south, are rich and varied.
Fruit boxes are common: Apples are packed in boxes year-round, and cherries and berries are produced in summer.
German pastries include almond paste, noisettes, and others, and the most popular pastries are served with hot coffee.
If you want small but filling pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.

Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "soupy".
In the central southern states of India and Pakistan, butter is commonly used in curry soup. In southern India and some other coastal states of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Since Indonesia is made up of some 17,000 islands, its cuisine includes a huge variety of regional specialities.
But unless otherwise noted, it usually refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which has become popular throughout the islands, includes a variety of dishes with typical spices, such as noodles, chili peppers, sugar (especially coconut sugar), and other spices.
The stirrups are devices that the rider inserts into the horse's right and left stirrups.
The bridles prevent the rider from stepping, but they can be dangerous because his feet sometimes get caught in them.
If a rider falls and gets his foot caught in the stirrups, the horse may pull him along with it if he tries to run.
First, many riders wear special shoes that have a smooth heel and toe box.
Next, saddles, especially British saddles, have safety devices that prevent the footrope from slipping off the saddle if the rider pulls backward in a fall.

Cross-country skiing dates back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Backpacking in ski boots: Also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or walking in ski boots.
This does not usually include ski de randonnée or the related alpine ski-mountaineering, which tend to be done on steeper terrain and require the use of stronger ski boots.
A ski trail has been compared to a hiking trail.
In good weather, you may be able to walk farther than a walker, but you will rarely be able to match the unencumbered speed of cross-country skiers on slippery trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many sovereign states, and travel to most of them normally requires a visa and passport control.
When it comes to such travel, the Schengen area makes these countries more like one country.
While you are in the area, you can usually cross the border without having your passport checked.
In addition, having a Schengen visa eliminates the need to obtain a visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a very old invention. Some tax agencies classify items more than 100 years old as very old.
In some places, such as North America, the age requirement may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called old-fashioned and are superior to mass-produced factory-made counterparts.
Reindeer husbandry is a major occupation among the Sami, and the culture associated with this trade is also important to many people in other professions.
Even in their own culture, however, not all Sámi gave much thought to rearing reindeer. They made a living by fishing, hunting, and the like, using the animals mainly for hauling loads.
Today, many Sámi are involved in modern trades, and hospitality is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sami homeland.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often viewed negatively because of negative stereotypes or misconceptions.
If your destination is classified as a high-risk country, it may affect your travel health insurance and travel cancellation.
It may be helpful to check with authorities in countries other than your own, but their advice is usually directed to their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different problems than Europeans or Arabs.
Governmental warnings provide only a glimpse of the political situation in a country.
The suggestions given are often careful, general, and far more simplified than the detailed information found elsewhere.
Hazardous air is a general term used to describe any airborne condition that has the potential to cause damage to property, serious harm to human health, or death.
Hazardous clouds can be anywhere on earth, and they come in many forms depending on location, geography, and climate.
Strong winds, hail, torrential rain, and wildfires are just some of the characteristics and effects of dangerous weather, as are torrential rains, thunderstorms, floods, and tornadoes.
Heavy and moderate snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are among the dangerous weather phenomena that occur in some regions and seasons.
Travelers are cautioned to be aware of any local weather hazards, as these may affect planned trips.
Anyone contemplating a trip to a country that might be viewed as a war zone should be prepared by experts.
A search on the Internet for 'formation milieu hostile' may bring up the address of an organization in your area.
Usually, those offering such courses teach you all of this in detail, including what they have personally experienced.
Courses usually last from two to five days. Participants are required to play a role and are given extensive first-aid training, sometimes including the use of weapons.
Books and magazines on how to survive in the wilderness are available, but few deal with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for return.
Not all countries will accept passports that do not specify a person's sex (X) or documents with a new name or gender chosen by the person.
Governments around the world enforce these documents differently.
Moreover, searches at security checkpoints have intensified since September 11, 2001.
Prospective transsexuals should not expect to have their privacy and dignity fully respected if they pass through a scanner.
Backwaters are tidal currents that flow back toward the coast, often from reefs or similar formations.
Because of the nature of the seabed, returning water tends to accumulate in a few places at great depths, so there can be swift currents to those depths.
Many drown because of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the surf, swimming back to shore is like swimming normally.
Try to go where you will not be caught, or depending on your skill and the presence of others, you may be able to wait for rescue.
The discomfort of returning to one's homeland is quicker than the discomfort of the new culture and customs (which is pleasant at first but short-lived), lasts longer, and can be very unpleasant.
Immigrants who adjust well to a new culture and customs may find it difficult to return to their homeland.
By the time a person returns to his former country of residence, he has become accustomed to new customs and has lost some of his traditional practices.
When you first arrive in a new country, people are likely to be more patient and understanding toward you because they know that you are still adjusting to a new culture.
People may not expect the same patience and understanding from returning visitors.
The sound and light show on the pyramid is one of the region's most exciting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them quietly before the show starts.

The Sphinx is used as a canvas as well as a narrative device.
Signs are hung on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and have numerous outposts, including sixteen in operation as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, with its natural harbor made famous by the volcanic craters of Deception.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost area of the Peninsula, divided by Bellingshausen Lake.
