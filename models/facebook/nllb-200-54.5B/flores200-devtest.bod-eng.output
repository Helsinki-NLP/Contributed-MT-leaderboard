This discovery has given us new insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because even though the dragonfly's wings didn't evolve a fancy fin called a rachis, it did develop other characteristics of a bird's wing - a fin shape and feathers. Researchers speculate that the rachis may have evolved later than all the other features of a bird's wing.

The study, published on Friday in the journal Science, describes the evolution of a new species of seabird on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species of finch evolved between these two generations, but the lineage is generally considered to be much longer than this because of interbreeding between the native Darwin's finch and the geophysical fortress finch, and the migratory cactus finch and the geophysical rooster finch.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes, and it can be made into very, very small shapes.

For example, the most common motion picture format in the world is 35mm, which was the standard format for film at the time.
This is still a work in progress, but importantly, the aspect ratio is maintained by digital image processing.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing because it's 36mm wide and 24mm wide.
The ratio of the sides of this triangle (divided by twelve to get the ratio of the lengths of the sides) is therefore 3:2.
Many public projects (such as the EPS housing project) are more or less perfectly aligned with this aspect ratio.

In ancient China, there was a specific way of marking the different periods, and the different dynasties that ruled China during each period were specific historical periods.

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe developed its own flags and banners, largely as a result of the extensive production of cloth by the crusaders.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces enough food to feed oneself and one's family.

A desk is not a tool for teaching; it's a tool for helping someone learn something new, like programming a computer or starting a new project.
The chair is both virtual and physical, and in other words, the chair is the teacher's chair, and the little iron guy in Microsoft Office is the teacher's chair.

Human-powered transportation is one of the most efficient ways to move people and goods across oceans.
The navy's traditional role is to serve its country by transporting people and goods at sea, while at the same time preventing the enemy from transporting people and goods.
A very interesting recent example of this is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization during World War II, where the United States worked with the British to move people and goods across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German navy was using U-boats to intercept shipping.
If the merger hadn't succeeded, Germany would have more or less occupied Denmark as well as the rest of Europe.

Wagonways were invented in the Netherlands in the 16th century.
Wagonways consisted mainly of two wooden planks that gave the horses the ability to move quickly and efficiently on the narrow roads of the day.
The first of these dams was designed to hold the rails in place, and it was found that if the rails were supported by iron legs, they would be more efficient.
This has become a common practice, even though the iron has become more prevalent on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 single-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest recorded travel was on foot, and humans have been walking upright since the fall of Homo erectus two million years ago.

Bipedal features have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live our lives in harmony with the environment as much as we can, and we can start to participate in the environment and maybe even do something to minimize suffering in the future.
This is a symptomatic treatment in many cases, but even if we don't look at the immediate solutions, we have to look at the root of the problem and fix it.
The world is changing very rapidly because of human science and therefore technology, and the problem is that it's getting more expensive, because of population growth and because there's too much luxury in human life.
On 4 June, after it had passed through Parliament, the draft manuscript was sent by John Hancock, the President of Parliament, and Charles Thomson, the Home Secretary, to the printer John Dunlop for printing.
In one night, 150 to 200 copies were printed of what is now called "Dunlap's Broadsides".
The document was publicly read by President John Nixon on July 8 in the House chamber.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to the troops in New York on July 9, and one arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's Broadside No. 25, which still exists today, is considered to be the oldest surviving manuscript; the original manuscript is lost.
Many modern paleontologists believe that there was a group of mammals that survived and are still alive today, and we call them birds.

Many people have noticed that the physiological processes and cycles that occur in all living things are directly linked to their biological clock.
Circadian rhythms not only respond to other circadian rhythms, but they're also documented in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and mammals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining clock that keeps time independently even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Webb experiment was one of the first to introduce the idea that DNA was a chemical chain.

Nature-based tourism encourages people to go to their natural habitat and see the plants and animals that are there.

An example is learning about and printing an orangutan village in Borneo and going there.
Every morning, when people leave their villages to catch trains to go to work, some of them pass commuters as they leave their homes.

Traffic flow refers to the movement of the wheels and tires on either side of each wheel and the learning of their interactions with each other.
It's hard to teach a good person to walk because it's hard to predict the exact percentage of speech acts.
At best, sloths pretend to act rationally on a finite scale, and are therefore capable of a finite number of movements that can be represented mathematically.

This makes it easier to use the design and structure of the system.
And the locusts were the first creatures that had wings, for their power of flight was to fly before their enemies, and to be an easy prey for them, and to lie down with their young.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their body.

These days, it's Manny the worm priest and Mephistopheles who can't flap their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus predicted that the solar system's moons orbited the sun.

And the divisions of the host, which were set in array, and their numbers were given, according to their hosts, were twenty thousand and two hundred.
Why should an organization go through a long process of building a center of learning? One of the places where you can stumble on the ethics of learning involves innovation.
If a functional group in an organization uses its resources efficiently, it will stifle innovation and new solutions.
As a result, an organization's ability to work collaboratively to solve problems often leads to new ways of innovating to meet the needs of its customers.
Before a brand can be innovative, a leader must create the culture of innovation, and that requires education and systematic learning.
Angel (2006) defines continuity as a process that helps an organization move up the hierarchy.

Students are great at reading, so they're going to try to write as well as they can so they don't get criticized for writing.
In Benin, journalism "encourages students to pay close attention to the world around them". In order to engage readers, students need to be thoughtful and empathetic (Toto, 2004).
Writing became a tool for collaboration and encouraged students to go beyond the traditional school curriculum.
