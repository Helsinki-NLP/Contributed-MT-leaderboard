Besides proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a widely accepted theory - it allows us to see details not usually seen in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown and its underparts pale or yellowish-red.
The find offers a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed tip, called a plumage, but have other parts of the feather - the plumage and the fuzzy base of the plumage - scientists concluded that the plumage probably evolved later from the rest.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or demonstration.
Scientists speculated that although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage, not the fuzzy plumage of a chick.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technology-free experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper with the name of the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The procedural rules of the French electoral law are rather strictly formulated in the statutes.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that, at the beginning of voting, there are no envelopes in the box and no envelopes are put in it other than those that have been duly counted and put in by eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to oversee every aspect of the process, and at night, the votes are counted by carefully supervised volunteers who follow specific instructions.

The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, has made it clear to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other subjects discussed included the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a guaranteed military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep troops for only five years.
The shooters taking part in the additional pest control experiment were closely monitored by forest rangers, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and NSW, qualified volunteers were recruited under the NSW Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous acting president as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
At times, violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were expected as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
According to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), there were 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
"In response, the department called the delay of the Apple report ""truly regrettable""".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09.19 GMT Friday evening).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later posed as an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that when a certain hormone is administered to a fetus, it speeds up the development of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two of the plane's black boxes from flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as weird as I was ... maybe even weirder ... I love her and miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place now".""
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australian republicanism increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree, preferring that Queen Elizabeth II remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes, 29% of those polled think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to manage his pain because it's banned in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets supplied Earth with water, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed because comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political garbage and nonsense.
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of the older ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of aircraft more accurately and provide more precise information to pilots.
"No additional transport is provided and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and there are no overground car parks or 'park and ride' facilities".
Fearing a lack of transportation, the possibility was raised that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted or braided into a palm, it can be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make your own indicator with the juice from a red skullcap.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H stands for hydrogen in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a funny sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of Minoan cities, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mixed.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts light and vision.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most important change the bicycle has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
That is why we have the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat does that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups, or prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually very closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like packs of wolves and dogs - animals that bear a striking resemblance to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A tiger's roar is not a loud roar like that of a lion but, rather, a series of words shouted in a roar.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when possible.
Scientists believe that the proboscis monkey tracks and locates prey by scent, sniffing out places where it has been.
With their excellent night vision and stealthy movements, the ocelot blends into its surroundings to hunt its prey and then pounces on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often end up in a different environment than before.
In the new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics than before and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from the sun and to provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the top predator of its day and therefore feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
It had over 70 razor-sharp teeth in its long jaws, plus extra teeth in the jaws, meaning that nothing that crossed its path survived.
We don't know for sure, but Mosasaurus may have had a forked tongue, and its diet may have included turtles, large fish, other Mosasaurs, and it may even have been a man-eater.
He also attacked anyone who got in the water, even a giant dinosaur, like T-Rex was no match for him.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, deer, and a rodent called the bat.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men preferred banquets where they ate reclining.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no Romans ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built elaborate temples that they viewed as the dwelling place of a god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests attended to the needs of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked outside; shops were simply open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776"". The text is at the bottom of the document, reversed".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early years, a large parchment document measuring 29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the note was simply added as a label.
D-Day and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what came to be called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and liberated French troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning "citizen", which is related to the Latin words civis, "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city or town-state", and it also defines to some extent the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of states.Civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and adequate cultural care.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, of which Congress was the only part.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the often uncooperative powers of the states to enact all legislation.
Nor did he have the authority to nullify tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the federal government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, alongside the German national football team, the most successful team in the world and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians compete in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in a geographical sense because of its archipelago.
Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures - the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common photographic film format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions were inherited from the dimensions of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore assumed to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. a group of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
Often abused and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of regularity in an image.
According to this, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the fundamental beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are earmarked for that very purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the center of ecclesiastical power had been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money raised questions in the minds of many about whether this principle was being observed.
Shortly after the war began, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, as enshrined in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole areas of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with no particular response, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, many citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his last employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each period of Chinese history or each ruling family had a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce fighting took place between the many nobles vying for the throne.
The period known as the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in a struggle for supremacy at the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a monarch.
Even after the Revolution, the fields were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military, because instead of the military ranks being based on class, they were now based on military merit.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a keen interest in the deeper things of the secular world, and he would often go to meditate in a cave on Mount Noor ("Light"), which became known as Hira.
The cave, which has stood the test of time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all once you're told it exists.
There's nothing to see but a clear, beautiful sky and numerous surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is heard or seen inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many giant pyramid structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol 'stern up' shall be similar to the letter 'V' and the symbol 'stern down' to a buckle or square missing its lower edge.
"""Up"" means you should start at the end and push the hook, and ""down"" means you should start at the hook frog (the place where your hand holds the hook) and pull the hook".
The upstroke produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to make your own markings, but remember that the printed strokes are there for musical reasons and should therefore be respected.
Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children - 11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles - and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of angry women in Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved to the startled queen the head of the royal guard slain at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to pay for expenses and interest on bonds that passed through Wall Street banking institutions on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits made from the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines were the elemental profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you have to understand the context that motivated their creation.
The period during which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages and was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the last of which is conventionally dated to 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from a technological drive or technological imperative to a firm belief that human destiny is governed by logic related to the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself has effects on society that are intrinsic rather than socially determined.
For example, it can be said that the existence of motor vehicles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in health care.
An important part of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices more valuable than those offered in Byzantine markets.
During this time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments during this period, prompted by the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming which produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, often semi-natural, system that uses seeds from that ecological region, crop rotation, or other relatively simple methods such as organic farming to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel that societal standards do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a mixture of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the more common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to those few unfortunate cases in which adults failed to socialize children during their upbringing because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called feral or feral. Humans (often their parents) have kept feral children; in some cases, the parents abandoned the child because of a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
When a child is raised entirely by an animal, the feral child behaves (within physical limits) almost exactly like the animal that raised it, such as being afraid of or indifferent to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the educational scaffolding approach goes a step further.
The 'scaffolding' method is not a learning method, but rather a way of supporting people who are acquiring a new learning experience, such as using a new computer programme or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, it can be both a teacher and a little Microsoft Office paper clip guy.
Virtual steps will be integrated into the software to challenge, reference and explain procedures that may be too complex for the learner to handle alone.
Children are taken into care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing and caring and nurturing, but it happens.
We feel that the foster care system provides a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable medical care.
Stepfamilies should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specificities of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are highlighted as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' as new motivational aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of facial movements, or microexpressions, that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately detect sincerity.
He even suggested that animals, such as domesticated dogs, have the ability to interpret human behavior in this way.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the collection of variations it has expressed.
In the case of segregation and recombination, in each generation, the diversity fluctuates back and forth between the two pools.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to ours finds it difficult to obtain amino acids from available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would have been the proteins in leafy vegetables, but primates like us can easily digest them only if cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide an abundance of proteins containing all the necessary amino acids.
Given all this, we shouldn't be surprised that our own ancestors solved their light problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking during a normal sleep period and returning to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This is easy if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up but does not completely rouse you.
If you find that you turn off your alarm while sleeping, you can place it across the room, thus forcing you to get out of bed to press it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea with a known diuretic) before bed to force yourself to wake up to urinate.
On the contrary, the amount of peace a person feels inside is directly related to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force is, and each person can find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana with the path of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, involving kundalini yoga, meditation and a journey of universal love.
By means of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened in Kundalini yoga.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities, through which the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years, and authorized armies would actually fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgeheads.
Those plans were dashed almost overnight, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded and set up fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after conquering eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of navies has been to ensure that a nation can move people and goods while at the same time impeding the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes adopted them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often herded by goatherds who were children or teenagers, similar to the better-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to haul greater loads than on the more rugged roads of the day.
Railroad ties were introduced early on to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails were more efficient with iron rails on top.
This became the standard method, but the iron consumed more than the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking - Homo erectus started walking upright two million years ago.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Examples of bipedal specialization are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can become more environmentally friendly, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
Often it is just like treating the symptoms, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and mankind's lavish life-style.
After Congress passed it on July 4, the draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap copies.
The document's first public reading was given by John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap copies are the oldest surviving copies of the Declaration.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds have several other features that look like dinosaurs.
They have armoured feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or, when used in a computer thread, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to warrant an immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested poison may be an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals nearby.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists officially use the term bugs for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are extremely well adapted to living as parasites on humans.
Both bed bugs and aphids are rodents, adapted for life in a nest or in a host's home.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to raise the child.
These couples may choose to give up their child for adoption.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The fundamental goal of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works. In fact, this method is the basis for most scientific research.
However, scientific research is guided not only by experimentation - an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses - but also by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioural rhythms that can be observed often depend on endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
The existence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic factors, has been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating system that continues to cycle freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence suggesting that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage either with radioactive phosphorus or with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring; mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the scenery as well as the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns to go to work, passing others whose jobs are in the area they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everything is somehow connected to and supports the private vehicle-based transport system.
Science has now shown that this huge carbon-producing economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has been favorable to human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everybody participates in society and everybody uses transportation systems.
In the developed world, you rarely hear this level of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate complaints about daily failures? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be somewhat reasonably consistent and can be represented mathematically in broad terms.
In order to better describe traffic flows, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links contribute to the planning, design and operation of overhead contact line facilities.
Insects were the first animals to move through the air, and their ability to fly made it much easier for them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot turn their wings backward are dragonflies and butterflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - that the solar system with the sun (and even other stars) moved around the earth.
That makes sense, because you don't feel the Earth move, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's second longest and largest river, carrying eight times as much water as the world's second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times up to six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 3,980 miles [6,387 km] long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous country.
The Vatican uses Italian for legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they occur naturally and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter was composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma - although he also speculated that they formed the new substances we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil, when it first came out, was a good friend to many people.
The pencil's importance and use have diminished as newer writing methods have unfortunately emerged.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a sharpener.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, re-fissioning the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a little bump or spontaneously.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometres thick at the front and 100 kilometres thick at the back.
It's thinner under the tropics and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Achievement needs theories try to understand what makes people tick and what they like.
According to these theories, humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during maturation.
These theories are about what makes certain people want the things that they do and what environmental factors make those people do or not do certain things.
The two most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start managing their former peers, this can generally lead to two types of behaviour: at one end of the spectrum, managers try to remain 'one of the boys (or girls) '.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, issue reprimands, make evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is the person who is changing beyond recognition, feeling the need to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes friction between the drivers and the rest of the crew.
Virtual teams are subject to the same high standards as regular teams, but there are still some minor differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their immediate real-world team.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is an administrative team to which each member reports.
Why would an enterprise undertake the time-consuming task of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources across all functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge.
As a result, the company's collaboration to overcome the barrier can lead to a new inventive process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management needs to create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the findings of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models to help us better understand what's going on in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves the automation of machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, responding to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
An AI system is now often used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is also built into several home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every class, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places they can't get to by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can sit in a classroom and look at museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to record a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol.
Blogging can also improve students' writing skills, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Also, ""blogging forces students to become more aware of the world around them"." Capturing readers' attention encourages students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can determine where they stand in relation to other people's writing and provide insight into their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating bilingual capital and is home to a wide variety of art galleries and museums that explore Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies Muskoka and beyond, areas of unspoiled natural beauty.
All of this and more makes Ontario uniquely Canadian to outsiders.
Large areas in the far north are quite sparsely populated and at times almost uninhabited wilderness.
In a population comparison that may surprise many, there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and has practically its own fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that female passengers, regardless of their marital status, state that they are married.
It is also a good idea to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, something may be done that they view as harassment, and it is not unusual to be stalked, grabbed, etc.
Say no firmly to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of gadgets, but these are for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated when lava from Nyiragongo volcano buried most of its streets, especially in the center.
If Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be preceded by research to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the base for treks to Nyiragongo volcano and the best place in Africa to observe mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Timbuktu is an impoverished city, even though its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "The Wonders of the African World".
Compared with other cities in the country, it is quite different, having an Arabic rather than an African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which gives access to certain South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider a major attraction.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to the shimmering bar charts that appear in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the urban development projects on Hong Kong Island are concentrated on the land along the northern coast.
It's a place that the British colonists claimed for themselves, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of colonial times in the territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just swamps of mangroves - they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the lower Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water or salt marshes.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have also been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 white-tailed deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inland bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakari/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 NIS) and Punakha (200 NIS).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 272 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,250 feet [378 m] long, and it has two lanes each 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The bridge has a crossing height of 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most prominent indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, the encounter between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous peoples gave birth to Paraguay, formerly known as the Province of the Indies.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción's founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character.
It is well known that Argentina's water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here in other seasons.
For tournament news and tickets to polo matches, see the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed at one British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to determine the appropriate method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the nearby tropics, and temperatures of over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild creatures and should not be disturbed.
Park officials say that bears and wolves must be kept at least 100 yards [100 m] away and all other wildlife at least 25 yards [25 m] away!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep their distance, and these are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals, so give them the space they need.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook strong-smelling foods, and keep your camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous 1889 quagmire when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealof III.
Surrounded by two harbors, Auckland has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Denvonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most are shaded by tall mulberry trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay and central Auckland's St Heliers.
These are sometimes overcrowded beaches for family holidays, lined with good shopping.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not complex in taste but pleasant and refreshing.
French wines may be plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, "flat white" coffee is a foreign concept. "Short black" is espresso, while cappuccino is served with a lot of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and it is rare for any of them to cause damage to the reef.
Nevertheless, obey the authorities, follow all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transfers or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They may also hold your reservation if you wish to reconsider the offer or obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
Any changes or requests should first be discussed with the tour operator and not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that while the main stages may no longer play music, there may be other stages at the festival that play until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special campsites designed for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check where your cabin is located because driving through ice creates quite a noise for nearby cabins.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually have no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to find the exits.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep their guests happy and busy.
However, being drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as you can on unpaved asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow falling or flying or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in several countries and traffic continues almost continuously throughout the year.
Perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa is the safari, which for many visitors is the highlight of the trip.
The popular term "safari" refers to overland journeys to explore Africa's wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and can be observed with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and easier to see with binoculars.
'A safari walk (also referred to as a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike lasting from a few hours to several days.'
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 Games, will be the only Asian city to host the Olympics twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation rules do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if it is not in your room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways of treating water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it must be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reliable manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause serious injury or death to humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont introduces some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through often isolated wooded grasslands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful. Steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns are common.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely, though, cell service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the track, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavaria's are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit rolls are traditional, with apples baked into rolls throughout the year and cherries and plums performing in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some hearty pastries, try a pastry called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with either meat or vegetables.
The curry can be dry or liquid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country, allowing you to choose from among the 17,000 islands.
But when used without qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple seasonings, including peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The feet hanging down either side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's legs.
They help the rider to keep his balance better, but they can be dangerous because the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged away by the horse, and precautions should be taken to reduce this risk.
For one thing, most riders wear flat, rather narrow-soled boots with heels.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have guardrails that allow the foot strap to release from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backward.
The Cochamo Valley, a major climbing destination in Chile, is known as the Yosemite of South America.
There are breathtaking views from the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are constantly carving new paths through the endless potential of these rock faces.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one particular location.
Skiing is very old - skiers have been depicted in cave paintings as far back as 5,000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing was practiced as a sport as early as the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to, but does not usually include, alpine skiing or mountaineering. Alpine skiing or mountaineering is usually done on steeply sloping terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than you can on foot, but even on well-maintained trails, you will rarely reach the speed of backpacking cross-country.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries.Travelling through several countries usually means applying for a visa and going through passport control several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area operates somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you will in principle be able to cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
The definition varies in different geographical areas, for example in places such as North America the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of livelihood for many Sami and a trade-related culture is also important for many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Sami farmed reindeer extensively. Rather, they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer primarily as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.
Although the word 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If travel advice applies to the country you are visiting, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel disability insurance.
You may want to consult other governments instead of your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
As one example, Americans may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
National travel advice is simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views expressed are often superficial, generalised and oversimplified when compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world and come in different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are extreme weather events, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any threat of severe weather affecting the region, as this may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for a hostile environment course is likely to return the address of a local business.
