This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional structure that you can't get from fossils.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was brown on top and light or carotene-colored underneath.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a stamen, but have other features, such as rays and spokes, scientists have concluded that the stamen probably evolved later than these other features.
The design of the feathers indicates that they were used, not for flight, but for temperature control or display, and the researchers believe that this is the plumage of an adult, not a chick, even though the tail belonged to a juvenile.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the plumage of the specimen indicates that it is an adult, not a chick.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of a galaxy in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts its influence on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo, made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters cast their ballots in a booth and place a printed ballot with their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.

Candidates are allowed to send representatives to observe each stage of the process, and in the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to established procedures.

This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, with the courts considering that the publication of a photograph can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists enter dangerous territory when they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for the investigation, told reporters that any further comment would be withheld at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state before the Six Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to only five years.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters as the test was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of a partnership between the NSWS and the Australian Shooting Sport Federation (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the Shooting Sport Federation's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, director of conservation and heritage at NPSW Park, believes the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to expedite new elections in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, which have been blocked in some cases since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, describing them as "non-threatening".
When Apple delayed the release of the report, the DOJ called the decision "very unfortunate".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports no damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
A bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Philippine police officer who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued and at least six are presumed dead.
The Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman who needed the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his free time to begin research on preterm labor.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered the black boxes on Wednesday.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, and she died on a night of two moons, which was as special as she was.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe crazier... I love her and will miss her... one can only hope she's better now".
A poll of 1,400 people was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the percentage of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agree and want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the spectrum, 29 percent thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist had been due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints about his form raised doubts about his performance.
The painkillers he needed were forbidden by Olympic rules, so he couldn't take them.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets delivered water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to learn about the formation of planets, especially the formation of the earth, because comets collided with it long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions.
The use of satellite technology in place of older generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
The potential lack of transportation made it more likely that the game would be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species was produced in just two generations, although it was thought that the process took much longer, based on the reproduction of Darwin's finches, blackbirds, cacti, and bryozoans.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes, even the tiniest ones.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, and it can be flattened or rolled into sheets.
It can be spread thinly and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called a chemical pH indicator, and red cabbage juice has the ability to sense pH.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter 'H' for 'pH') contained in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons.
Mix the two dry powders and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in homes in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman times they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The call goes to a satellite in space and then bounces back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts light and thus distorts what we see from the earth.
Launching a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in so many amazing ways, but most of all, it's made transportation much easier and much faster.
Without it, there would be no railways, no automobiles, and no other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits and antelope to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat many more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the niche, the special task that each cat performs, which makes them unable to compete with others.
Lions are among the most sociable of cats and live in large herds.
A pride of lions consists of one, two, or three related adult males and as many as 30 females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related, forming one big family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave like a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
A tiger, a well-built athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, is a member of the genus Panthera.
The roar of a tiger is not as loud as that of a lion but is more like a series of words shouted together.
Ocelots have a taste for small prey, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and they move stealthily, hunting their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island, with no easy exit), it often finds itself in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new traits or adapt in order to compete effectively in this new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and still has to adapt in the same way.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, they become less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different from each other that it will be hard to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to make nutrients, and plants also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we make most of our food from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator at the time, so the only thing it feared were other mosasaurs.
It had more than 70 extremely sharp teeth in its elongated jaws and an extra set protruding from the roof of its mouth, so its victims had no chance of coming into contact with it.
We're not entirely sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and it may have fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, it may even have been a cannibal.
It didn't shy away from attacking its prey in the water, and even a dinosaur as huge as T. rex must have had a healthy respect for it.
Although many foods are familiar to us, the Romans also enjoyed exotic foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and land snails.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on stools, while the rich met for banquets in which they ate in a semireclining position.
Food in ancient Rome could not have contained ingredients that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon each deity had a central temple dedicated to him, which was viewed as his home.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods by the people, and the priests attended to the needs of the deities by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which was the inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located at the top of the tower.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not necessarily a home.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in their backyards, shops were just countertops facing the street, and stones were used to build houses.
Since Canaan had few forests, timber prices were very high.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Without diminishing his role as an explorer, however, it should be noted that Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at that time.
Although each country could be described as "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ from one another in their peoples, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "The Wealth of Nations", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
There is some writing on the back of the document, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words, "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", written at the bottom of the document upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that this large parchment document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was originally inserted for storage.
Therefore, it can be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent fighting led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remained occupied.
The power behind this was the Vichy French, who were the people in France who made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, U.S. and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were marching into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning "citizen", and the related word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state".
City-states were the prototypes of nations, and the culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a fragile central government - with Congress as its only component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments, which were often unwilling to cooperate in enforcing all of its laws.
Moreover, it had no power to repeal laws and tax rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the federal government with such disdain that their representatives often did not attend.
Alongside the German national team, the Italian national football team is ranked second in world football and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italian athletes participate in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands it possesses, Japan is often called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
When the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to change native grain-production practices and to hire Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three basic structures stand out: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
In order to better convey the original appearance of the site to visitors, most of the outlying buildings have been remodeled.
By 1976, one third of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process continues.
For example, in photography the most commonly used format is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, this image format has been carried over into the matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is quite confusing.
The aspect ratio for this format (we divide by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS format group) are identical or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is often abused or ridiculed, but it's a simple guideline to help you achieve a dynamic effect without disrupting the order.
He finds that the ideal place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photograph into three equal parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, the Christian religion provided a vital link between the different languages and cultures of Europe.
Its power was so pervasive that it affected everyone from the king to the peasant.
It is a central tenet of Christianity that wealth should be used to help the suffering and the poor and that church funds should be used for this purpose.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raises the question of whether this doctrine is being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off key military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as enshrined in several international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to block access to vast stretches of ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
This tactic met with limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation for their ruthless underwater warfare operations.
The 1920's were characterized by pacifism and isolationism on the part of most nations and people.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He set foot on American soil with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each stage in China, or each ruling family, was a separate dynasty.
During the interregnums between successive dynasties, the provinces were thrown into turmoil and division.
Many notable claimants to the throne clashed with each other in fierce battles during these periods.
The era of the Three Kingdoms is remembered in ancient Chinese history as a time of great bloodshed; thousands died fighting for supremacy in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not just to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, all male candidates had free access to the professions, so that success could be achieved by those who showed the greatest ambition and agility.
The same goes for the army, because the army ranks that used to be based on class are now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life, and he often went to contemplate in a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (Mountain of Light).
The preserved cave itself gives a very colorful idea of Muhammad's spiritual predilections.
The cave, located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the outside world.
It's not easy to find, even if someone knows it's there.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and you can't see or hear much of the outside world from inside the cave.
The only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also called the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The symbol for "up leash" looks like a "V", and the symbol for "down leash" looks like a clip or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start at the top and pull the string, and down means you start at the fret (where your hand is holding the string) and pull the string.
Strumming from the bottom up produces a softer sound, while strumming from the top down produces a louder, more forceful sound.
Don't be afraid to draw your own symbols, but remember that the symbols printed on the string are there for musical reasons, so stick to them most of the time.
The enraged mob forced a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Élisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
As the king and queen rode back to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by a shouting crowd that showered them with threats.
The enraged mob forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a guard killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the imperialist United States for the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits to be made from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary profits of US imperialism.
The context in which the Order of the Knights Templar was formed is important in understanding its specificity.
These events belong to the period commonly called the Late Middle Ages, which encompassed the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism encompasses a wide range of ideas used in practice, including technological impulse or technological imperative, as well as a strict determination of human destiny guided by a hidden logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism combine two general principles: first, the process of technological development itself is not influenced by cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
Since a nationwide road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is low, new production methods are developed to reduce vehicle operating costs.
Mass car ownership has also led to more traffic accidents and, in turn, to new medical advances to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, they developed customs and culture tied to that geography, so attuned to where they were in society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a place of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until 1000 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because returning crusaders brought goods such as silk and spices that were valued more highly than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
But because the exchange of information was so slow, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is when a farmer produces enough food to feed himself and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses self-sufficiency of seed from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximizing yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures attract people with similar worldviews, people who feel that social norms don't meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within a subculture.
Subcultures are diverse in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination thereof.
If someone is a member of a subculture, they show it through a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most popular ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is based on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during adolescence - whether due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse.
Some of these children have been imprisoned (usually by their parents) and some have been abandoned because the parents were unable to come to terms with their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or escaping, feral children may have suffered trauma or abuse.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are said to live in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is cared for only by animals, it behaves almost entirely (with physical limitations) like those animals, showing fear or indifference to humans.
The project method should make learning easier and more attractive, whereas scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, but rather a support provided to people who are involved in new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real, so the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinach in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised in the software and is designed to question, suggest and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they are.
We believe that the foster care system provides a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and good medical care.
A foster family is supposed to provide for any needs that weren't met in the home they were taken from.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of usage patterns and approaches to gratification.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they studied audience responses to websites.
Video recordings have led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements of facial muscles that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, they say you can tell if a person is lying by accurately reading their microexpressions.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks argues that people who have suffered brain damage and cannot understand speech are still able to judge correctly whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have this ability to interpret human behavior.
Scientific research throughout the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation - one hidden and one expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, whereas selection removes a variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a reciprocal exchange of variation between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
The plants of the savannah make it difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to get the amino acids it needs.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and beans, but for primates like us, they're difficult to digest without cooking first.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digested and provide high levels of protein with all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep paralysis is the deliberate act of waking up during normal sleep and going back to sleep 10 to 60 minutes later.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock, which restores consciousness but doesn't fully awaken you.
If you find that you're resetting your clock while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a diuretic) before bedtime so that you don't have to get up to urinate.
The level of inner calmness is inversely proportional to a person's internal and physical tension.
The less stress you have, the more positive your life force is, and each person has the potential to find total peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, the only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but additionally incorporates the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, a combination of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates an enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allied against a common enemy, Germany, but when the war ended, a radical clash of systems, processes and cultures divided the two countries.
It had been two years since the end of the war when former allies became enemies, giving rise to the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and include real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were quickly abandoned when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of goods and people across oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to keep this country moving people and goods while preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II was one of the most remarkable examples in recent history of an American effort to help the British by ferrying men and equipment across the Atlantic.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to block the flow.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would probably have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Domestication of goats probably occurred in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them for their milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often watched over by goat herders, who were usually children or teenagers.
Railways were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were made only of parallel wooden planks, the horses could move faster and carry heavier loads than on the rough roads of the day.
Railroad ties appeared relatively early, but it was gradually realized that iron rails were needed to make the tracks more efficient.
This became a popular practice, but iron made wooden wagon wheels more wear-resistant.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago and hence the term Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, were not used to walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to do our part to reduce the amount of suffering in the future.
This is often similar to symptomatic treatment, but rather than being a temporary solution, it is important to identify the source of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant life-styles have exacerbated the problems.
When the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops on 9 July in New York.
The 25 extant Dunlap bullae are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of either 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they do not warrant an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Read the package leaflet for first aid instructions for this particular poisoning.
The name worm is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient times, when bedbugs were insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs, like bedbugs, are nest-building insects, adapted to live in a nest or in a host's home.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to raise the child.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption involves the biological parents relinquishing their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The overarching goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which is the basis of most scientific research.
However, this is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows one to reject one or more possible hypotheses.
The classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin, provided the basis for the study of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend fundamentally on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms that are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue through cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant the bacteria with their own DNA.
Two experiments were conducted, one labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, and the other labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on their type, the importance of the genetic material they affect and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including vegetation and wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and gathering information about the ecosystem.
Examples include visiting Borneo, photographing and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns and go to work, passing people on their way to the places they just left.
Within this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone participates in and supports the private vehicle-based transport system in some way.
Today, science indicates that our massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from its steady state that supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar complaints about poor water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they malfunction on a daily basis, and are the engineers responsible for them just busybodies, or is the problem much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It's impossible to predict driver behavior with absolute certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, driver behaviour is generally consistent; therefore, traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between the three key properties, namely (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed, provide a better representation of traffic.
The planning, design and operation of road facilities make use of these relationships.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid predators and find food and mates.
Most insects have the useful ability to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus concluded that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, while others held the opposite view, that the solar system, including the sun and other stars, revolved around the earth.
And that makes sense, because the Earth doesn't look like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the world's second-longest river and the largest, carrying eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at nearly six miles wide in places.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the river water that feeds the world's oceans.
The Amazon in its main course is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never matched the size and engineering of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with awe upon their ancestors' structures, which were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and also the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language of most people working in Italy, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Everyone in the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they occur naturally and can be mined relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was a combination of at least one of the four elements, which were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about their transformation into new substances that shape what we see.
An alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium and potassium are elements that are considered metals, and of course silver and gold are metals.
Alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements, e.g. carbon, may also exist.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly microscopic that the period at the end of this problem would contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil lost its status and frequency of use.
People are now typing messages using computer screens and they don't need paperweights at all.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with lots of protons and neurons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is covered with rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the planet is called the crust.
The mantle is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more areas of maria on the visible side because the crust is thinner here and it was easier for the lava to break through to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people respond to and what appeals to them.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been acquired in the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories refer to what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and not others.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two types of behaviour can occur.
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary action, and shies away from evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable for the work they do.
At the other extreme, you become unrecognizable as someone who feels compelled to change everything the band has done, to make it conform to their vision.
At the end of the day, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often results in friction between leaders and other team members.
For virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact point for a physical group directly linked to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can schedule meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The Invisible Group is a governing body to which all members report, and the Invisible Group sets standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, working together within an organisation to overcome a barrier can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets customer needs.
For an organisation to become innovative, its leadership needs to create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, which narrows the field and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supported by ongoing scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, trauma and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in mental function.
New technologies allow us to see and study previously unknown structures and processes in the brain.
And we're getting a lot of information and a lot of material from that to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include control and planning, the ability to respond to statements and questions from customers, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things became separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and also appear as a built-in feature in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class, and it is not uncommon for a teacher to take her students to places that buses cannot reach.
Technology allows for virtual field trips, so students can see a museum exhibit, visit an aquarium, or admire a work of art from the comfort of their classroom.
By making the field trip available in virtual mode, it can stimulate reflection on the field trip and share experiences with other classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing skills, and often grammar and spelling are not at the highest level when they start blogging, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
The blogger begins to make efforts to improve the quality of his writing and avoid criticism, since students often prefer the strictest grades.
In addition, blogging "makes students more aware of the world around them". The need to respond to the interests of the audience inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, 'students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can take a stand on the work of others and develop their own perspective on issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the pristine beauty of Muskoka County and surrounding areas.
All of these things - and more - clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessential Canada.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them virtually uninhabited wilderness.
This population comparison surprises many people: the number of African-Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, but it is a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allies of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it has become firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European exploration and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should present herself as married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it doesn't look too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they consider harassment, they can often be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Firmly say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't mean you can!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who had trading posts there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is last in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of trinkets, can easily be purchased in the old medina, but these are typically for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge of the country near the border with Rwanda.
The city of Goma was devastated in 2002 when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and buried most of the streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside the city should be pre-screened for the state of the fighting in North Kivu.
From the city, visitors can hike to the top of Nyiragongo volcano and go mountain gorilla hunting, one of the cheapest activities in Africa.
Motorcycle taxis (called boda-boda) can be used to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is about 500 Congolese francs.
In the context of its relatively inaccessible location, Timbuktu became a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the damage caused by the desert sand.
This was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "The Wonders of the African World".
This city is definitely different from the rest of the cities in the country because it has an Arab climate rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, characterised by different flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily security and park entrance fees.
Purchasing a wildlife card can be advantageous, allowing you access to selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory takes its name from Hong Kong Island, which is a major tourist attraction.
The tightly packed rows of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a shimmering bar graph overlooking Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is from Kowloon Wharf across the city.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that was occupied by British colonialists, so it's a good place to start looking for traces of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indian Plateau.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water and wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 leopards.
Buses leave from the inter-regional bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakaru/Bumthang.
It is better to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since buses between districts are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese waterfront buses, comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of transportation to nearby destinations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was opened only in March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be ready for use in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs posts is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of what is now eastern Paraguay, leading semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lives and toiling in agriculture to support themselves.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "Great Province of India", Paraguay was formed in the 16th century as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the polo fields of Las Cañitas host the biggest tournament of the year.
In other months, you can also find smaller tournaments and competitions.
The Asociación Argentina de Polo offers more information about the competition and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, credit cards can be used in Stanley, and U.S. dollars are often accepted.
There is no credit card on the outermost islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; it is best to check with the owners in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] during the summer months.
Winter can be colder than you think: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but when combined with wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer shows.
There is no such thing as a "wet" or "dry" season, and rainfall is virtually the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Although they may look gentle, bison, elk, bears and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance from these large, wild and potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and home to just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
It was here that the infamous naval standoff took place in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the main leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland stretches between two bays, so there are many beaches, but the most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, with safe bathing areas, and most are shaded by metrosideros trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are often crowded, family-friendly beaches with a wide variety of shops lining the waterfront.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
It is good to stock up on a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but if in doubt, bottled water is readily available.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of a flat white - a small black is an espresso, a cappuccino is filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are year-round, and reef-related injuries are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sandpipers occur near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
No one denies the existence of sharks, but attacks on humans are rare, and most of these creatures are frightened by human contact and swim away.
The saltwater crocodiles are not active in the oceans, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler does not have to worry about where he will sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transport from/to the airport as well as combined flight and hotel packages.
Your reservation may be extended if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents needed at your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any corrections or requests should first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, most of them considering it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to find a campsite near the music.
Please note that even after the music performances on the main stages have ended, music will continue to play until late at night in some sections of the festival.
Some festivals offer campsites designed for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the journey through the ice generates terrible noise for those most affected.
For cruise ship passengers, no visa is required (please check conditions).
Casinos usually want their patrons to stay as long as possible and leave as much money as possible, so there are no windows or clocks and it's hard to find your way out.
They usually offer special meals, drinks, and entertainment to keep their guests happy and entertained.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the value of a clear head.
When driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes, conditions such as snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures must be taken into account.
On roads covered with ice and snow, there is little friction, so driving is not as easy as on smooth asphalt.
When a blizzard strikes, snow can quickly accumulate and make a road impassable.
Snow, sleet, hail, or ice on the windshields can also make it difficult to see.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries where traffic moves smoothly throughout the year.
Safari is arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland journeys to view Africa's natural beauty, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment will allow adequate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy, so it is best to use binoculars.
A walking safari can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will start on August 24 and run until September 5, 2012, with some events being hosted in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the date change was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March, most cancellations due to the coronavirus do not include July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that ticket prices for most events will range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they do not have them in their rooms.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
The fabric must not be subjected to excessive heat, as it may shrink or burn in extreme cases.
Water can be treated in a variety of ways, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
Depending on the area, you can boil the water for a minute or you can boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you are concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not native to their area.
Pests damage food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, secrete toxins, and transmit infections.
Pests do not usually include infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers visiting countries with particularly high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, the most challenging stretch for drivers is between Point Marion and Fairmont, often cutting through desolate woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open, as steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those on the preceding and following sections (typically 35-40 mph or 56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to them is of the utmost importance.
Interestingly, though, the cellular signal is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and Bavarian pastries are as nutritious and varied as those in Austria, Bavaria's neighbor to the south.
Fruit cakes are very popular, with boiled apples available year-round and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often go particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want something small but nutritious, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curries, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
Since there are as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
The term usually refers to the cuisine of central and eastern Java, which is the most important island in the region.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes plain spices, and peanuts, chili peppers, and various aromatic spices are among the favorites.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot becoming trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he may be pulled by a runaway horse.
First of all, most jockeys wear riding boots with a high heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety feature that causes the bridle to fall off the saddle if pulled by a rider falling backward.
Cochamó Valley - the most important climbing location in Chile, described as the Yosemite of South America and offering a variety of large granite walls and turns.
There are spectacular views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are still carving new routes through the walls, opening up endless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main outdoor activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski freaks", who plan entire ski holidays in one location.
Skiing has a very long history - as far back as 5,000 B.C.E., cave paintings depict skiers!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski resort.
Ski touring: This activity is also called ski touring, ski touring or ski touring.
Some similarities to alpine skiing and mountaineering can be seen, but unlike them, the route does not require steep terrain and sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under the right conditions, you may be able to cover slightly longer distances than you can on foot, but you will rarely reach running speeds, provided you are not carrying a heavy backpack and your route is well prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to apply for many visas and undergo many passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as a single state.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what human artifacts should be considered antiques, and some tax agencies consider anything more than 100 years old to be an antique.
Depending on geographical location, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be called antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is a way of life for many Sami, and reindeer culture is also important to people in other professions.
In addition to large-scale reindeer herding, the Sami have traditionally engaged in fishing, hunting, etc., using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries, and tourism is an important part of the economy in Sami-inhabited Lapland.
The word 'Gypsy' is commonly heard, especially among people who are not themselves Roma, but it is often considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and misperceptions about Roma.
If the country you are going to is subject to travel regulations, this will affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also check what other governments are advising, but their advice will be for their own citizens.
For example, in the Middle East region, U.S. citizens may be treated differently than Europeans or Arabs.
Counselling sessions are only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
