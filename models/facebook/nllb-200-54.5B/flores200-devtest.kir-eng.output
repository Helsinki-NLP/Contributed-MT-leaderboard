Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides a wealth of information about color and three-dimensional structure that these fossils cannot show.
Researchers have suggested that the animal had a brown coat with a rufous or carotenoid tint.
The find provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur legs did not have a well-developed spine, called the rachis, but had features such as spines and ridges, researchers surmised that the rachis was a later evolutionary development.
It is speculated that the structure of the feathers was not used in flight, but was used to regulate or indicate temperature, and the researchers speculate that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is actually the feather of a larger, non-dinosaur chick.
Although the tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers speculated that the pattern might represent the feathers of a larger creature.

Acting Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's (NPWS) Division of Parks and Heritage Conservation, Mick O'Flynn, said the four hunters selected for the first shooting operation had undergone extensive training and safety training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the newly formed nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly ' s fifth Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years .
The Presidential Commission last month recommended the resignation of the former Chief Electoral Officer as part of a complex set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the mass protests that began in October was the Commission.
There have been some violent protests over the lack of elections since 2011.
Nearly 60 reported cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating have resulted in six fires and four injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) reports that it is aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating of devices, which the company described as "not serious".
The department called Apple's delay "really unfortunate".

While working at the Ligness Clinic, he spent his spare time studying premature births.
His study showed that if the hormone is administered, the fetus' lungs can mature more quickly.
Government investigators on Wednesday completed the decryption of the two black box recorders, reports Xinhua News Agency.
The heroes also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first mentor, and Luna passed away on the night of the two-month anniversary, and that's the unique thing about her. She's a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was just as interesting as I was...maybe more so...I love her and miss her...hope she went to a better place".
In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, a poll of 1,400 people found that those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she hoped Australia would be the last republic ruled by Queen Elizabeth II.
Some 34 percent of those polled agreed that Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Thirty-one percent of those polled thought that Australia should not become a republic, and 29 percent thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but she was nervous and felt unprepared.
Drugs were banned by the Games, so he could not take medicine to relieve his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest prime number on January 25.
In early February, several people confirmed the breach using a variety of hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water, along with the organic material that makes proteins and life possible on earth.
Since it has been so long since comets collided with the earth, scientists hope to understand the formation of the planets, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is expected to run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims can help planes fly shorter routes, reduce carbon emissions, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, which enables air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and give pilots more information.
No cars or trains stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or playgrounds.
Concerns about transportation raised the possibility that the game could be forced behind closed doors, away from tribal fans.
Science magazine reported on a study that Ecuador published on Thursday that revealed a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University, in the United States, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, report that a new species of finch has successfully bred in just two generations - a feat that would have been impossible without the cooperation of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
You can make gold in many shapes, including very small ones.
It can be drawn into thin strands that can be twisted or braided, and it can be beaten or rolled.
Because of its versatility, it was sometimes used to embellish illuminated manuscripts.
This chemical is called hydrogen peroxide, and you can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity and alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level of a test chemical is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH).
And since hydrogen atoms are made up of one electron and one proton, hydrogen ions are these electron-less protons.
Mix the two dry powders, and then squeeze them together with wet, clean hands.
The moisture in your hand reacts with the outer layers to form a funny-looking crust.
At Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, almost every household had a toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in Minoan homes on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese built baths, and Roman baths were public baths where men and women mingled.
You can use a satellite to make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away.
A satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and because the earth's atmosphere distorts the light we see, scientists use telescopes in space.
It would take a rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] long to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has revolutionized the world, and the most important change it has brought about is easier and faster transportation.
It has given us means of transportation, such as trains, cars, etc.
Next come medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Many species of small cats (including house cats) eat small prey, such as ants, rodents, worms, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept, which is a specific task that each cat does that is not in competition with others.
Lions live in large groups called prides and are among the most social of all cats.
Prides consist of one to three mature males and up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females tend to stay close together, forming an extended family of sisters and daughters.
Like packs of wolves or dogs, prides of lions act like lions (but not other big cats) and pose a threat to their prey.
A well-trained tiger can climb (albeit awkwardly), swim, jump, and pull objects up to five times heavier than a human.
Along with lions, tigers, and jaguars, the tiger, a member of the panther family, can sing.
A tiger's roar is more like a series of high-pitched words than the full-throated roar of a lion.
Ocelots eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate their prey by scent and location.
They have excellent night vision and are able to blend into their surroundings to locate and attack their prey.
When a small group of animals (a subpopulation) becomes separated from the main population (for example, by crossing a river or a mountain range, or by migrating to an island and not returning), they join a completely different environment than their main group.
It has different resources and different competitors in this new environment, so it will need different traits and adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed in the past.
The original inhabitants have not changed; they still need to adapt.
As the new nation gradually adjusts to its new environment, it begins to stand out as different.
In time, after thousands or even millions of years, two species may become so different that they could hardly be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, and the appearance of new species is a necessary and inevitable outcome of evolution.
Plants take in carbon dioxide that you exhale and give off oxygen that you breathe.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis, but they also get their shade.
Plants are used for clothing, for shelter, and for food, and no animal can live without them.
The mosasaur was the most feared predator of its time.
With more than 70 razor-sharp teeth in its long jaws and an extra set in the roof of its mouth, it is virtually invulnerable to attack.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and it may have eaten large fish, other mosasaurs, turtles, and possibly its own kind.
It also attacked anything that strayed into the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us today, the Roman wedding feast included strange and exotic delicacies - wild boars, roosters, partridges, and lizards.
Another difference was that the poor man and the woman sat on benches, while the rich man reclined at the table and feasted together.
The ancient Roman diet would not have included any American or Asian food that had come to Europe in the last few hundred years.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa; nor did the ancient Romans eat pork.
The Babylonians believed that each temple was the house of a god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the pope had access.
At times, temples were flanked by towers called ziggurats, which had the unusual shape of a pyramid.
The top of the tower was sacred to a particular deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not of great importance.
Many Jewish families lived outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; shops had simple shelves facing the street; houses were built of stone.
Forests in Canaan were scarce, and timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, Eric the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, traveled west, discovered Greenland, and named it.
Despite this discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each individual country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences in people, rulers, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the treasure map was inspired by the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
The writer of the codex is unknown, but it is known that originally the large parchment (about 11 by 10 inches [29 by 24 cm]) was folded over to hold the document.
Hence, it seems likely that the conjunction was simply added as an indication.
The battles that followed the D-Day landings liberated northern France, but not the south.
It was ruled by the Vichy French who collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them because the Germans and Vichy had signed a peace treaty in 1940.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces were marching into Germany, liberating southern France in two weeks.
A civilization is a cohesive culture or society of people who cooperate and live together.
Civilization is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and is somehow about the size of a society.
The culture of a civilization means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the preservation of cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Smaller cultures often disappear, leaving no historical evidence of their existence and no way to recognize them as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, and Congress was the only component that conformed to the Articles of Confederation.
Lacking the power to tax, Congress had no judiciary or national executive, relying on state governments that rarely cooperated to enforce acts.
It did not have the power to override state tax laws or tariffs.
Amendments had to be approved by all the states, and states often abstained from voting because they ignored the federal government.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, running, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports, in which Italians participate in international and Olympic events, are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan has some 7,000 islands, with Honshu being the largest, making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Japan is called an archipelago because the geographical position of its islands makes it an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up a base in southwestern Taiwan and employed Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the northern and western coasts of Taiwan in 1683, and it was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After Qing rule was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed in 1895, ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings have been reconstructed to give visitors an idea of what the outlying buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, about 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work continues today.
For example, 35 mm has been the most commonly used photographic format, and it was the preferred film size in the late analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, and most importantly the presence of its parts is inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is a little bit confusing because it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (which you can divide by 12 to get a whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Certain formats (such as APS) are equal to or close to the presence of these parties.
The third rule, which is often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline to create dynamism by maintaining order in the picture.
It suggests that the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and thirds horizontally (see example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, with its power and wealth, was beginning to exert a powerful influence.
Although the Christian religion has bound the nations of Europe together for over a thousand years, differences in language and culture still exist.
Its power extended from the king to the common people.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are used for that very purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money made the very existence of this principle questionable.
Once the war began, Britain wanted to break the German naval blockade.
Although this strategy had the beneficial effect of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, the blockade nonetheless violated generally accepted international law, codified in several international treaties of the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters, threatening all shipping, neutral or otherwise.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar attack from her unlimited submarine force.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant national and civic attitudes.
After the atrocities and horrors of World War I, the nations wanted no more.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
When she arrived in the United States, she had with her a collection of poems, a letter of recommendation from her former employer, Charles Batchelor, to Thomas Edison, and four cents.
Ancient China had a unique way of dividing the different periods; each dynasty, or phase of China, was its own dynasty.
Each dynasty also divided up provinces among themselves, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted about 60 years between the Han and Qing empires.
Many nobles fought vicious wars for the throne during this period.
The period of the Three Kingdoms became one of the bloodiest in ancient China, as thousands died fighting for supremacy at the imperial court in Xi'an.
The move from infinity to republicanism, metrication, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler, has many political and social implications.
Moreover, after the Revolution, professions became available to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and enterprising to succeed.
Similarly, in the army, rankings are based on caliber, not rank.
The French Revolution also inspired revolutions by the oppressed working class.
Muhammad was fascinated by the transcendent, and he often went to meditate in the cave of Hira on Mount Noor, which means "Mountain of Light".
Surviving the passage of time, the cave provides a vivid glimpse of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
Located high in the mountains to the north of Mecca, it is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, we know it's there, but it's hard to find, and once you're inside, you're cut off from the outside world.
You can see nothing but the open sky and the surrounding mountains, and you cannot see or hear much of the outside world from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world still in existence.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is the site of pyramids (the oldest of which are also the largest), several small cemeteries, several shrines, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is dedicated to Khufu, and other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are dedicated to Khufu's wives and family.
The "upward-facing character" looks like a V, and the "downward-facing character" looks like a connector or a bottomless rectangle.
The "up" sign means to push from the tip of the arrow, and the "down" sign means to pull from the frog, where you are holding the arrow.
The upper blade produces a softer sound, while the lower blade produces a louder, steadier tone.
You can still draw your marks in pencil, but respect the fact that the curved marks are there for musical reasons.
On October 6, 1789, a distraught King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children - 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles - and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to leave Versailles for Paris by a mob of women.
Surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen, they returned to Paris by carriage.
The king and queen were forced to open wide the windows of their chariot.
On one occasion, a mob desecrated the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
U.S. imperialism's military occupation of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people.
Since they had to pay taxes for the aggressive U.S. policies, most of their profits were covered by interest payments on bonds issued by Wall Street financial institutions on behalf of the Philippines.
Of course, the massive profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were a major victory for American imperialism.
The Knights Templar are best understood in the light of their motivation.
The period of European history known as the High Middle Ages (1000-1300 C.E.) is often described as an eventful time.
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages and then the Late Middle Ages, which ended in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of different ideas in practice, ranging from the drive to produce technologies, or the technological imperative, to the strongly held view that human destiny is determined by the underlying logic of scientific laws and its reflection in technology.
The many explanations of technological determinism can be summarized into two general ideas: that technology develops in a way that is free of cultural or political influence, and that technology is not socially determined, but "affects" the societies in which it is embedded.
For example, we can say that motorization leads to more roads.
Nationwide, the industry cannot pay for itself with a small number of vehicles, so it develops new production methods to reduce the cost of ownership.
More cars lead to more accidents, which in turn leads to more medical research to repair injuries.
Romanticism was heavily influenced by the writings of such cultural figures as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Under Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and eventually the culture and customs associated with geography became better suited to society than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris became the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople became the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It became the center of the jewelry trade about 400 C.E. and remained so until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its status declined, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices, which were valued more highly than in the Byzantine markets.
It was also at this time that the title of the center of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century, Gothic reached its height.
In the early days, Byzantine Oriental culture had a strong influence on clothing.
Even so, because of slow communications, Western styles may be 25 or 30 years behind the times.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people started to bundle up their clothing, which was one of the great achievements of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming where the farmer produces enough food to meet the needs of his family.
Organic farming is an organic system that combines growing and storing seeds in an environmentally friendly area with irrigation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and it is still practiced in many developing lands.
Subcultures provide a sense of identity to like-minded individuals who may feel slighted by social norms.
Subcultures may differ in age, ethnicity, class, gender, and/or location of members.
A subculture is characterized by a combination of linguistic, aesthetic, spiritual, political, sexual, regional, or other characteristics.
Members of a subculture often identify themselves by distinctive and symbolic traits, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways to emphasize the importance of socialization is to refer to several unfortunate cases of children who grew up in difficult circumstances, who were socially isolated by adults, and who faced difficulties or abuse.
Such children are referred to as feral or untrained, and some feral children have been abandoned by other people (often their own parents), sometimes when the parent rejects the child because of a serious mental or physical disability.
Children may have been severely abused or injured before they ran away or were abandoned.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived independently in the wild.
A feral child raised entirely by animals without human contact will display behavior (with physical limitations) that is almost identical to that of the domesticated animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning makes it easier and more fun, but scaffolding can do so much more.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique, but it helps people who are learning something new, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding for teaching can be virtual or physical, so a teacher is a real person teaching, and a little person in the form of a paperclip in Microsoft Office can play the role of the teacher.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, which can be used to explain, ask questions, and recite procedures that the learner cannot do alone.
Neglect, abuse, and even threats are among the reasons children are placed in foster care.
No child should grow up without being cared for, nurtured, and educated, and yet this is happening.
We believe that providing care in the home is right for children.
Our systems of care need to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, consistent education, and reliable health care.
A foster family should be able to provide the child with whatever he or she needs that is not available locally.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The characteristics of the Internet provide additional dimensions of usability and satisfaction.
For example, "reading" and "socializing" are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In 1998, Agee and McCord identified "personal presence" and "persistent relationship" as a new dimension of breathing.
The use of micromovements, which last a few milliseconds, such as video recordings to interpret facial expressions, has led to important breakthroughs.
It is claimed that by deciphering just a few words, a person can detect when others are lying.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks noted that people who have suffered brain damage that impairs their ability to understand speech are nevertheless able to appreciate honesty.
He even speculates that domestic animals, such as dogs, may have the same abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that genetic variation has two aspects: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from known variation.
Segregation and recombination keep the species mixing back and forth with each generation.
Outside the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to ours would have difficulty getting all the amino acids it needs from available plants.
Moreover, failure to meet this requirement can have serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
Protein from leafy plants and legumes is a readily available source, but primates like us cannot easily digest it without cooking.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin, such as ants, termites, and eggs, are less easily digested but provide a large amount of protein, which contains additional essential amino acids.
After all, it is not surprising that our ancestors would have solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the practice of intentionally staying awake during your normal sleep cycle and then going back to sleep after a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
An alarm clock that goes off relatively slowly is a good reminder.
If you turn your alarm off while you are sleeping, set it so that you can get up and turn it off in another room.
Other diet-based options include drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, or certain diuretics, before going to bed and getting up to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has is in contrast with the amount of tension in his mind and body.
The less stress a person has, the more enjoyable the life force is, and the more peace and contentment people can find in their lives.
Everyone has the potential for enlightenment, and the only thing that stands between us and that goal is the negativity and tension that we carry inside.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha and has been expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and numerous practices of Indian yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple -- a combination of meditation, the path of loving-kindness, and Kundalini yoga.
Kundalini, or cleansing energy, can be awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and meditation.
The center of Tibetan meditation is called God Yoga, and visualizing various deities can activate the chakras and clear the energy channels, resulting in a feeling of well-being.
In World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States were united against Germany's war of aggression, and after the war, political, process, and cultural differences led to the separation of the two nations.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had turned against one another in a bloody civil war.
It would last another 40 years, and it would involve actual warfare with loyal armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Cuba, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had collapsed, and their only hope was to retreat and reestablish a foothold in Romania.
Nevertheless, these plans were implemented almost overnight after the eastern territories of Poland were occupied, the Peace of Riga was signed, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, were violated, and over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were mobilized to form the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Cargo ships are the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
Traditionally, the navy's role has been to protect a nation's ability to move people and goods safely - that is, to prevent enemy attacks on people and goods.
And one of the last examples I want to mention is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to support the British.
Meanwhile, the German navy tried to stem the tide with its submarines.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany would occupy Europe and Britain.
Goats may have first been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes domesticated them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Traditionally, domestic goats were kept in herds on hills or in pastures and were tended by boys or young men, known collectively as herders.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn carts consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled horses to pull faster and carry heavier loads all day long than could be done on simple paved roads.
Railway sleepers were introduced early in the railway's history as a means of reinforcing the track, but it was later discovered that they were even more effective when railway tracks were laid across them.
This became popular, but the iron replaced the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Gradually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and from 1767, iron rails were installed.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and it wasn't until about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, that humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
The ability to walk on two legs has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, and Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
If we can begin to care even more about the environment, we can join the environmental movement and to some extent become activists for reducing future suffering.
In most cases, this amounts to symptomatic treatment, but unless we want a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and deal with it.
Clearly, human progress in science and technology has changed the world dramatically, while extravagant life-styles and overpopulation have added to the problems.
Once approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten document was signed by President John Hancock and Secretary of the Congress Charles Thomson and then taken to John Dunlap's printing press five or six blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of the document, now known as the Dunlap broadsides, were made overnight.
It was first read by President John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to the troops in New York City on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving fragments are the oldest copies of the document in existence - no handwritten copy has survived.
And most paleontologists believe that there are one or two families of dinosaurs that survived and are alive today, and they are generally considered to be birds.
Because they have fur and they can fly, people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But many of the dinosaurlike features of birds are still being identified.
They lay eggs, they have scales and claws on their feet, and they walk on their two hind legs like T. rex.
Modern computers are based on information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to in computer jargon as binary digits, or bits.
Because symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common, internal poisoning may not be recognized immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Etymologists use the term "insect" in a more formal sense for insects in this group.
The term comes from the fact that humans have long been familiar with stinging insects called aphids.
Flea beetles and bed bugs have adapted to live in nests or on hosts.
With an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States alone, it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which includes the spinal cord, the optic nerve, and the brain.
Studies show that MS affects twice as many women as men.
Parents may feel that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a child.
They also have the option of adopting children.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The whole point of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method, and the scientific method, in fact, governs most scientific inquiry.
It's not just an experiment, an experiment is a test to rule out one or more hypotheses, to ask questions, or to make observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have attached great importance to classical writings, such as the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on psychology, as well as on all matters of science, were accepted.
As people began to forget the Greek language, the West lost its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in behavior and physiology are due to the availability of endogenous factors and their output through biological time.
Not only do they respond to periodic external stimuli, but periodic rhythms have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-recharging generator that runs automatically in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first suggestions that DNA is the genetic material was the Hershey-Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one in which they labeled the DNA in a bacteriophage as radioactive phosphorus, and the other in which they labeled a bacteriophage protein as radioactive sulfur.
The effect varies according to the type of mutation, the severity of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are in the embryonic line or not.
Mutations elsewhere lead to cell death or malignancy, but only mutations in the cells of the embryonic line are passed on to offspring.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery and wildlife.
Local activities include fishing, hunting, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
Visiting orangutans in Borneo, learning about and photographing them.
Every morning, people in small towns drive to work and pass other commuters who live nearby.
In this mobile transportation shuttle, each individual vehicle is connected in some way to the transportation network and maintains it.
Science has shown that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its most stable states that has helped humanity flourish over the past two million years.
Transportation systems are used by everyone in the community, and almost no one is satisfied with them.
In developed lands, such complaints about poor water quality or broken bridges are rare.
Why do the transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day, are the transportation engineers so incompetent, or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, there is no way to predict with 100 percent certainty what drivers will do on the road.
Fortunately, the drivers are sufficiently stable that traffic flows follow a logical pattern that can be mathematically modeled.
To visualize traffic flows more accurately, three key parameters are related: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid predators and to find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings close to their body.
This provides them with several small areas to hide from predators.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings include dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus predicted that the solar system would revolve around the sun.
While some people thought that he was correct, most believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun and possibly other stars, revolved around the earth.
The earth does not seem to move, so it makes sense, does it not?
The Amazon, the largest and second-longest river on earth, carries eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon River is the world's widest river, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids are unsurpassed for their size and engineering prowess.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired monuments that were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of only about 800, is the smallest independent state in the world and also the least densely populated.
The Vatican's official communications and legislation are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language of the civil service, while Latin is used mainly in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have long been aware of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they all occur in nature in pristine form and are mined with primitive tools.
The idea that all matter is composed of one or some combination of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire - was propounded by the philosopher Aristotle.
This was similar to the four states of matter - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, in that order - but he theorized that matter can go from what we see to what we don't see.
Alloys are made from mixtures of two or more metals, and there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Calcium and potassium are metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When it came out, it was a huge success.
Sadly, modern writing techniques have made the pencil obsolete.
No longer do people have to touch a computer to type a message.
When something newer comes along, who knows what will happen to the keyboard?
An atomic bomb works on the principle that neutrons and protons require energy to fuse with the nucleus.
Some of the energy is released when the nucleus is split again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can split with little friction or for no reason at all.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer is the crust.
On the far side, the crust is about 60 miles [100 km] thick; on the near side, the crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick.
It's thicker under the higher mountains, and it's thinner under the maria.
Because of the shallowness of the surface, there may have been more maria, making it easier for the lava to rise.
Content theories are about finding out what people care about.
These theories imply that people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature.
It's about how certain people are motivated to do what they do and how certain things in their environment lead them to do certain things or not do certain things.
The two most popular content theories are Herzberg's two-factor theory and Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can occur when managers start to exert control over former employees, and trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls) is one end of the spectrum.
Such a ruler has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything his society does to accommodate him.
However, in the end, the leader of the tribe is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the tribe.
This behavior is often caused by a gap between the leader and the rest of the tribe.
The standards of virtual teams are similar to those of physical teams, but there are a few differences.
Members of a virtual group often act as liaisons for their physical group.
They often have more freedom than members of a traditional community because their communities meet at different times, which may not be recognized by the local authorities.
(Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) One component of a virtual tribe is the presence of a physical "invisible tribe".
A secret team is a command that has members who obey, and the team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the painful process of designing a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the organization working together to remove the barrier may lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership needs to create a culture of innovation and opportunities for organizational learning and exchange.
Angel (2006) defines the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations improve productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, narrowing the scope of the study and allowing it to be more precise.
The link between behavior and brain pathology has been demonstrated in scientific studies.
Trauma, injury, and brain tumors are known to affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
Advances in technology have enabled us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that were previously invisible.
The brain's ability to process vast amounts of information and material plays an important role in our ability to create simulation models that help us understand these processes.
Although artificial intelligence has been the subject of much science fiction, it is also an important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent machine adaptation, learning, and behavior.
AI research involves building machines that exhibit intelligent behavior in order to automate tasks.
These include scheduling, scheduling and monitoring, responding to customer inquiries and diagnoses, as well as voice, signature and facial recognition.
And so these things have become disciplines in their own right, designed to deal with the real problems of life.
Artificial intelligence has now been incorporated into a number of home computers and video-game software, and it is being used in fields as diverse as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are an important part of any educational program, and the teacher often wanted to take her students to places that were impossible to reach by bus.
Technology offers virtual field trips so that students can sit in classrooms, visit aquariums, and enjoy art and museum exhibits.
Virtual field trips are a great way to visualize and share experiences with future classmates.
For example, each year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol. The website is updated annually, and older versions are kept online and used as scrapbooks.
Blogs can help students write better. While students usually start a blog with grammar and spelling mistakes, the readers of the blog correct them.
Often, the most critical audience is the student body, and to avoid criticism, the blogger decided to improve the text.
In addition, blogging "helps students to better understand the world around them" and "encourages students to become more intelligent and creative" by increasing their viewership and audience engagement (Toto, 2004).
Blogging can be a tool to encourage collaboration or encourage students to learn outside of the traditional curriculum.
Proper use of blogs "enables students to develop analytical and critical skills; by using material from the Internet, students can establish their own positions from the writings of others, as well as express their personal views on certain issues" (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's attractive bilingual capital, is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, the Muscogee and other untouched wilderness areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario what outsiders may think of as typically Canadian.
Large areas of the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost deserted.
In a comparison that surprised many, there are now more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
In terms of wildlife, Madagascar is the largest continent.

Islam was introduced by the Arabs and spread to the islands of Mayotte and the Comoros.
European influence and colonialism began to be felt in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: When traveling, women are advised to say that they are married, no matter what.
Wearing a wedding ring (not necessarily an expensive one) can also be helpful .
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as pressure, such as following, holding hands, and so on.
(Cultural differences or not, this is not a good thing.)
Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the tenth century B.C.E., and it was used by the Merinids, the Phoenicians, and the Romans as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese rebuilt it and renamed it Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and renamed it Daru-l-Badiya, the name Casablanca given to it by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find shops selling typical Moroccan products, such as crowns, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, destroying many streets in Goma, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is worth exploring further afield to get an idea of the war situation in North Kivu.
It is the cheapest way to trek in Africa's mountain gorilla range, and it is the base for treks to the Nyiragongo Volcano.
Travel around Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle-type taxi). The cost of a short ride (locally) is ~500 Congolese francs.
Because of the difficulty of reaching Timbuktu, it has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
Today, Timbuktu is a thriving tourist attraction, although it still suffers from poverty.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of its location in a desert.
This was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' RBS special "The Wonders of the African World".
The city has a distinct Arabian rather than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordered by the Crocodile River in the south, Zimbabwe in the north, and Mozambique in the east.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles [19 500 sq km] and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most scenic areas and the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).

It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a major tourist attraction.
Hong Kong's parade of skyscrapers is contrasted with the shimmering skyline of Victoria Harbour.
Visit Kowloon Beach, located on the outskirts of Hong Kong, and enjoy the view.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the land that was occupied by the British colonizers, and if you're looking for evidence of colonization of the territory in the past, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching some 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the islands of Bangladesh and the interior of India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and a section of the forest in India has been designated a national park.
In addition to the mangroves, the forest also contains some of the last remnants of the old-growth forest that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, and the area now has an estimated 30,000 crowned cranes and 400 Royal Bengal tigers.
From the inter-regional bus station (on the other side of the river), buses run from early morning to late evening, although most, especially those on the east and Jakarta/Bumtang routes, run from 06:30 to 07:30.
Buses between the districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy tickets two or three days in advance.
Many areas are served by Japan's small, reliable, and comfortable cabotage buses.
Public taxis provide quick and easy access to nearby places such as Paro (150 baht) and Punakha (200 baht).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River, connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to the town of Saint-Georges-de-Luapoque, French Guiana.

Construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge remained closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, although the Brazilian customs posts have already been completed.
A prominent group of Indians in what is now Paraguay were the Guarani, semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced agriculture.
The Chaco was inhabited by indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payagua, who made a living by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", Paraguay was born in the 16th century as a result of a conflict between Spanish conquistadores and native tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained its distinct identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo players and teams in the world.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (KFP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, under the FIC West department store.
British pounds can be used almost everywhere on the islands, and the Stanley credit card and U.S. dollars are widely accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted and only British or U.S. currency may be accepted; check in advance to see which payment methods are available.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before leaving.
Montevideo lies south of the equator, so when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter there, and when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where summer temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters are unpredictable, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but the combination of humidity and wind makes them feel even colder than the thermometer.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons; rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be handled or disturbed.
The park recommends keeping at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] away from all other wildlife.
Bison, buffalo, bears, and other large animals may appear docile, but they can be vicious.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep a safe distance from these large, wild, and dangerous animals.
Also, avoid carrying or cooking food that smells bad, and keep campsites clean because odors attract bears and other wildlife.

But what's interesting is that there's much better cell phone coverage here than, for example, on most of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
Bavaria, like neighboring Austria to the south, produces a wide variety of pastries.
Fruit-based breads are popular, including apple-based breads year-round, and plum and apricot breads in the summer.
Many Germans add almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts to their baked goods.
Depending on the region, try a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krappen if you prefer a smaller, more substantial cake.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables added.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be either "liquid" or "dry".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, curry is often flavored with spices, while in southern India and parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
Indonesian cuisine, with its selection of 17,000 islands, is a popular term encompassing a wide variety of regional dishes made by the people.
However, when used by a layman, the term may refer to foods originating in the central and eastern parts of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago and consists of simple spices such as groundnuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and spices.
The bridles support the rider's legs, which swing from side to side of the saddle.
The rider is offered stability, but there is concern for his safety because of the possibility of his legs becoming entangled.
If a rider falls off his horse and gets his foot caught in the bridle, the horse may continue to drag him.
First, most riders wear shoes with smooth, relatively narrow soles and high heels.
Additionally, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety devices that keep the rider from falling when the saddle is pulled back.

Downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered slopes on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important sport for tourists, and many of the enthusiasts among them are known as "ski bums", who spend their entire vacation skiing in a particular area.
Skiing has a long history - cave paintings show skiers as early as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing is a sport that dates back to at least the 17th century, and Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This sport is also known as skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to alpine ski touring, or ski mountaineering, but is actually a different sport that involves climbing steep mountains with sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under ideal conditions, you may be able to cover considerably longer distances than you can on foot, but it is unlikely that you will reach the same speed on paved roads as you would on skis.
Europe is a relatively small continent made up of many sovereign states, and under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would require numerous passport and visa controls.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area functions as one country in this respect.
If you are in the area, you can cross the border without going through passport control.
If you already have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa again, which saves you time and money and reduces paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax authorities define an antique as a manufactured item more than 100 years old.
There are geographical variations of this definition, where the annual limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted items are younger than similar mass-produced items and may be considered antiques.
In the past, reindeer herding was an important part of Sami life, and trade was an important part of the culture.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami herded reindeer. Instead, they made a living by fishing, hunting, and so forth, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
The word "Gypsy" is often used by non-Roma, but because of negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma, it is often considered derogatory.
If travel advice applies to your destination country, it may affect your travel cancellation insurance or travel medical insurance.
You can get advice from other governments, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
As an example, Americans in the Middle East may experience a different set of circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is a summary of the political situation in the country.
The views offered are simplistic, general, and superficial compared with the vast amount of information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that causes damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather occurs in many parts of the world and can vary greatly according to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones, as well as strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires, are extreme forms and effects of weather.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather events include winter storms, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travel plans can be affected by extreme weather and the threat of flooding in their area, so tourists should check the weather forecast.
Before traveling to a war-torn country, people must undergo specialized training.
The address of a local business may have been included in a Web search for "hostile environment courses".

After September 11, 2001, searches became a nuisance.
Transgender patients undergoing surgery should not expect privacy and confidentiality when undergoing a CT scan.
Rip currents are currents that are usually caused by waves hitting a reef or similar object near the shore.
Because of the underwater topology, the reverse current can collect in deeper sections, where it can create a fast current to the deep water.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue while swimming upstream.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is easier.
Swim to a safe area and wait for help until you are rescued or noticed.
The re-entry shock is earlier (fewer honeymoon phases), lasts longer, and is likely to be more severe than culture shock.

Finland is a wonderful place for sailing. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", it also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
There is no need to sail on lakes and archipelagos.
While large lakes and offshore archipelagos are large enough to accommodate any yacht, smaller boats almost anywhere have a different feel.
In Finland, rowing is a national pastime, and the boat sails with seven or eight people.
You can compare this with countries like Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, which of course are very different in many ways (in the Netherlands, for example, it is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Sea cruises feature an extended layover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can return to the ship at night, stay on board, and visit the historic city for two full days.

If you pay a lot of money for the perks (or, better yet, have your airline pay for them), you can fly first class or business class.
It won't be cheap, though: When you think about it, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times as much for first class as for standard economy!
Generally speaking, on a direct flight from point A to point B, there is no need to look for discounts when buying seats, whether in business class or first class.
Airlines recognize that there are basic groups of passengers who are willing to pay more for a fast and comfortable ride, and they charge accordingly.
