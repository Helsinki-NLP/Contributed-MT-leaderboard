This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already popular, but shows details that fossils usually cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a pale or a carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other functions for feathers - hooks and shells - the researchers assumed that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development such as the other relevant functions.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a dinosaur, the sample showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chicken.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects gravity on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects Sagittarius with its forces.
The researchers came to the conclusion that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is around the galaxy in a kind of glory, and is made of many small particles.

Dr Tony Moll overcame extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality".

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth alone, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate's choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of the judicial process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those carefully counted and from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. During the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers following specific procedures and under strict control.

Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh's court charged with the murder of his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitnesses may have been affected since her image has been much in the public eye.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, so that courts consider the publication of images as potentially damaging to the victim.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be hanging by a thread if they publish pictures etc. of suspects".
Journalists have been informed by the Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, that no further comments will be made before indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the land border units, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders as they were before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The future situation of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley, was among the topics raised.
Israel demands constant military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian state agrees to let this force remain for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control were carefully monitored by forest rangers, which led to the trial being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new electoral council (CEP) of 9 members yesterday.
It's actually Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission recommended last month the dismissal of the former CEP (Haiti's electoral commission) as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was a response from Martelly to widespread demonstrations against the regime, which began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations occurred due to the lack of elections, some of which have been in decline since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (METI) said that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the facilities.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino former police officer has held tourists in Hong Kong captive by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Eventually, photographers took the seat of an elderly woman when she needed the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a medical career.
He trained as a obstetrician and in 1959 began work at Auckland National Women's Hospital.
Liggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would speed up the development of the baby's lung.
Xinhua reported that government investigators retrieved two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as sweet as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed in the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent in the poll share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim both 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three stages during the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have led to doubts about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, because they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, it was reported Tuesday.
Comets were perhaps the cause of water on Earth, as well as ecological matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially with respect to the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will make it possible to fly shorter routes and annually save a lot of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology that allows air traffic control to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in, trains over the hill will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and short-term facilities are inaccessible on the hill.
The possibility of being forced to conduct the game behind closed doors without the team's supporters was raised due to fear of lack of transportation.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species had evolved in only two generations, although many had thought this process would take much longer due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the Mediterranean starling, and the cactus starling.
Gold can come in all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It could be made very thin and attach itself to other metals, and it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical pH, and you can create an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is marked by how many hydrogenions (H in pH) are present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogenions are protons without electrons (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and this feels weird and creates a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a water closet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of cloak systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient times, toilets were also found in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together.
Every time you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
It takes a gigantic rocket at over 100 British feet to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in wonderful ways. The best thing the wheel has given us is a much easier and faster means of transportation.
It's given us many forms of transportation like the train, the car and more.
Below them, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are several small cats (including loose cats) that eat the far more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special job each cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and they live together in larger groups called alliances.
The alliances consist of 1-3 adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually closely related to each other, as they make up a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pride of wolves or dogs, animals that have surprisingly much in common with lions (but not with other big cats).
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-grown roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of whined words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ozelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Researchers believe that the ozelots follow and find prey by smelling and sniffing the ground to find where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move completely unnoticed.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came, whether they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island where they cannot easily move back, they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
The new population will need different functions or adaptations than what they needed before to be a strong competitor, since this new environment has different resources and different competitors.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
When the new people eventually start to adapt to their new surroundings, they look less and less like the other population.
After a few thousand years or after millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We've named this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and we make our clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals would not survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, unafraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had more than 70 razor sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the upper mouth, no one who crossed its path came alive from it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had the wrong tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
In addition, it also attacked everything that came into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild pigs, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sycophant.
The fact that poor people and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, while the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals, was another difference.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods brought to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn or tomatoes, nor potatoes, or cocoa, and no older Romans have tasted turkey.
The Babylonians primarily built a temple to each god and these were seen as the home of God.
Humans brought offerings to the gods and priests attempted to fulfill the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary made for the god.
Houses were not essential in the high-temperature climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family lived for the most part in the open.
The women did the cooking in the garden; shops were only open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land around Canaan, making timber extremely expensive.
In Norse sagas, Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and when they found Greenland while traveling westward, they named it Greenland.
But there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time, independent of his discovery.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though all the countries were "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you can probably imagine that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Despite what is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So the note was probably added as a label.
The invasion and the following battles on D-Day liberated Northern France, but Southern France was still not liberated.
It was controlled by French "Vichy" individuals who had negotiated peace with the Germans in 1940 and actually worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The invasion on 15 August 1940, when the Allies invaded southern France, was called "Operation Dragoon".
In the course of only two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a fairly large number of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this defines in a way the size of society.
A civilization culture presupposes the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting linguistic footprint and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not seen as proper civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national leader or judiciary, it was dependent on state governments, which were usually unwilling to cooperate to enforce their actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax law and tariffs between the states.
The Articles needed unanimous approval from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took so lightly on the central government that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian and German national teams are the second best teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One are well liked sports.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the world's 7th largest island!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographic context, as an "island group".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 14th century when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and started a transition to indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work their rice fields and sugar plantations.
Forces from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took Taiwan's coastal areas in the west and north under control in 1683, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which continued to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three important structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976 and restoration continues today.
For example, 35 mm is still the most common format for still photography in the world, as it was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is that the digital camera's image sensor formats have inherited the size ratio of the camera.
It might be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (division by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio), is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS-family formats) are equal, or nearly equal, to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds is much abused and often ridiculed, but is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most efficient placement of the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized during this period in European history.
For thousands of years, Christianity had bound together European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-pervading authority touched everyone, from king to common folk.
One of the essential principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to diminish pain and poverty and that's why the money of the church is there.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy demonstrated the effectiveness of cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain bombed international waters to prevent any ships from entering whole parts of the ocean, creating danger for even neutral ships.
Germany was prepared for a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare as there was limited response to this tactic.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most inhabitants and nations were pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the horror of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for Edison's firm in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a reference letter from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces; the best-known of these periods were the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods there was fierce warfare between many kings fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history as thousands of people died while fighting for supremacy in the great palace at Xiadel.
There are a number of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a switch from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation is ruled by its citizens rather than by a single ruler.
Also after the revolution it was open to all male applicants which allowed the most ambitious and prosperous to succeed.
The same was true for the defense, because instead of military rankings based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was the motivation for other oppressed working class people in other nations to also start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that go beyond the mortal life. He often used a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light), where he went to think.
The cave itself, preserved over the years, gives a very vivid portrayal of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.
The only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, includes many pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), many small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, while many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upstroke" symbol looks like a V and the "downstroke" symbol looks like a pin or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and push the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more distinct.
You can use a pencil and make your own markings, but don't forget that the printed bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be taken into account.
The terrified royal household, King Ludvig XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette together with their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Ludvig-Charles aged 4) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were on 6 October 1789 pressured to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
The king and queen traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting threats at them.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows completely open.
A member of the gang swung at one point the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay for the cost of the war's American imperialism, in the conquest of the Philippines.
They had to tax with compulsion to the American colonial regime to cover large parts of the costs, and the interest on bonds went in the name of Philippine authorities via the banking houses of Wall Street.
The super-income derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people was a fundamental gain of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The age in which the events took place is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages in the period of European history that is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
The Mughal Empire did not interfere with society's culture and traditions for most of its existence, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, which led to more systematic, centralized and unified rules.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general conceptions: that the development of technology itself follows a trajectory that is beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology additionally has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that road development comes because of the car.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable if it is only used by a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce costs in car ownership.
Mass car ownership creates more accidents on the roads, which has led to the invention of new methods in the health sector to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a larger element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
What characterized Romanticism was that the landscape shaped individuals and that over time geographical habits and cultures arose, and that these, when harmonized with the position in society, were better than randomly imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the capital of fashion now in our time, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It has been known to be an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to around 1100 AD.
The status was not the same in the 12th century mainly due to the crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more appreciated than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, attire was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
But because of slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe started to create its own style, and one of the biggest changes that came about at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started to use buttons to close their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to just meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-storage agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses stored seeds belonging to the area combined with growth rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be special because of their members' age, ethnicity, class, area and/or gender.
The qualities that specify a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take as a starting point the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not adequately socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Some feral children have been kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents), in some cases due to parental rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
It is possible that children who are wild may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or managed to flee.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a wild child is completely raised by animals, it develops behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to that of the fostering animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it to a new level.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program, or beginning a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and physical. A teacher can also, in other words, be a kind of scaffold, but it's also the little binder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support functions have been added to the software and are intended to question, encourage, and explain approaches that may have been too challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No kid should have to grow up in an atmosphere that isn't nurturing and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should be able to provide all the necessities that they didn't have in the home they came from.
It is a combination of elements of both mass and interpersonal communication on the Internet.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are seen as important motivational factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord also identified "personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites (1998).
By using video recording, significant discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks suggests in his newspaper, The President's Speech, how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity correctly.
He also claims that such abilities to explain human behavior can be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
According to modern research, there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new gene variation and the selection removes it from the selection of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
It's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to get enough amino acids from the available plant resources out on the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has major consequences: stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The proteins found in leaves and legumes would be the most readily available plant sources, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without boiling them first.
Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are in contrast not only easily digestible, but they also provide high quantity proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of consciously awakening during the normal sleep period while falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a fairly quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find that you turn the alarm off in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythm involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, and this leads to having to get up to urinate.
How much inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with how much tension there is in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only thing standing in the way of that kind of insight is our own effort and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded to include the Mahayana love direction and several methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and total love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) can be awakened with kundalini yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Tibetan meditation revolves around god-yoga, the purification of energy channels through the visualization of various deities, which activates the chakras and enlightens the mind.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would really be fought, by proxy armies on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places from Africa to Asia.
By 17.09.1939 the Polish defense was already broken, and the last possibility was to return and reorganize along Romania.
These plans were nevertheless obsolete almost overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Peace Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II is one of the most important recent examples of this.
The German navy attempted simultaneously to stop this traffic, mostly using submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
It began with ancient cultures and tribes retaining them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that strolled on hills or other places for grazing, usually tended by goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar herder.
Wagonways in England were made as early as the 1500s.
Although the wagonways only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull themselves to achieve greater speeds and pull more cargo than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
In order to keep the spurs in place, the crossbar was introduced quite early; however, little by little it was realized that the spurs were more effective if there was a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the ironwork created more wear and tear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known mode of transportation. Humans began walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo erectus (meaning upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, and two-legged specialization has been discovered in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
We can start by adopting a lifestyle that is more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to some extent to minimize future pain.
This is often just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
The world has changed greatly from human scientific and technological advances, and difficulties have become more complicated due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
A handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and General Secretary Charles Thomson and then sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap after its introduction by Congress on July 4.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made through the night and these are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One reached George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the first handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and live to this day -- they're called birds.
Some people don't think of them as real dinosaurs because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still reminiscent of a dinosaur.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
So almost all PCs today are based on manipulating information that's coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are generally not sufficient for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic household items.
For first aid instructions specific to the poison in question, see the label.
Entomologists use the word insect in a formal sense for this income group.
This term derives from an old association with mites, insects highly adapted to attack humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or the house of their host.
As far as we know, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis across the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. Most scientific research is actually guided by this method.
Experimentation, however, is not limited to that, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the potential hypotheses by asking questions.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became more distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms seen in physiology and behavior are usually completely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been detected in virtually all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and not just as reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of independent cycles without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA could be a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts to tag either the DNA of the subject with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the subject with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are bacterial cells.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and examining details of the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people drive to work outside the village, while others drive in the opposite direction because their workplace is in the village they are leaving.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to, and a follower of, a transportation system based on private cars.
The science shows that the large carbon economy has loosened the biosphere from a stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems. Most people are dissatisfied with transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or about bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems produce such dissatisfaction, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complicated, since it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with some consistency so that traffic flow stays fairly consistent and can be mathematically calculated with a reasonable degree of certainty.
To better visualize the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three important properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of driving lanes.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier and more efficient for them to escape enemies, find food and mate.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
Because of this, they have several small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are earwigs and blowflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus believed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the world's largest and second longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, ten kilometers wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows out of the world's schools and into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon River, is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and technical achievements of the Giza pyramids.
Egyptians of the New Kingdom in ancient times marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It's the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language used by Vatican City in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language used in daily life by state employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every inhabitant of the Vatican is a Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since all of these are found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract, even with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of the earth's four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
The elements calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course you have metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that a few trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good helper for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, now that newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been deemed of lesser status and use.
People now type messages on PC screens, and never have to get close to a sniper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that to assemble a nucleus with more protons and neutrons, you need energy.
Sort of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart more or less unprovoked.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust, with the outermost layer called the crust.
The crust is around 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the long side.
Thinner under the maria, and thicker under the highlands.
It's possible that there's more magma on the side facing us because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and approach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about individuals that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Typically, when leaders begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors emerge: one part of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the crowd".
For this type of leader, it can be difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary measures, performance reviews, assign responsibility and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels he or she must change absolutely everything the team has done and make it their own.
At the end of the day, it's the leader who is responsible for whether the team wins or loses.
This behavior often ends in strife between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to many different time zones, which the local management may not always understand.
An "invisible team" that is present (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used effectively by all functional departments in an organization, creativity and innovation can occur.
The process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can thus lead to new innovative processes that can help meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create an innovation culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a way to provide assistance to organizations to improve performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, narrowing the scope and making it more precise.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior is a validation for researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
Brain structures and processes we've never seen before are now possible to study thanks to the emergence of new technologies.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes going on in our brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) gives a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, handling behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence is about making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control and planning of the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting analysis, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on coming up with solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and defense, as built into several home PCs and computer game software.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom. Teachers usually love to take students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology allows for a solution of virtual field trips where students can observe museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire great art while sitting with their class.
A great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes can also be to share the field trip virtually.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the nation's capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online for use as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience will generally change that.
The author of the blog began to improve his writing to avoid criticism, since students are often the most critical audience.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more updated on the world around them". The need to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that motivates students to work together, and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in relation to others, as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada with several art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and to the north, in Muskoka and further out, one finds untouched nature in all its beauty.
All this and more shows Ontario what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Large places to the north are very sparsely inhabited and some places are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of them, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the nations, and it became popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north it is bounded by the Sahel, in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: It is recommended that travelling ladies state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they will perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm etc.
Be determined to say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that still doesn't make it acceptable!).
The city we know as Casablanca today was founded in the tenth century BC, and was used as a strategic port under the name of Anfa by Berber fishermen, Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese tore it down, and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to leave it abandoned after a 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan built up the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was called Casablanca because of the Spanish merchants who had set up their trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
Places to buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hoods and a whole range of geishas, are easy to find around the old medina, but they are mainly sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is quite safe, all visits outside Goma should be read about in advance to understand the fighting that is going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing up the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the most affordable gorilla viewing in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis), which cost about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands, combined with relative inaccessibility.
Although Timbuktu has its own airport and its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, it is a very poor city.
Due to the threat of desertification, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 km2 and can be divided into 14 different ecological zones, supporting diverse wildlife.
This is one of the most popular attractions in South Africa and it is considered the finest national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card (a ticket), which gives access to either a selection of parks, or all the national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island, and is the place that many tourists consider as the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph displayed clearly thanks to the waters that make up Victoria Harbour.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront, which is opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is tightly packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and this is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The largest beach zone on the planet is the Sundarbans, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - here are some of the last remaining areas of jungle that once covered the gigantic plains.
The Sundarbans consists of an area of 3,850 km2 with about one third of the area covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 white-tailed deer in the area.
Buses run from the bus terminal (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, travel between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since district buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Small Japanese coastal buses that are both comfortable and solid serve most of the districts.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapok Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapok River connecting Oyapock and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters high and it has two files of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is fifteen metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay was the Guaraní, semi-nomadic hunters whose livelihood depended on agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Provinces of the Indies", became a country as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the natives.
The colonization period that lasted for 3 centuries was started by the Spaniards.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams with some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the poloban in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
See Asosiacion Argentina de Polo for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falklands, whose value is set equal to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley above the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what is an approved payment method.
It is difficult to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern part of the planet and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30 °C are common in the summer months.
The cold can be misleading in winter as the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is the same throughout the year.
Most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but still, the animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
You should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves according to the park authorities, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
Bison, elk, deer, bear and almost any large animal can attack no matter how peaceful they may look.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a safe distance.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly meals and keep your camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the official capital of Samoa in 1959.
When seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor in 1889, it became the notorious site of the Sea Protest.
Apart from one British cruiser, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting led to the assassination of the leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's two harbours, there are several beaches, the most popular being at three locations.
The North Shore beaches of the North Harbor district are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch all the way from Long Bay in the north to Devonsport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes you will find crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The most important local beer is "Number One", which is not a complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines that should be tested, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may fare better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For people from Australia, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign: a short black is "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The cocoa is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive, but fantastic.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and damage from any of these things is rare.
Still, accept advice from authorities, obey all posted signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Boksmanets occur near beaches and near rivers from October to April north of 1770 and may occasionally be observed outside this period.
There are sharks, but it is unusual for them to attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live primarily in the sea; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the road user peace of mind since they now have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although there may be opportunities to book lodging in other areas, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually sell package deals that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also reserve a seat for you if you need time to think about an offer or get other documents for your appointment (for example a visa).
Various changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival guards decide to camp at the site, and most guards consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where it's happening, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night even if the music on the main stage is finished.
At some festivals there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as driving through ice is extremely noisy for those most affected.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms and conditions).
Casinos tend to make many attempts to maximize the amount of time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment for the guests, so that they will be in a good mood and want to stay at the place.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Everyone who is going to drive in the mountains or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or cold.
The friction is low, so you cannot drive on ice and snow covered roads as you would on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the largest form of tourism that draws tourists to Africa and is the focal point for many visitors.
The term safari in popular parlance denotes travel to land to see the magnificent African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to approach cars and standard equipment, which will allow good viewing angles.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be quite shy and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bushwalk", or "balance walk") involves walking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will run from 24.08.2021 to 05.09.2021, with some events being held elsewhere around Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may struggle.
Cancellation rules vary, but since the end of March, the cancellation rules will not be extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most activity tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130 000, with typical tickets priced around ¥7000.
Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for loan, even if it is not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you want to avoid wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you are in doubt, you can buy the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may come across infectious animal diseases that they do not recognise from their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that are capable of harming or killing humans with their power, are usually not classified as plague.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods that are exempt from tax and can only be purchased at certain locations.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often goes through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a cool head: there are many steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important to respect them than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other places along the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are very tasty; in Bavaria they are rich and varied, comparable to the baked goods of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruitbakst is common, with baked apples year-round, and cherries and plums have their entrance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Many of the popular cakes taste extra good with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but filling pastries, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry dish is based on herbs and spices, mixed with either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be either dry or moist.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is regularly used in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation.
When used without further qualification, however, the term usually means food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by lightly spiced dishes, with a dominant taste of peanuts, chili, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stigbøyler hang down on each side of the hall and are supports for the rider.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can be less safe due to the possibility of a rider becoming stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse with one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged after the horse if it runs away.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Then some halls, especially English halls, have safety rods that allow the leather of the stirrup to fall down from the hall if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The largest climbing destination in Chile, Cochamó Valley, is known as South America's Yosemite, with many large granite walls and crags.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes in the endless seas of rock walls.
Outdoor snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve driving down snow-covered areas with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skibombers", who plan entire holidays around going skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 1600s, with the first recreational ski club opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking on skis: This activity also goes by other names such as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include, alpine style skiing, or alpine climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as something like a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk - but it is very rare that you will achieve great speeds without a heavy backpack in tow.
Europe is a fairly small continent, but it has many independent countries.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, functions more or less like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
At the same time, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax agencies consider items older than 100 years to be antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, including that the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and also important for the trade culture of many with other occupations.
Although traditionally not all Sami have been involved in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, while reindeer were mostly used as draught animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romanians, it is often seen as unflattering due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate impressions of the Romanian people.
If travel advice is issued for the country you are planning to visit, this may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also wish to consult authorities other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and simple compared to the more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all severe weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, severe social consequences or loss of human life.
Hazardous weather can occur anywhere in the world, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and forest fires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, heavy rains, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena consist of snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Those planning to visit countries considered to be war zones should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment courses" will likely return the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last two to five days and involves acting, some first aid and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for the journey home.
The government's willingness to issue passports where gender is not marked (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive.
Preoperative trans people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on a beach, reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated to some deeper sections, and a fast current allows deep water to form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim back upstream, which can be very problematic.
Once you get out of the current itself, swimming back is no more problematic than usual.
Try to aim at a place where you won't be pulled back or, depending on your skill and whether you've been spotted, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
A return shock occurs earlier than a culture shock (the stress phase is not there in the same way as with relocation), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adapt to their own culture anew.
When you return home after living in another country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the old habits of your home culture.
The first time you traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, since they know that the traveler must adapt to a completely new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the most exciting things in the area for kids is the pyramid's sound and light show.
The pyramids are visible at night and you have the opportunity to see them in peace and quiet before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors here.
The Sphinx is set both as a backdrop and as the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with 16 active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The area south of the peninsula is Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then emerge again and form the 360 km long mountain chain that is the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
Mount Vinson has an elevation of 4,892 metres and is located on Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, in the northern part or Sentinel Range.
In remote areas with no mobile phone coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot usually replace a mobile phone, as one must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to take a phone.
The service is often used by ships, leisure boats and in addition to expeditions that have remote data and contact needs.
You can get more information about connecting to this service from your local telephone service provider.
Travel education is a more and more widespread option for those who plan to take a gap year.
This is especially popular among Russians, so that they can take a gap year before university, without weakening their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into higher education when you return to your home country.
Usually, a school village will be registered in this type of education programme.
Finland is a great destination for boaters. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelago.
There is no need for a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Båtlivet is a national pastime in Finland with one boat per 7th or 8th person.
Although this is similar for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (as in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
The vast majority of the distinct Baltic Cruises had an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend a couple of full days in the historic town, and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you only go ashore using ship excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some of the cruises have included Berlin in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the trip there is therefore not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's no different than other things that a lot of people fear or dislike.
Understanding how the airplane works and what occurs during flight can help some to overcome fears of the unknown or of losing control.
Freight forwarders are paid a lot of money to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for smaller companies it was problematic.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through quicker was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to fork out a fat stack of cash for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This, however, will not be affordable: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for business class discounts or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of flyers who are willing to pay well to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
The multi-ethnic republic of Moldova has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member states.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the 3rd largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million.
Smyrna was formerly just an old city, but is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are drawn in with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century square together with old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to the European Mediterranean than the traditional Turkey.
The island of Eysturoy can be seen from the village of Haldarsvík, which also has an unusual octagonal church.
There are fabulous marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves in the churchyard.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling around the exciting village.
To the north and not too far away lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous among foreigners after Lord Byron gave it a glowing review.
Scotturb bus no. 403 travels regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you must also visit the great crypt of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian art popular throughout the world.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of almost immeasurable importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their time here, and many more who loved those who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Please do not damage the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Barcelona's official languages are both Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers Catalan, and most have an understanding of that language, but practically everyone speaks Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only in Catalan because it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements at the Metro station are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system with a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The reputation of Parisians is that they are egocentric, cheeky and arrogant.
Although often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get far in Paris is still to behave as well as possible, to behave as one who is "bien élevé" (well brought up).
The quick facade of the Parisians quickly disappears if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by much forest, mainly beech, fir and spruce trees, and is characterized by a mix of high mountain and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to many species of animals and birds.
There are rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, gaupe, wildcat and tiur, as well as several common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shawls to women who come unprepared, but bring your own and especially if it has bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear pants that go over their knees.
These may also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes may not have been washed after each wear, so it may be less comfortable to walk in these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially beef), and uses olive oil for everything.
A light and well liked dinner, at least in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Slices with olive oil, tomato and any accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns that stand with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even if it's in the middle of a sentence.
This is a significant method for distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It also makes the reading without a doubt easier, even if the writing is a little difficult, since one then has to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters to watch out for are c and g, since their pronunciation differs based on the following vowel.
In addition, the pronunciation of r and rr is different: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and fairly straightforward grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish quickly find that Portuguese is close enough that you don't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually somewhat obsolete in our time and are often used for museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution was not the type of problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or at study sites that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossoms displayed have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century and are also known as hanami.
The concept came from China where flowering plum blossoms were the most popular flower.
The first cherry blossom parties were arranged by the emperor of Japan only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
The plants look best in a natural setting, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one".
If you visit a formal garden and pick some "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is usually a high-security place, it's a very easy place to get to, and you can get most things there once you get there.
But if you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which does not happen as often).
There are also a few buses heading north to the city of Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes into Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, which is nearby.
The inland waterways can be a nice theme to base a trip on.
Visit for example the castles in the Loire valley, the Rhine valley or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide routes for popular hiking and bicycle trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions that we have during the holiday season have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to stay awake through the Easter night at an exposed point to see the sunrise.
It may well have been a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual, but there are of course also Christian theological interpretations of this tradition.
Several traditional churches often hold the Easter service on a Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with the congresses often starting the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The mammals were unable to make the journey due to the long distance to the mainland, and thus the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal on Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced after the arrival of humans, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to discover the Aurora Borealis, as the sky remains dark more or less around the clock.
Since the sites are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you will also have the opportunity to see the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Dress is standard job attire, and employees address each other by surname or job title.
Interaction is important in the workplace, with emphasis on group effort rather than individual performance.
Workers must often get their superiors' approval on any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
