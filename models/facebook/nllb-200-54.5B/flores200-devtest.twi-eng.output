This not only confirms that dinosaurs had at least feathers, something to eat, but also that their legs had descendants, such as spines and triangular structures.
Biologists say that the feathers of these animals were chestnut-brown above and yellow or carotenoid-colored below.
The fossil record also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have vestigial feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers suggested that the rachis came later than the fossil record.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were used not for navigation but for decoration or display. These researchers think that although this is a young dinosaur's plumage, it represents its shoulders and not its chick's down.
The researchers believe that although this is a replica of the dinosaur's jaw, it represents its jaws rather than a defense mechanism.

The Nabaguaku was Martelly's defense of his opponents that began in Ahinem.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were all caused by the failure to vote, some as far back as 2011.
Some 60 iPods reportedly malfunctioned and overheated, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) reports that 27 known accidents involving this device have occurred.
Last week, METI reported that Apple has implemented more than 34 security updates, which the company calls "moderate".
The Commission withdrew its response after calling Apple's postponement of the announcement "really regrettable"

Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "He was freaky like me... he was probably bigger than me... I love him and I'm gonna kiss him... I hope he's in a peaceful place.
The number of Australians opposed to independence increased by 8 percent in 2008 from 1,400 before the 2010 census.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
Based on the results of the poll, 29 percent said that Australia should become a republic immediately, and 31 percent said that Australia should never become a republic.
An Olympic gold medallist in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games was on the way, but his health was not well understood because of his diabetes.
He cannot take pain-reducing drugs because they are customarily taken in competition.
By January 25, Curtis Coope, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, had produced the largest known prime number.
Several people tested this with different hardware and software in early August and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source of Earth's water and organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Theosophists prefer to think of it as the birth of the planets, and especially as the birth of the Earth, since comets have collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year by signing legislation allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He described the nonsense as "political claptrap and nonsense".
It is unlikely that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a technology that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly without the need for dry-docking and will reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology that, unlike previous ground-based radar technology, allows air traffic controllers to direct aircraft more accurately and to communicate more effectively with the pilot.
There is no public transportation, no overground railway at Wembley, and no parking or park-and-ride facilities.
Shipping was going to be so difficult that they realized that they might have to close the gates and leave the club without supporters.
According to a study published in the journal Science, other birds have been created in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden maintain a two-generation tradition, which is thought to be much older, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be used to make a variety of shapes, from simple to complex.
It can be attached to thin wire, and can be rearranged and re-plaited. It can be folded and rolled into sheets.
It can be made small enough to be attached to the surface of the metal. It can be made so small that it can sometimes be used to decorate the hand-painted images in illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical's pH. You can make ketchup when using red cabbage juice.
The consistency of cabbage juice varies depending on whether it is treated with an acid or an alkaline solution.
The change in pH is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (because Hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
The two dry powdwes should be swirled together in a clean, dry, and uncontaminated hand.
Your contaminated hands react with the outer layers, forming a foam that forms a shell.
Cities such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in every home and a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of underground sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman times, toilets were sometimes located in private homes and public places.
If you want to call someone in a remote area, you use a satellite phone.
Satellite signals in the sky pick up the call and bounce back to earth, instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because some of Earth's atmosphere blocks our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] to lift a satellite or a telescope into orbit.
The wheel has revolutionized the world in many ways, not the least of which is its ability to accelerate travel.
To provide trains, as well as many other means of transportation.
At the bottom of the hierarchy are the nomadic pastoralists, who feed on animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.
There are also small mammals (including free-ranging species) that feed on small animals such as rodents, apes and birds.
Their secret is a niche, a niche that keeps them from competing with others.
Zebras and wildebeests, which live in groups called prides, are particularly at risk.
Prides consist of adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are related to each other, forming a family unit of sisters and daughters.
Pride zebras look like wolves or dogs, animals similar to zebras (but not remnants of zebras) in appearance and extremely dangerous to predators.
An all-around competitor, the cheetah has a new (though limited) ability to swim, jump backward, and pull five times the weight of a human.
Lions are in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as zebras, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of a lion is not the roar of a lion; nor is it the voice of a fierce lion.
Ocelats prefer small animals. Instead of being able to fly, they will eat bats, squirrels, rodents and birds.
Scientists speculate that ocelots are scavengers, living off the land.
At night they have excellent eyesight and excellent locomotion. The ocelots stalk and ambush their prey.
When a (small) group of organisms becomes separated from the larger group (e.g. from a mountain or river or from an island) they move to a new location where they cannot return to their original location.
The new neighborhood has new characters and competitors, so new teams will need new features or will have to adopt stronger competitors than they already have.
The love that was the foundation has not changed at all, they need the same adaptation as before.
In time, as the new arrivals settle in the new camp, they do not require as much, and the result is the same.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will replace each other without ever having a common origin.
We call this process specialization, which simply means that we are making new species.
Plants provide oxygen for humans to breathe, and they remove carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
Plants make it possible for us to build our homes and obtain clothing from plants. Most food is digested by plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the fiercest of its day, fearing nothing but the remains of mosasaurs.
Its long, fleshy jaw, with more than 70 incisors, including one in the roof of the mouth, means that nothing will ever get out of its way.
Its diet consists of crustaceans, large fish, mosasaur remains, and it may have fed on animals of the same family.
It attacked anything that got into the water, even dinosaurs the size of T. rex.
While some dishes may have been common, the Romans enjoyed unusual foods, such as wild boar, quail, quail eggs, and dormouse
Another difference is that while the poor eat their meals with her on couches, the rich prefer to share their meals and lounge with her.
Foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries ago could not have been part of ancient Roman cuisine.
For example, they did not eat corn, beans, lentils, or coconuts, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted coconut.
The Babylonians built shrines to their gods and considered them to be their homes.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods and the diviner would endeavor to fulfill the deity's wishes through rituals and ceremonies.

Sometimes pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were deliberately built in addition to the temple.
The heavens of the government have a sanctuary for the gods.
In the warmer climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most Hebrew families lived out in the open.
The women cooked their meals on the grass; the shops opened their canteens to serve the needy.
In the land of Canaan, firewood was scarce and very expensive.
In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red banished them from Iceland for murder, and that on his journey west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But as for the graves he found, Eskimos already lived in this area.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have distinct peoples, kings, customs, and histories.
After watching the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn after the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776, is inscribed with the words "Declaration of Independence".
While no one knows the exact type of onion used, it is known that originally the large parchment onion (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was the largest.
Hence, the letters may have been added as symbols.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had ended in northern France, but not in the south.
It was dominated by the French "Vichy", who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than against them.
On August 15, 1940, he landed in southern France in an operation codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and French troops liberated southern France and returned to Germany.
The eye is one of the most important cultural symbols of a community and plays an important role in society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which roughly corresponds to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civicats, meaning city or town.
The city-state is a global leader. An open culture means sharing knowledge across generations in a way that is long-lasting and inclusive.
The subculture disappears and gets rid of any evidence of witchcraft and makes it look like a hoax.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies were first united into a loose confederation - with only Congress as their counterpart - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes on the people, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it became the site's board of directors, who also assisted in enforcing all acts.
It also did not have the authority to dictate how the sites could split their fees and tariffs between the sites.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all websites before changes could be made and the websites did not take the central government seriously and often their representatives were absent.
Italy's national soccer team and Germany's national soccer team, the second-best in the world and the hosts of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, are on a collision course.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, badminton, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Figure skating competitions are very popular in the Northern hemisphere, and Italians compete in the Pancontinental Games and the Olympic Games.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island proportions, Japan's geographical position is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by the island and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company opened a trading post in southwestern Taiwan, replacing the aboriginal grain depot and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its sugarcane and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, warriors of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
At Machu Picchu are various structures, including the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Window of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the far end of the complex are designed to give visitors a glimpse into the past.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and is still under construction.
For example, the world's most common film format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size during the end of analog film.
Still in production today, nanotechnology is a major step forward in the development of digital cameras.
The format is usually 35 mm, sometimes narrower, with a diameter of 36 mm and a length of 24 mm.
Take the ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get a simple whole-number ration) of 3:2.
Many formats (APS family formats, for example) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The third has to do with stress and is often ridiculed as a simple guideline for dynamism while maintaining an image's measure of order.
It states that the critical points for the puzzles themselves are the intersections and intersection points of the lines that divide the three images (see example).
In the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, has been largely ignored.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their linguistic and cultural differences.
And his power, which was in all places, was from the king even unto the lowest.
One of the teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and misery and that the church exists for this purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the church's authority rested in Rome, and its focus on power and money made it a target for attack.
When hostilities broke out, Britain launched naval operations against the Germans.
The tactic cost both soldiers and civilians dear, even though it violated international norms established more than two centuries earlier.
Britain developed a submarine-launched ballistic missile to intercept ships on either side of the ocean and made it dangerous even for neutral ships.
But the strategy was largely unsuccessful, and Germany looked to a similar strategy with the submarine warfare system that had been developed in vain.
By the 1920s, most nationalistic societies considered war unnecessary and did not fight among themselves.
It was not until the end of World War I that the nations saw the horrors of war for what they were and determined that there would be no repeat of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a certificate from Charles Batchelo (his manager at his old company) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique system of chronology; each part of China, or dynasty, had its own imperial 'dynasty.'
Also in between each dynasty were a number of independent provinces. The famous period known as the Three Kingdoms epoch lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
Many princes of these times fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were the deadliest period in the history of Ancient China, with millions of people dying to occupy the great throne in the magnificent imperial palace of Xi'an.
Many concepts, such as the metric system, have political implications, ranging from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to the rulers.
After the 'Revolution' of 1917, the workplace was opened up to all men and it helped those with prospects to prosper.
Some went into the army believing that the power in the army was based on class and rank and would now be based on caliber.
The French Revolution galvanized the remnants of forced labor in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad desired much more than this mundane life. He often went to a cave which we called "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
cave himself, survived, gave a true picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
When you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
There you will see more than the beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains, only a fraction of which you will hear or see from inside the cave
The Great Pyramid of Giza is just one of the seven wonders that exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramids built in honor of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's valley of the Dead has many pyramids (the largest of which is very large), many small tombs, many burial sites, and a large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and shrines were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
The "up bow" makes the mark look like a V and the "down bow mark" looks like a staple or a square that has lost its shape.
Up means to start from the mouth and pull the bow, and down means to start from the frog (where the bow is held) and pull the bow.
The up-bow often produces a low-pitched sound, while the down-bow is louder and more penetrating.
You are free to use the pencil to make whatever you want but remember that printed bowing maaks are there for the music, so they should be respected.
Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were intimidated by King Louis XV and forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 by the merchant women of Vesaailies.
On board, they traveled to Paris, surrounded by cheering crowds who were judging the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open the ship's windows.
At one point a member of the mob even shook his head at the royal guards at Versailles in front of the queen and fainted.
The cost of the U.S. war of aggression was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
U.S. taxpayers were made to pay the principal and interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
U.S. imperialism profited from the disrespectful treatment of Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the contest that led to the creation of the order.
The period is often referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages continued until about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term with several meanings, ranging from technological determinism or technological determinism to the assumption that human behaviour is somehow related to the laws of science and the way it manifests itself in technology.
The definition of technology is often based on two assumptions: that technological progress itself is influenced by culture or politics, and that technology "connects" rather than unites the countries in which it is used.
For example, one might say that touch makes roads safer.
But the existing methods were too costly, so we discarded the alternatives in order to minimize the cost to the victims.
Increased traffic leads to more accidents on the roads, and alternative treatments for paralysis are becoming more common.
Romanticism was characterized by a strong cultural influence from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography took precedence over the individual and over time customs and traditions evolved that were geographically appropriate and, because of their relevance to the nation, transcended the narrow confines of established law.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital, so Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of imperial Europe.
It is best described as a beautification project that began in 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
His standing declined in this fiftieth year because the warriors gave him gifts such as frankincense and spices that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was then that the City of Beauty was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, Byzantine culture influenced dress in the east.
But because of slow communications, western styles will be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own styles.
Subsistence farming and subsistence agriculture produce only enough food for the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system of supporting crops in an ecoregion combined with crop rotation or simple techniques to increase the yield of crops.
Subsistence farming was common in ancient times and continues to be a thriving industry today.
A subculture within a larger culture includes individuals who are challenged by societal standards and allowed to maintain a sense of identity.
Subcultures within a larger culture can be divided by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture from a larger culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination thereof.
Members of a subculture within a larger culture often express themselves through styles and rules, including fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the best ways to illustrate the value of socializing is to separate children from adults through isolation, danger, or coercion during their formative years.
Some people have possessed feral babies (usually their own offspring); sometimes these babies are abandoned due to physical defects or hematomas.
The feral cubs may have suffered extreme stress or torture before escaping.
Some were even said to have been heard by animals; others even claimed to have lived in the wild.
Not raised by humans, an anthropomorphic child displays the behavior (in part by barking) of a trained animal, which is fearful of humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, scaffolding is more than that.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique but a tool that helps individuals learn something new, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new job.
Scaffolds can be abstract or concrete, in other words, a teacher is a scaffold but a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are software tools used to ask questions, make prompts and explain why it might be difficult for a student to solve on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are deprived of proper nurturing, care, and education.
We feel that the Day Care Center is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide warm homes, loving caregivers, inclusive education, quality health care
Foster care is supposed to fill needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet has blurred the lines between public and private communication.
The unique role of the Internet has also revolutionized graphic design.
For example, "education" and "social networking" are perceived as motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Engagement" and "communicative competence" were found to be other motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience response to websites.
The use of video recording has revolutionized the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
It has been suggested that lying can be detected when microexpressions are tolerated well.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", describes how people misunderstand language because of distorted thinking and cannot get everything right.
He even suspected that dogs shared the same instincts as humans.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation pools:
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and this selection is made from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination allow variation to occur between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system like that of humans finds it difficult to obtain its amino-acid requirements from the growing vegetation.
Moreover, if not treated, the consequences are not so serious: growth depression, nutritional deficiencies, and death.
Vegetables and legumes are a good source of protein, but they are difficult for primates to digest because chicken takes a long time to cook.
In contrast, insects (ants, termites, etc.) are slow-growing, high-protein plants that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our tubercular ancestors dealt with their "protein problem" as savannas do today.
Sleep cycling is the practice of waking up from sleep and returning to sleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
To do this, we literally wake you up with a silent alarm clock to help you stay awake.
If you are going to set the alarm yourself, you can set it in another part of the house, where it will wake you up before you go to bed.
Biorhythm-based sleep hygiene includes drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, with a known diuretic) before bedtime to promote wakefulness.
The tranquillity enjoyed by humans contrasts with the physical and emotional turmoil.
Every human being has the right to seek and enjoy true peace.
One of the obstacles to this sense is our own appetite and appetite for food.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but we extend the mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is much simpler. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the practice of love.
It is Kundalini YogaKundalini energy (energy of awakening) through yoga poskya, breathing exercises mantras and anituade 'visualizations'.
Tibetan meditation and Divine Yoga. Through the discovery of many deities, the paths of the senses are cleared, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was an enemy in World War II, which led to the USSR and the USA forming an alliance. By the end of the war, the clashes of systems, methods and cultures had caused the collapse of these countries.
Within two years of the war's end, allies became enemies and the Cold War began
It would take 40 years for proxy armies to fight wars from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had collapsed, and the only hope was to fight again and re-establish the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan was never completed, as more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and Belarusian and Ukrainian troops marched into Poland's eastern provinces in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping lanes are the most efficient way to move goods and cargo across the ocean.
The navy's traditional role has been to ensure that your country can move its people and supplies from place to place while at the same time preventing enemy movement of people and supplies.
Especially noteworthy was the third North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, German submarines, especially U-boats, struggled to stop the traffic.
If the League had not intervened, Germany might have won a victory over Britain, just as it had over the rest of Europe.
Goats probably became domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their milk, wool, meat, and meat products.
Domesticated goats were kept in herds that roamed the mountains or grazed on the open pasture, and they were tended by young or adolescent teamsters, as well as by familiar shepherds.
Camel tracks were built in England in the early 16th Century.
Even though the wagon tracks were made of rough wooden planks, they enabled horses to run faster and to pull heavier loads than on the busier roads of the day.
However, it was gradually realized that the wagons could be made to move only if a few rails were attached to the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron weakened the iron of the chariot's wheels.
Eventually, four iron coaches replaced the wooden ones, and in 1767 an iron rack railway was unveiled.
The earliest form of human locomotion, the bipedal gait, began two million years ago with Homo Erectus.
Their successors, the Australopithecines, always walked on eggshells.
There is evidence of bipedalism in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live peaceably in our present neighborhood, we can join the guerrilla movement, and we can get involved in politics in order to reduce to some extent the suffering we will face in the future.
However, to avoid a short-term solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and eliminate it once and for all.
It is not so clear that the world has changed dramatically as a result of advances in anthropology and technology and that the problems have increased because the world population has increased and the lives of many people are filled with debauchery.
When their Synod changed to this new format after July 4, a decree signed by the president of the General Synod, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
At night there are between 150 and 200 copies, known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
John Nixon read the book's first public reading in the lobby of Independence Hall on July 8.
Copies were sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had them read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest copies of the book. The original handwritten copy could not have survived.
Paleontologists believe that a group of mammals called dinosaurs lived and are still alive today.
Many people do not think of themselves as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But it has given rise to a fascination with birds that still parallels that of the dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Probably all modern computers are based on binary code.
Binary numbers can have only two digits, 0 or 1, and these are expressed as binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Toxins may not show up right away. Some symptoms, such as vomiting, can be caused by any number of circumstances and therefore cannot be diagnosed immediately.
A good indicator of oral poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or an overdose of home remedies.
Make sure that the bottle contains first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is often used by entomologists to refer to insects.
The term comes from Bed-bugs, which are parasites that can live inside humans.
Both insects and worms return to their mothers after a long, sudden absence to mate or lay eggs.
Throughout the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the number one mental illness in children and adolescents.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to have a child.
This couple may arrange for an abortion for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish control of the child so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of natural philosophy is to explain how the world works through the process of physics. This process guides the investigation of physics.
Not only that, but experiments, tests to rule out one or more explanations, questioning, and observation also aid in the investigation of physics.
Naturalists and philosophers were intrigued by the parallelism between the text on the front and, especially, the text of the Holy Scriptures in Latin.
Aristotle's views on natural philosophy, including psychology, were adopted.
As Greek learning declined, Western scholars found themselves increasingly cut off from their Greek philosophical and natural philosophical roots.
Many of them also suggested that the rhythm of cellular activity and behavior is determined by endogenous factors and by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, rather than simple seasonal patterns, are characteristic of living organisms, including microorganisms, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a series of self-sustaining oscillators that will continue in free-running cycles even if there are no external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA was part of our genetic makeup.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or bacteriophages, to convert their own DNA into a small pathogen.
Two experiments were conducted, one in which radioactive phosphorus was used to label the DNA in bacteria and the other in which radioactive sulfur was used to label the bacteria's proteins.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the pattern of mutation, and part of the advantage of dying is that the surviving organisms are germ-line organisms.
Mutations in germ-line cells are passed from parents to offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause apoptosis or cancer.

Why do collisions occur, why are mistakes made every day, are collision engineers unemployed, or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual carriers and the flow of traffic between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Admittedly, traffic is more difficult to study because you cannot predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
On the positive side, drivers display a pattern of randomness; hence, traffic patterns are logical and can be expressed mathematically.
To make traffic more visible, three key attributes have been linked: (1) size, (2) weight, and (3) speed.
This partnership is instrumental in the planning, design, and operation of shipping routes.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose ability to fly enabled them to evade predators without fatigue and to obtain food and shelter more efficiently.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings back close to their skin.
This gives them plenty of places to hide from predators.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
A thousand years earlier, his great-uncle Aristarchus had proposed that the planets revolve around the sun.
While some people thought that what he said was true, many believed the opposite; that the planets revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other planets).
This makes sense, since we do not feel the earth rotate, do we?

The chemical elements that make up such precious metals as gold, silver, and copper have long been known to man, and they can all be found in nature in the earth's crust and are easily extracted with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of at least one of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
These were analogous to the four states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, he added, adding that they could be transformed into other forms of matter.
A compound is a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Certain minerals, such as calcium and potassium, are classified as metals.
Alloy steels can be made from nonferrous metals, such as carbon.
Each molecule is made up of hundreds of atoms, and each atom is made up of hundreds of atoms.
Atoms are so small that a billion of them could fit into the period at the end of this word.
As a result, the quill was a valued companion when it appeared.

A fission bomb works on the principle that it releases energy and forms a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy box up a hill, it squeezes the nucleus again and releases some of the energy.
Some atoms have moving nuclei, which means that they move apart when they are pushed or pulled apart.
The moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, which form a crust around the moon.
The mass of the rocky crust is about 70 km at the equator and 100 km at the poles.
It is narrow where it is thick and heavy where it is thin.
More powerful eruptions may have occurred nearby because the rocky terrain is flat and soft enough for volcanic debris to reach the surface.
Puzzles are designed to provoke or amuse.
These statements imply that people have certain needs and/or desires that are instilled in them as they grow into adulthood.
These articles examine what motivates people to do certain things and what environmental factors can influence them to do or not to do certain things.
Two of the most popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Basically, two attitudes can cause a person to lose his job if his superiors begin to dominate his former colleagues.
Such a manager finds it difficult to make decisions, to give direction, to monitor performance, to assign tasks, and to point out errors.
In the other case, the person changes into a different personality and feels compelled to change the way the group does things and to do things his way.
After all, the success and survival of the group are in the hands of the leader.
That attitude often creates a division between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual group chats are as good as conventional group chats, but there are a few differences.
Virtual group counseling serves as a place where visible group counselors receive help from the moment they need it.
They are more effective than conventional group counseling because group counselors can meet at different times because they are in different locations but may not understand the counseling in their country.
The existence of an "invisible community" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is distinct from a virtual community.
An "invisible team" is a group of workers in which each member is accountable to someone else.
Why would a group want to go through the time-consuming process of forming a study group?
If resources are used effectively among the diverse women who work in the group, creative thinking and knowledge will flourish.
As a result, the way a group works together to overcome an obstacle may open up a new avenue for meeting the needs of its customers.
For a group to become more diverse, leaders must create a culture that encourages diversity and the sharing of knowledge and group learning.
Angel (2006) defined the Continuum approach as a process for helping the team achieve its performance goals.

Despite the strong philosophical underpinnings of AI, AI is one of the most important branches of the philosophy of computer science, being an intersection of behaviorism, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
In AI research, artificial intelligence, which simplifies tasks and requires knowledge of behavior, plays a role.
Some examples are the ease of use, the complexity and design, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, and the ability to mimic handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
The body has become a self-contained system, designed to deal with the problems of this life.
AI systems are now used in finance, medicine, engineering, and the military, thanks to their development of home computer and video gaming software applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any classroom program. Often a teacher will want to take his students to many places that cannot be reached by plane.
Technology provides a seal through virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or view fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip with others through social networking is a good way to plan a trip and share it with future students.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a Web page about their trip to the State Capital, changing the layout of the site each year but keeping the previous page as a journal.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the attention they receive will change that.
Since students are the target audience, bloggers strive to be well-written and to avoid controversy.
Blogging also "provides students with a new way of perceiving the world around them". The desire to reach out to those who are responsive to their needs makes blogging both educational and fun (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the confines of a traditional classroom.
Blogs, when used appropriately, "can encourage students to think critically and analytically; by responding quickly to the world wide web, students are able to express their views on what others have written as well as how they feel about a particular topic (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's picturesque, bilingual capital, with colorful art galleries and museums that house Canada's national treasures.
