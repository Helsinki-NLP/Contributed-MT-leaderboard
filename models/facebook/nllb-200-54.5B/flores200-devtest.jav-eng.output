USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We concur with the USOC's explanation that the interests of athletes and clubs, and of the sport, may be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes to the organization, rather than by not certifying.
American gymnastics advocates an independent inquiry that may shed light on how the abuse of proportions so boldly stated by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone unnoticed for so long and embraced every necessary change and correction.
American gymnastics and the USOC share a common goal - to make the sport of gymnastics, and more, safe - especially for athletes pursuing their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

This not only confirms the existence of feathered dinosaurs, a widespread theory, but there are generally no fossils for which evidence exists, such as coloration and three-dimensional shapes.
Scientists describe the animal's fur as brownish-bean on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had the characteristics of other feathers - spines and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather to regulate temperature or appearance.
Researchers have pointed out that although these are the tails of young dinosaurs, the samples show adult feathers and not juveniles.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The changes that the team members are looking for are those produced by tidal forces between the invisible matter of the galaxy and the invisible matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that this invisible matter affects other matter in the same way that other visible matter does.
This theory states that a large amount of dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo of light, and is made up of many small particles.

In France voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a room, handing over a pre-printed piece of paper showing the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After an official checks the voter's identity, the voter places an envelope inside the ballot box and signs the voter list.
Election laws in France are more stringent in regulating the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be clear so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes were present near the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added other than those of authorized and officially counted voters.
In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "publishing photos of suspects would be extremely dangerous for journalists".
The Crown Office, which is in full charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to news reports, would set out the borders, which the Palestinians want according to the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future shape of Jerusalem being sacred to all nations and the matter of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded the return of its soldiers who had wandered into the valley for ten years after an agreement was signed in which the PA agreed to leave its presence for only five years.
Shooters in pest control trials must be closely supervised by a supervisor, as this training is monitored and evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers are recruited, under the auspices of the Sport Shooting Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received safety instructions and extensive training.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods becoming unusable due to heat have been reported, causing six fires and injuring four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Trade (METI) says that there have been at least 27 such accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple was reporting 34 additional accidents due to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by saying that the report by Apple was "absolutely reprehensible".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (09.19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said that no damage had been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman holds a Hong Kong tourist hostage by hijacking his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were released and at least six are presumed dead to date.
Six mujangan, including children and the elderly, were released first, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a general practitioner and began working at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
It was while she was working at the hospital that Liggins began researching premature births in her spare time.
Research suggests that the hormone administered will accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black boxes' of the flight voice recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was my first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is just as weird as I am...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the total of 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 federal election, those who disagreed with Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard admitted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those who voted expressed this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the session, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist will swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness is in doubt.
He is currently unable to take medication to deal with his pain as it is prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people tested the discovery using different software and hardware in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of delivery of water to earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because in the past comets have collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and has dealt with same-sex marriage lawsuits.
He called the rumors "political bullshit and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to point aircraft with higher accuracy and give pilots more complete descriptions.
No additional transport was undertaken and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear that there will be a shortage of vehicles increases the chance that these games will have to be played delicately without the support of their supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species blooms in only two generations, although this method is believed to take much longer, due to the interaction between Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortress, and the cactus pit finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape.
It can be made into very thin wires, which can be stretched and planted.
They could be made so thin that they adhered to other metals and were sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical compound is.
This pH level is marked by the number of Hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton from which an electron has been stripped (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Place the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will make it feel funny and resemble a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected by modern waste disposal procedures.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up the call and then bounce it back down, almost instantaneously.
Satellites are sent into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of its own light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket that is 100 feet tall to lift a satellite or telescope into the sky.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways.
This has made it possible for us to have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below that are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from deer to deer and rabbits.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat more abundant small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success was the concept of positioning, a special artifice that each cat possessed that prevented cats from competing with one another.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males, with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Female lions are usually closely related, forming large families of sisters and daughters.
The pride of lions acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that strangely resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also deadly to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with the strength of five men.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion that has a full voice, but it is like a frightening phrase and screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they can.
Scientists think that ocelot cats follow and even find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing out where the ground is.
They can see in the dark with night vision, and can also move silently.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot move again easily) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different appearances or adaptations to become strong competitors than previously required.
Most of the original inhabitants have not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means a new form of a species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Trees make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its day, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is supported by more than 70 slender teeth, and also with additional teeth at the top of its lip, meaning there is no escape for anything that gets in its way.
Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have fed on other animals.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would be no match for it.
While almost all cuisine there would be familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange or unusual ingredients including, wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor man and woman light their food by sitting on chairs, the rich man likes to light together where they sit side by side while lighting their food.
The Ancient Roman diet could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they completely abstained from corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, and none of the ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built huge temples to their gods, whom they viewed as household gods.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to care for their needs through ceremonies or festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower, called a ziggurat, was built as part of the temple.
The upper part of the tower was a special shelter for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not of great importance.
Many Hebrew families lived outside their territory.
The women cook in the courtyard; the stalls merely open a trading table facing the street. The stone is used to build the house.
There were few forests in the land of Canaan, and wood was expensive.
Greenland is sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for killing people, and while travelling further west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of how it was discovered, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have very different people, kings, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the back of the letter may say something, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) were rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is highly likely that the note was added just for the label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was led by "Vichy" France.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces were able to liberate southern France and push back into Germany.
A civilization is a single custom shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning inhabitant, and civitas, meaning city or urban condition, which in turn may determine the size of a society.
The culture of a civilization implies the inheritance of cross-generational insights, enduring cultural traces and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as the civilizations they were supposed to be.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and, in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, relies on state governments, which are often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also lacks the authority to raise taxes and price controls between states.
All member states had to agree to the Articles before they could be amended and these other member states underestimated the central government because their representatives so often did not sign.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team are the second most successful teams in the world and FIFA world cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, pitch-pitching, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the North, with Italy participating in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan occupies nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Existence of island groups Located within Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "island" country.
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European fishermen passed by and named the island Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base on the southern tip of Taiwan, which began a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and recruited Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings located on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of the early things.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored.
For example, the world's most common still photography format is 35mm, where it was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
35mm is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm and 24mm wide.
The aspect ratio of this format (multiplied by twelve to produce the simplest number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
More common formats (e.g., formats from the APS family) have the same or close to this aspect ratio.
The third most-often-abused rule is a simple guideline when it comes to creating dynamism while also maintaining a sense of order within an image.
This suggests that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become increasingly wealthy and powerful, entered a period of scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united Europe despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
All this is about the strength that influences everyone from the king to me.
One of the tenets of Christianity is that money should be used to help the needy, and that is what church coffers are for.
Central church authority had been vested in Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle had been followed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
This policy proved effective, and manned important military and civilian supplies, although these sieges violated generally accepted international law governed by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The British placed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering their territorial waters, endangering neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this plan, the Germans expected a similar response with unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, actions taken by citizens and nationalists were against both the war and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were determined to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States upon accepting a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager of his previous employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had an unusual way of representing eras; each level of Chinese or each dynasty in power was a distinct dynasty.
The most notable of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This period of fierce warfare occurred when many noble bloodlines vied for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China.
There was considerable influence from social and political conditions such as the usefulness of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belonged to all the people rather than to a single leader.
Also after the Revolution the job was opened to all male applicants allowing only the most ambitious and successful men to have results.
The same was true for the military because the ranks of soldiers were as much based on their class as they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to the cave now known as the Cave of "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
His own cave, which survives to this day, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it's there.
There is nothing to see except the beautiful, clear sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Dead Valley has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was made in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family.
The "up arrow" mark looks like the letter V and the "down arrow" mark looks like the contents of staples or a box missing its bottom.
Going up means you have to start from the top and push the paddle, and going down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand is holding the paddle) and pull the paddle.
A curve above this notation usually produces a softer sound, and a check mark above this notation usually produces a stronger, more emphatic sound.
Feel free to write in your own sign, but remember the curved corner sign is there because of the music, so it should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoniette their two young children (Marie Theresa aged 11 and Louis Charles aged four) and the King's sister, the frightened Lady Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In his carriage, he returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted insults at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to roll down their chariot windows.
At one point, a member of the assembly carries the severed head of a murdered royal official to Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to finance their lavish state spending and interest on bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from their long exploitation of the Filipinos would become the fundamental profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a phrase that refers to a wide range of views on practice, from a technological determinism or technological necessity to a strong sense that human destiny is determined by a mind that is fundamentally tied to scientific rules and their manifestation to technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common assumptions: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely uninfluenced by cultural or political forces, and that technology also has "effects" on society as a whole, rather than being determined by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that if machines could build roads, then humans could build roads.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of driving a car.
Mass car ownership also led to more accidents on the roads, which invented new techniques for maintaining health and repairing damaged car bodies.
The romantic literary style has a strong element of cultural determinism, reflected in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerge, and these, in harmony with the place of society, are preferable to arbitrarily enforced laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern age, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of ancient Europe.
Famous for being a center of expensive and beautiful tools began about 400 A.D. and flourished until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with goods such as silks and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the move of the Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop its own styles.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture undertaken to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, method of using seeds originally saved for an ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other simple means of expanding it.
Generations of farmers have been heavily involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Cultural branching brings together like-minded people who feel disconnected by social hierarchy and can foster a sense of identity.
Cultural branches can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The defining qualities of a branch of culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religiously related, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural branch often mark their membership by using distinctive and symbolic styles, which include dress, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to capitalize on the disadvantaged cases of children who, neglected, pitied, deliberately abused, were not consulted by adults during childhood.
Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases these children are abandoned due to the parents' refusal to severely damage the child intellectually or physically.
A rebellious child may have been abused as a child or may have been afraid of abandonment or of running away.
Others are thought to have been brought by animals; a few are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
When treated by non-human animals, the child exhibits wild behaviour (with certain limitations) almost entirely similar to that of mainly animal treatments, such as fear and even indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but an aid that provides support for people who have new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but also a small paperclip contained in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in software and is aimed at asking, requesting, and explaining procedures that can challenge students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse, and even coercion.
No child should have to grow up in a situation where they are not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they are.
We feel the Foster Child Protection System is a safe zone for these children.
Storage communities should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular nursing, and reliable healthcare storage.
The child's caregiver must provide for all the needs that are lacking in the home that were taken from previous children.
The Internet combines elements of group and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in usage terminology and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous interaction" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of videotape has resulted in important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that occur in milliseconds.
In particular, it states that one can discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Lecture, demonstrates how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in addition to negating human behavior may also be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variants: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes this from the pool of variation it expresses.
Segregation and recombination of random types alternate between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to satisfy their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, such feelings of failure can lead to serious problems: depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources are proteins that are readily available in leaves and pods, but they are difficult for primates such as humans to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high-quality proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Upon reflection, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
A sleep disorder is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep time and going back to sleep again after a short period of time (10-60 minutes)
This can be done easily by using a slightly alarmed alarm clock that can wake you up without waking you up with a start.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your bed, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up from where you are to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of water (especially water or tea, known to induce a lot of urination) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of strength in the person's body and mind.
The lower the level, the better the life force is there. Everyone can find ultimate peace and happiness.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this quest is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but developed by the Mahayana path of love and by all the methods of Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are simple: Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path to embrace all of love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is raised through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and shadows.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
With the end of the war two years earlier, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought bravely, by mighty armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and their only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the draft was created that night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian armies following the violent invasion of Poland's eastern territories of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to move goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
A navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move men and goods, but at the same time, to disrupt your enemy's ability to move his men and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic military operations of World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop his progress.
If the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to defeat Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Sheep appear to have been first violently domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
These ancient cultures and tribes maintained easy access to trade routes for milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domestic sheep are generally kept in groups of animals scattered over hills or other areas, which are often tended by sheep herders who are often children or adolescents, much like the shepherds commonly known.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon train rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled horses pulling wagons to travel faster and to pull larger loads than on slightly rougher roads.
Rail bearings were introduced relatively early to hold rails in place, but over time it became increasingly apparent that rails would be more efficient if they had iron on top.
This became a common practice, but its widespread use led to increased wear on the wooden wheel arches of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The earliest known vehicles were walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus did not walk upright on a daily basis.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs rapidly within the last seven million years.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become leaders in reducing future suffering to some degree.
But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we have to find the source of these things, and we have to deactivate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problems are getting bigger due to the overpopulation and wasteful lifestyle of human beings.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft of its contents was signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap spread".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9.
25 The Dunlap fragment is the only known complete copy of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many NGOs argue that these animals are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many parts of birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of randomly generated information encoded in binary numbers.
Twin digits can have a rank of only one or two, such as 0 or 1, and these digits are called twin digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, may be so mild as to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The most visible sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or household chemicals that contain toxins.

The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Killer mites and bed bugs are both altricial, adaptations to living in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the United States alone, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a prominent neurological disease of middle-aged and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of the child, to keep the baby.
These couples may choose to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another spouse may become the child's parent.
The ultimate goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method.
Not only that, an experiment, and an experiment is a method used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid close attention to ancient writings and, in particular, to the Gospels in Latin.
Aristotle's views were acceptable to all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from its Greek roots scientifically and philosophically.
Many observations of rhythm in physiology and behavior often rely heavily on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production via the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, rather than being simply responses to external periodic grades, have been shown to be true for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue its pitch-free time of flight even in the absence of external cues.
The Harshey and Chase experiments were one of the key elements that proved that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
He did a double-blind experiment of labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, meaning which genetic material is affected and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations within the cells of a multicellular organism can be passed on to offspring, and mutations elsewhere can cause cancer or cell death.
Nature-based excursions can attract many people who want to venture into nature for the purpose of observing the scenery, including plants as well as wildlife.
Examples of on-site opportunities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and observing ecosystems.
For example visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town on their bicycles to go to work and meet others who work in the same small town.
In this dynamic commuting world everyone is figuring out how to connect to, and support, a transportation system based on private cars.
Current knowledge suggests that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of the steady states that have supported human desertification over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about the quality of water or bridges.
Why does the transportation system make people complain, why does the system fail every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
For example, it can be difficult to keep up with the flow of traffic because the driver's habits are unpredictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a consistency that is understandable and can be represented mathematically.
To better visualize traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main conditions: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of highway facilities.
They were among the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so enabled them to avoid predators and to find food and mates more easily.
Most long-lived insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are ladybugs and ladybugs.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that our solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think they are free but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, having a width of six miles.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and sophistication.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of its ancestors, which at the time had remained intact for over four thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian was also the language spoken by many who worked in the area, and Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the properties of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of four basic elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is very similar to the problem of the four states of matter (in the same way): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also considers them changing into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
It is also possible to have alloy metals that have small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter.
An atom is so small that billions of atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Later, pencils became a valuable companion for many when they went out in public.
Sadly, as newer methods of writing have come out, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to get closer to each other to get closer.
One can only wonder what became of the typewriter when something newer came along.
A fission bomb follows from the principle that energy is required to fuse together a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break apart with little or no thrust.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the mountains.
It is possible that there are more maria on its sides because the crust is thinner.
Content theory is central to discovering what makes people choose or engage.
The theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized by the time they enter adulthood.
These theories observe what it is about certain people that causes them to want to do what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain actions.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can be seen when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking organized action, honoring work, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one morphs into an unrecognizable individual who feels he (the male) or she (the female) must overturn everything the group has done and make it his or her own.
Either way, the leader has absolute responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This often creates a gap between the leader and other team members.
Virtual squads have similar benchmarks of excellence to conventional squads, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for immediate physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than a regular squad member because their value is in being able to meet different time zones that may or may not be known to the location manager.
The presence of an explicit "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
An invisible team is a management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used with good results in all functional parts of the organization, creativity and excellence can occur.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovation process to serve the needs of its subscribers.
Before organizations can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation and also be able to share knowledge and learning in an organizational manner.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum method as a practice used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a way to prove the theory of consciousness checking.
The connection between brain disease and behavior supports scientists to investigate.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine structures and processes in the brain that were previously unknown.
It also provides us with an enormous amount of information and material to build biased inference models that help us understand how our minds work.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI makes up a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, study and intelligent adaptation inside a machine.
Research is underway on AI in addition to creating machines to perform tasks automatically that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include self-control, planning and assertiveness, an aptitude for responding to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
In doing so it has become a different discipline, one that focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the like, as they have been built into many home computer devices and gaming applications.
The field school was an important part of the classroom, and the teacher would take the students to a place where the bus could not pass.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a field trip is actually also a way to visualize a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year a student from the Bennet School in North Carolina creates a web page about their trip to the State Capital, each year the web page is updated, but the old version stays online so it can be used as a scrapbook.
Although students often begin their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, bloggers began trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The need to feed the curiosity of these visitors inspired the students to be active and playful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more inquisitive and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can determine their understanding of the context of others' writing and clarify their own views on a particular issue (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant, bilingual capital city and boasts a collection of art galleries and museums reflecting Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north are areas of untapped natural beauty from Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas of the north are sparsely populated and some have large forests that are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many: African Americans living in America outnumber Canadians.
The islands of East Africa lie in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar, the world's largest island, is a unique continent in its wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known for their luxurious coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the island, and were a major route to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north it is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended to tell women who are traveling to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is helpful to also wear rings (though these tend to be expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to friction and that they are not used to being followed, held in the arms, etc.
That means rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (different culture or not, it doesn't work well).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the building and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt his city under the name of Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who were able to establish a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, you can find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, porcelain, leather goods, pipes, and geegaw depictions of all kinds, but they are only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern outskirts near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava flows from Mount Nyiragongo that buried many towns and streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any press outside of Goma must be studied to understand the constant state of war in North Kivu Province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with hiking the trail to find the lowest Mountain Gorilla in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (bicycle taxis) to get to Goma.
Combined with the lack of connectivity, "Timbuktu" has been used as a nickname for exotic and remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it is a popular tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger was increased, due to the threat posed by sand dunes.
This was one of the times he stopped by during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from the rest of the country, as it has more Arab residents than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Boyo River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, all suitable for animals.
It is one of the premier amusement parks in South Africa and is said to be the mainstay of South African National Parks (SANParks).
And for all South African National Parks, there is a conservation day and an entrance fee for the park.
It can also be advantageous to those who purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to selected destinations in South Africa or to South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and it is the place that many travelers consider its main hub.
The procession of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyscrapers is contrasted with a chart of illuminated bars made visible by the presence of water from Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon seafront.
Much of Hong Kong island is heavily urbanised development on reclaimed land on the north coast.
It is a place that the British colonists called their own and if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remnants of the mangrove forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water.
Since 1966 the Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer have been seen in the area.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and Jakarta/Bumthang leave between 06.30 and 07.30.
Since buses from one district to another are often full, I can tell you that it is better to book tickets several days before departure.
Many districts are served by the Japan Coast Ship Bus, which is sturdy and comfortable.
A shared taxi ride is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters and have two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group currently living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic herders who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, farming and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called the "Province of the giants of the Indies", it was born as a result of the struggle of the Spanish conquerors with groups of indigenous inhabitants.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller races and competitions can also be seen here but at different times.
For news on fights and places to buy tickets for polo fights, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (PFK) which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound will be generally accepted wherever the island is located and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owner in advance to determine what payment methods are accepted.
Gold is impossible to exchange for Falklands currency inside the islands, so you must exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; during the dry season, temperatures over +30 °C are common.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to human sightings, the wildlife is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rangers, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all wild animals!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk, moose, deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of travelers fall and injure themselves by coming close to this huge, wild, and dangerous animal.
In addition, be careful because these scents can attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook food that smells strong and keep your surroundings clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.

During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of Tupua Tamasese's main leader Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbours.
The North Shore Coast (in the Northern Harbour District) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is almost entirely a sandy beach that is safe for swimming, and mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beach on Tamaki Drive is on Waitemata Harbour, an upmarket suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Auckland.
It is an often crowded family beach with many shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', this is not a complex beer, but it is tasty and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines are likely better to take on a trip.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is available if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards.
Many travel to the reef during this time of year, and injury from any cause on the reef is rare.

The box jellyfish spawned near the coast and near river mouths from October to April 1770.
Sharks are real, but they rarely attack humans.
Sea otters are not strongly ocean-dwelling, their main habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined airfare and hotel packages.
They can also hold your order for you if you need time to think about your offer or find other paperwork for your purpose (e.g. a visa).
Any additions or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees camp at the venue, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close you have to be more daring to take a campsite close to the music.
Please note that even though the music on the main stage has stopped, there will likely be some aspect of this exhibition that will continue to play until midnight.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If crossing the North Baltic during the wet season, check the cabin location, as crossing ice causes unpleasant noise for the affected area.
Saint Petersburg cruises include an overnight stay in the city.
Casinos typically make an effort to maximize the time and money spent by their guests.
Usually they have special food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guest's mood good, and make them feel at home.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, getting drunk is against common sense, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who must drive over high or mountainous terrain must be aware of snow, ice, or cold.
On slippery roads with lots of ice and snow, there is less friction and you cannot drive as well as if you were on unpaved asphalt.
When the snow melts, a few inches of snow is enough to trap you.
Your view may also be limited by falling or flying snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
However, icy and snowy conditions are common in many parts of the world, and traffic moves smoothly
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are a highlight for visitors.
The word safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to view the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, occasionally approach the vehicle and standard equipment can provide a spectacular view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with a trunk.
A safari on foot (also called a "bush walk", "hikari safari", or "footing") involves hiking, either for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March there were so many coronavirus-related cancellations that they were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that gold all-event tickets will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets priced at ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing booths available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If a hairdryer is not available, or if you do not like using a hairdryer, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage, or in certain cases, angus).
There are different ways to purify water, which of them is more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for just a minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters are diverse in their results, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a known manufacturer.
A traveler may enter a nest of an unfamiliar animal in a different area.
Mould can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the most severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people with their power, are not usually called vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the authorization to purchase goods that are exempt from duties and taxes in a particular place.
Travelers going on vacation to countries with high taxes can sometimes spend a lot, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.
The road layout between Point Marion and Fairmont reflects the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road, often through remote rural countryside.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep inclines, narrow country roads, and sharp turns abound.
The posted speed limits were significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections - generally 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and having to obey them implicitly was even more important than the others.
Strangely, in fact, even the cell phone service here is much stronger than along many other stretches of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bread is quite tasty, and in Batavia it is quite rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked for cakes all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance in summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but tasty cake, try one that depending on the region may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of water.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses many types of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term would imply that this dish is originally from eastern and central Java.
Now available in all parts of the archipelago, Javanese cuisine serves a wide variety of simple dishes, the preferred additions being nuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and other spices.
The sanggurdi is a frame for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the stance.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can be a concern as the rider's legs can still get trapped there.
If a rider falls from a horse but has one leg caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, all riders wear riding boots that have a hake and a soft, narrow sole.
Conversely, some stalls, particularly British stalls, have safety bars that allow the grape skins to fall from the stall if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - a major mountaineering site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large walls of granite and coral.
Climbers from all parts of the world continue to blaze new trails among the endless potential of its rim.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowshoeing, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered slope with ski equipment or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Traveling with skis: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, downhill skiing or downhill skiing.
It is related to but usually does not carry the style of alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is done on steep terrain and requires more rigid ski equipment and shoes.
Think of a ski trail as a similar climbing route.
In good conditions you will be able to travel longer distances than walking - but rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on well-maintained trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.
The Schengen Area, however, operates like any country with respect to this.
If you stay in these areas, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
In addition, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no commonly accepted definition for which manufactured items are antique.
The meaning has geographic variation, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft items can be called antiques, although they are relatively young compared to mass-produced items.
Cattle herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the customs surrounding the trade are also important for many who have other occupations.
Although traditionally not all Sámi engage in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they live from fishing, hunting, etc., with the reindeer being the main livestock.
Today many Sámi work in modern commerce.
Despite its widespread use, especially among people of other Romani backgrounds, the word "Gypsy" is often considered a pejorative because of its association with negative assumptions and inappropriate responses to Romani people.
If the country you are visiting follows travel advice, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may seek advice from the government rather than from yourself, but the government's advice is made to its own servants.
For example, Americans in the Middle East may face a different set of circumstances than Europeans and Arabs.
A report is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views often presented are often vague, general and very simplistic when compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Violent climate is a general term used to describe hazardous events with a high probability of causing significant damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hailstorms, torrential rains, and wildfires are forms and results of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and typhoons.
Seasonal and regional severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Refugees were warned to beware of adverse weather conditions.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should seek professional training.
An Internet search for 'hostile environment courses' may also provide the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover the topics discussed here in more detail, often with hands-on experience.
One course will generally last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Sex reassignment surgery plan Voyagers abroad must ensure they are carrying valid papers for their trip home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a gender not stated (X) or letters changed to match the name and desired gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor such letters also varies.
Searches at security checkpoints also became more explicit in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
A transgender person undergoing surgery should not pass the examination with their personality and dignity intact.
A strong current from the ocean that flows back toward the center when waves break on a coastline, often breaking on coral or other rocks.
Because of the underwater topology, the turbine blades are concentrated in some of the deeper parts, and fast currents to deep water can form there.
Many people have died from exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, but they could not.
Once you are out of the rivers, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skill and whether or not you ever get caught, you may want to wait for help.
