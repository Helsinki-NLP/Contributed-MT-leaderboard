Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already an established theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils in general can't.
Scientists describe the animal's plumage as pale or carotenoid-colored below and chestnut brown above.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft called a bird feather stalk but had other feather features, such as hooks and barbs, the researchers concluded that the bird feather stalk was probably a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and imaging.
Although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers claimed that it pointed to adult feathers, not a chick's, for example.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Milky Way galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter just like normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is made up of a large number of small particles, similar to a ring of light around the galaxy.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "extremely disturbing and frightening because of the very high mortality rate".
According to Dr. Moll, some of the patients may have been infected at the hospital, and at least two of them are hospital staff.
An infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 close contacts in a year.
However, the rate of XDR-TB in the entire population of people with TB is still low, with only 6,000 out of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

The government has also pledged millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine to help health agencies prepare for next year.
This year, plans to distribute vaccines to the historically worst-affected regions have been delayed due to lack of funding and low prioritization over other diseases.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters sit alone in a booth.
After the authorities verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law regulates the process quite strictly.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988 so that voters and observers can confirm at the beginning of voting that there are no envelopes in the ballot boxes and that no envelopes have been added to the boxes other than envelopes thrown in by voters deemed to be duly certified.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close observation following certain procedures.

Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the valley following the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinians agree to limit it to five years.
The hunters involved in the complementary insecticide spraying trial were planned to be closely supervised by the rangers while the trial was observed and its effectiveness assessed.
The NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc worked together to recruit qualified volunteers under the Sporting Hunting Association's hunting program.
According to Park Conservation Deputy Director Mick O'Flynn and NPWS Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to a new election.
Martelly responded with this commission to the massive anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
Failure to hold the necessary elections has led to sometimes violent protests, some of which have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that they were aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 new cases of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "really sad".
The earthquake occurred at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday) in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of any damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16.
While numerous hostages have been rescued, at least six people have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then posed as an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and joined the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in her spare time.
His research showed that if administered, the hormone would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager, Luna, died one night when she was two months old. Like her, she was quite unique. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even weirder...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election revealed that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term, Australia should have a republican treasurer.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic, while 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three flag events at the British Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't get the drugs he needed to ease his pain because they were banned from competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
In early February, many people confirmed this discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source that brings water to Earth, along with the organic material that makes up proteins and could support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political babble and stupidity".
There's speculation he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra services, no overground trains stopping at Wembley, no cars on the surface and no use of the park and ride facilities.
Fearing a lack of transportation, the match was likely to be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the appearance of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the species evolved in only two generations, whereas this process was believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape or form, rolled into small shapes.
It can be spun into thin wire that can be twisted, beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called tesserae.
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped from them, because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron.
Mix two tablespoons of dry powder, and then shape into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers to give you a fun sensation and form a kind of crust on your hand.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of baths where men and women mingled in mixed company.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite as a tool.
The satellite in space receives the call and bounces it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Because the Earth's atmosphere refracts some of our light and vision, scientists use telescopes in space.
To put a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet long.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including released domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three adult related males, along with about thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to wolf or dog prides, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not the full-throated roar of a lion but is much more like a grunting, shouting phrase.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Nearly all of the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find other animals for food by sensing and smelling where they are on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well at night and are also extremely stealthy.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) leaves the population from which they came (for example, if they go behind a mountain range or a river, or if they go to a new island from which it will not be easy to return), they will usually find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, meaning the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two animals will look too different to be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were packed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and it may have eaten its own kind.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
Although we are familiar with many of their foods, the Romans partook of strange or unusual delicacies, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the nutcracker.
Another difference was that poor people and women preferred to eat sitting on chairs, while rich men preferred to eat lying down.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and they had never tasted any ancient Roman turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a primary temple that was considered the house of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctum where only priests can enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the garden; the shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it's likely that informing is simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
Vichy was ruled by the French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly large group of people, a society, living and working together.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning 'civil'; it is also related to the Latin word civis, meaning 'citizen', and the Latin word civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', as well as describing the size of society.
Civilization culture refers to the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and its equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence of themselves and are not considered true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first established a weak central government under the Constitution of the Confederation, with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and because it had no executive or judicial branch at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state officials to enforce all of its acts.
Nor did it have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Changes to the Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states held the federal government in such contempt that its representatives were often not in office.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have some 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making Japan the seventh-largest island on earth!
Japan is often referred to geographically as a "group" because of the group of islands it possesses.
The turning point for Taiwan came in the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company revolutionized native grain production by building a plant in southwestern Taiwan and employing Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the facility have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common form of still image photography in the world is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still manufactured today, but more importantly, it gets most of its aspect ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
It's a little confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
This format is said to have an aspect ratio (the simplest integer is divided by twelve to find the ratio) hence 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS style family) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The overused and often quoted rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism in a photograph while maintaining proportion.
It states that the most effective area for the main subject is the point of convergence of the lines that divide the image into three, longitudinally and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the nations of Europe together despite their differences in language and tradition.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the most important tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's endowments are used specifically for that purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the Church had been in Rome, and the concentration of power and money there led many to question whether it was acting in accordance with that principle.
Immediately after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
Although this siege violates international law, which has been accepted as general law in many international treaties over the past two centuries, it has been strategically effective and has prevented the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolationism.
The nations that saw the horrors of World War I wanted to avoid a repetition of such suffering.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of China, or each ruling family, was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided territories between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce battles took place between the many nobles struggling for the throne.
During the period of the Three Kingdoms, one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, thousands died fighting for the highest position in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Again, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, ensuring that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same applies to the army because the army ranks are now based on Cailaber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired many members of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions as well.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life, and to immerse himself in thought, he often went to a cave on Mount Nur (Light), later called Hira.
The cave itself, which dates from that time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if it's known to exist.
Except for the clear, beautiful sky above us and the surrounding mountains, little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramids built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of Khufu's wives and family.
The upper bow mark looks like a V, and the "lower bow mark" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom.
This means that you have to push the bow from the top and pull it from the bottom, starting from the handle.
The upper string generally produces a softer sound, while the lower string is stronger and more precise.
Feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the matte bowstring markings are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to follow them.
The terrified King Louis XVI, his two young children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles, Queen Marie Antoinette, and the King's sister Madame Elizabeth were forcibly driven from Versailles to Paris by a large group of women on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a group of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war expenses incurred by US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the interest and expenses of the bonds held on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, the extra profits obtained from the long years of exploitation of the Filipino people are among the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to their creation.
The era in which the events take place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the time period of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-13000 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, when the settlement ended.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of ideas in practice. It literally includes views such as technological determinism, or the inevitability of technology, which holds that the fate of human beings is unconsciously determined by scientific laws and a logic associated with the application of those laws to technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "impacts" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, having a nationwide highway infrastructure is not economically feasible if the number of vehicles is low, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass car ownership also causes more accidents on the roads, which leads to new techniques in the health sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism was characterized by a broad cultural determinism through writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and culture related to that geography emerged, which were compatible with where the society was located and were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was seen as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
By about 400 C.E., it had acquired a reputation as a center of luxury that lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the twelfth century as the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
The title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris during these years.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and with the end of the Crusades, one of the great advances of the period was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming for the sole purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system using ecologically protected seeds specific to the region and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to achieve maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture express that they are part of that culture by using a distinctive and symbolic style, often involving fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point out several unfortunate incidents involving children who were socialized by neglect, unwillingness, or deliberate abuse by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been confined to enclosed spaces by humans (often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment of children in this way was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to live alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (as far as physical limits allow) almost entirely similar to that of the animal that raised him, such as fear of humans or insensitivity to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easy and engaging, mentoring goes a step further.
Guidance support is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Routing support can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a router but so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are for questioning, guiding and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing and loving and nurturing, but unfortunately, that's not the reality.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
We expect our foster care system to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Child welfare is obliged to meet all the needs that were not available in the previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet give it additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new incentives by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to Internet sites.
The exploitation of video images has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is suggested that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to tell whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in an article called The President's Speech, noted that people who have trouble perceiving speech correctly because of brain damage are still able to judge sincerity accurately.
In fact, he suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
In each generation, the separation and recombination mixes back and forth the variation between the two pools.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans' would struggle to meet its amino acid requirements from existing plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins from leaves and legumes, but plants are unlikely to be digested without cooking by primates like us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their protein problems in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (about 10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quieter alarm clock to simply clear your mind without completely waking you from your sleep.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, the clock may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed and forcing one to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the current life force is, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is within everyone's reach, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques taken from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through Yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga, in which the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures tore the countries apart.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would actually be fought for the next 40 years by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were shattered almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to protect your country's ability to move your people and your goods, but also to interfere with the enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, where the Americans were trying to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to bring aid to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have conquered England as well as the rest of Europe.
It is estimated that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and mail.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often led by goatherds who were children or adolescents similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
It wasn't until the 16th century that wagon roads were built in England.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Traverses were used to hold the rails in place at a fairly early date, but over time it was discovered that they could be more efficient with an iron strip on top of the rails.
This became a common practice, but caused more wear on the wooden wheels of iron wagons.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of iron were put into use.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means upright man.
The previous generation of Australopithecus could not walk normally on two legs.
Periods of bipedalism are seen in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally consciously, we can get involved in environmental movements, we can even become activists to reduce some of the problems of the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, problems made worse by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
After its adoption in Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies of what are now known as "Dunlap broadsides" were made in one night.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 to be read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The earliest copies of the document known to still exist are 25 Dunlap pamphlets.
Today, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
But there's still a lot about birds that looks like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of the values 0 and 1.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The most important sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the poison in question.
The term insect is used officially by entomologists for this species of insect.
The term is derived from their ancient resemblance to bed bugs, which have adapted to have a parasitic relationship with humans.
Both Killer Beetles and Bed Bugs are brood parasites that have adapted to live in their hosts' nests or homes.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to have children.
These couples may choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
In the process of adoption, the natural parents terminate their parental rights so that the child's family can be another couple.
The fundamental goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including the soul.
As Greek science declined, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and movement often depend significantly on the presence of internal cycles and the generation of these cycles by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-wheeling period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA with either a radioactive phosphorus phage or a radioactive sulfur protein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Mutations that occur only in germline cells can affect children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to work, passing other workers who are going to the same place they just left.
In these dynamic intermodal journeys, everyone is, in some way, connected to and supportive of a private car-based transport system.
Science shows that this massive carbon economy is upsetting the stable biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everybody is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everybody complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have an acceptable consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main properties have been established: (1) flow, (2) intensity, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
The first animals to fly were insects, and their ability to do so helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more easily with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back across their bodies.
This gives them a wider and smaller range of places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, at up to six miles wide, is also the largest river on earth.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of their structures.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked in awe at the monuments left by their predecessors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language spoken by most who work in the province, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since the earliest of times, people have had knowledge of basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be discovered in nature in their original forms and extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
In short, the pencil, when it first came out, was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil's uses and frequency declined.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to reach for a pencil sharpener.
Who knows what will happen to keyboard usage when something newer comes out?
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a sense, this process is like lifting a wheelbarrow up a hill, reusing the core and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can break apart with little or no intervention.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner below Maria, thicker in the highlands.
Because the crust is thinner, there could be more maria on the side, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what triggers or attracts people.
The theses in question reveal that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories deal with what causes some people to desire what they do and what causes their surroundings to cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In a general sense, two behaviors can occur as managers begin to dismiss and manage their former colleagues.
These types of managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team does and do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes conflicts between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the go-to person for their close physical group.
Virtual teams often have more autonomy than traditional team members because they can meet on shifting time frames that may not be understood by their local governments.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all possible resources in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation as well as promote knowledge sharing and in-house training.
Melek (2006) describes the Sustainability approach, a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of investigation and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is fueling scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesion, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is also allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material support to design simulation models that can help us unravel the workings of our mind.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and programming, responding to customer diagnoses and questions; handwriting, voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills became separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in home computers and video game software.
School trips are an important part of all classes. Teachers often love to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology provides the solution by offering a virtual tour, where students can explore the structures in a museum, visit an aquarium, or be enchanted by beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a school trip in a virtual environment is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trips to the State Capitol, the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online for use as a notebook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling mistakes, the presence of a readership often changes that.
Since the most critical audience is usually students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture followers' interests inspires students to be smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that opens doors to collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical; students can actively respond to Internet material to determine their position in the context of others' writings and their own viewpoints on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's charming bilingual capital, Ottawa, is home to many art galleries and museums that illustrate Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more underscores why Ontario is often described by outsiders as quintessentially Canadian.
Vast areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises most people: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the islands and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or dependencies of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it became very widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Every female traveler is advised to say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (not a ring that looks too expensive) can also help.
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no, and don't be afraid to say no (whether it's the right thing to do or not because of cultural differences).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was also used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was later renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts in the city.
If you want to shop in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products like tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and miscellaneous trinkets, but these are always for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered many of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Even if Goma is reasonably safe, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
With some of the cheapest trails in Africa for viewing mountain gorillas, the city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Goma you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its fame as a tourist attraction and its airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' most important stops on his PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as the air is more Arabian than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east and Zimbabwe in the north, with its southern border formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
As well as being one of South Africa's top attractions, it is also seen as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entrance fees for the park.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered by many visitors to be the main focal point.
The buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are likened to a glowing colonnade, which is further enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon shore.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been acquired from heavily reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took it for themselves, and so, if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the region, this is a good place to start.
Stretching some 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India, the Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest.
The Sundarban has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[1] The remaining part of the forest within the borders of India is called Sundarban National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is in wetland/swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and there are currently thought to be 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses leave from the inter-regional bus station (located across the river) throughout the day, but mostly between 06:30 and 07:30, especially to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the town of Siant-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 meters high and have two lanes 378 meters long and 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer tribe who lived in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá, and other indigenous tribes who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Land of the Giant Indians", is the result of a 16th-century encounter between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began three centuries of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous identity and character since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world and the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is set equal to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the islands' only bank in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and the US dollar are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on remote islands, but sterling and U.S. dollars may be used.
The Falkland Islands pound is almost impossible to change outside the islands, so change your money before you leave here.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and it's winter there when it's summer in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate, with summer temperatures often exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct seasons that can be described as rainy and "dry" seasons.
Although most of the animals in the park are familiar to humans, wildlife is still wild and animals should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance, and these animals are large, fierce and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid storing or cooking smelly food and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships belonging to Germany, the United States, and Great Britain paraded through the harbor, refusing to leave, thus earning the port its unfortunate reputation.
With the exception of one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the killing of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is situated between two harbours, there are many beaches. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and many have shade provided by the pohutukawa tree.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located between Waitemata Harbour, the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay, and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a wide variety of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a very complex beer but it's nice and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
Although there are plenty of French wines to drink, New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid of it, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of 'plain white' coffee is foreign to Australians. It is a short black espresso, the cappuccino comes topped with high cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard, the juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and thus injuries to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, check with local authorities, follow all posted signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near coasts and near estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770, although they can sometimes be seen outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives travelers peace of mind, knowing that when they arrive at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with certain hotels, but you can also choose other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) needed for your destination, they can hold your booking for you.
Any changes or requests must first be communicated to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp at the festival site, and most attendees see this as an important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you must go early to secure a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music has stopped on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, because walking through the ice makes a terrible noise for those who are sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Tourist ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
To keep the guests happy and satisfied, there are often specially prepared foods, drinks, and entertainment.
Some establishments may serve alcoholic beverages, but being intoxicated impairs judgment.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
In blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you stranded.
Visibility may also be restricted by snowfall, its type, condensation or icing on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic usually flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
The common use of the term safari refers to journeys made to observe striking African wildlife, especially in the savannahs.
A number of animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be closer to cars so that standard equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A safari on foot (also called a "wildlife walk", "wildlife walking safari", or "hiking") is a walk of several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some of the events being held at other locations across Japan.
Having hosted the games in 1964, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the summer Olympics twice.
If you have already booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
The vast majority of event tickets are expected to be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with average prices around ¥7,000.
Most hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed even if it is not in the room.
If you do not have an iron or do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Do not allow the fabric to overheat (this can cause pulling or in extreme cases even burning).
There are different ways of treating water, some more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several more minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you're concerned about this, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable brand.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in a worst-case scenario, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerably, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The land between Point Marlon and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote, backward areas.
If you are not used to driving in rural areas, beware of steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
Published speed limits are noticeably lower than the previous and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and a grudging obedience to them is more important than the opposite.
Strangely, cell phone signals are stronger here than other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is as rich and varied as in its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums popping up in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on where you are.
Curry is a dish containing meat or vegetables as well as dried herbs and spices.
Curry can be called "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
When referring to Indonesia, which has 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another qualifier, the term is used for food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Cava.
The main spices that are important to Cava are peanuts, hot peppers, sugar (especially Cava coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but may have safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse and gets a leg caught in the stirrup, the horse may run off and drag the rider.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, very narrow soles.
Some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety bars that allow a falling rider to pull back and allow the harness skin to fall off the saddle.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America for its high granite walls and sheer cliffs.
Peak climbing involves spectacular summit views, and mountaineers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes through endless climbing possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, also called "ski junkies", who plan their entire vacation to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is ancient - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
The history of alpine skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first sporting ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is somewhat similar to, but usually slightly different from, alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, which are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as an analogy for a hiking trail.
If the conditions are right, you'll be able to cover a lot more distance than you can on foot, but without groomed trails and a heavy backpack, you'll rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling to more than one country means going through many visa applications and passport controls.
In this sense, the Schengen area operates more or less like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of what manufactured objects are antiques.
The definition of antiquity varies by geography, as the age limit may be shorter in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be classified as antiques even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
Even if traditionally, not all Sami subsisted on large-scale reindeer herding, but on fishing, hunting, or similar occupations.
Today, many Lapps work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Lapland.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their own citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Recommendations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified when compared with more detailed information elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather conditions that can cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can be seen all over the Earth and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes are forms and effects of severe weather, just as strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are.
The type of regional and seasonal severe weather events also includes blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe turbulence affecting their destination, otherwise their travel plans may be adversely affected.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "enemy bypass" will probably turn up the address of a local company.
In a course, all the topics normally discussed here are covered in much greater detail, often through hands-on experience.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and involves acting, quite a lot of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about trying to survive in the wild are common, but there are few publications about overcoming war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documentation with them on the return trip.
The willingness of each government to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or renewed documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
Foreign governments' appetite for these documents varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative trans people should not expect to go through the scanners without having their privacy and dignity violated.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that often break on a reef or similar shore.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep parts, where a fast flow towards deep water can occur.
Most deaths result from fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, the difficulty of swimming back is no different than normal.
Try to aim where you won't get caught again, or depending on your skills or whether you're undetected, you may prefer to wait for help.
The re-entry shock kicks in earlier than culture shock, the honeymoon period is shorter, it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who quickly adapt to a new culture may later find it difficult to reestablish contact with their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you may have adjusted to a new culture and have lost some of your native habits.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not foresee the need to be patient and understanding with returning travelers.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them quietly before the show starts.
You hear the sound of tourists and vendors all the time, and the story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx has been identified as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Different countries have laid claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and the islands are home to the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
It is located in the archipelago, 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano has created a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is in the south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains join the plateau here, then resurface to form the 360 km (220 mi) long Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Mountains, contains Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with the summit being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not usually a substitute for cell phones, since you must be outdoors and in clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is frequently used by excursion boats and transport vessels, including explorers with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school leavers and allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Registering for a course abroad, often for a gap year, can actually increase your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
Usually, a tuition fee is charged for enrolling in these study programmes.
Finland is a great place for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, which are mostly seen in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You can't be in the archipelago and the lakes without a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a boat offer a different experience.
Boating is a traditional pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This matches up with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique.
Most authentic Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend several full days exploring the historic city, returning to the ship at night and sleeping.
As of 2009, you will also not need a visa if you only go ashore by boat.
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and travel to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and cultures, especially for those who have never flown before or have experienced a flight-related trauma.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and other dislikes that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Courier companies are paid large sums of money to deliver items on short notice. Time is often of the essence in the delivery of commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes the big companies have their own planes but other routes and small companies had problems.
If the items were sent by air freight, some routes may have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to fork over a fat wad of cash for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not economical at all. Roughly speaking, you can pay up to four times the normal fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines recognize that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a fortune for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The country's local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic heavily affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of approximately 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, İzmir is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, largely built around a bay and surrounded by mountains.
With its 18th-century market, historic mosques and churches, the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey, although wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centers are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views from the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat the camp with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and no jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't disrespect them by carving or writing on the walls.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understands this language, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is designated by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often a false stereotype, the best way to stay out of trouble in Paris is to behave respectfully, like a "bien élevé", which will make it much easier to stay out of trouble.
The tough exterior of the Parisians will quickly disappear when you show some basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is a heavily forested area with mostly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and reflects a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a fairly wide diversity of plants due to its microclimate diversity, different soils and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
In addition to many other common species, rare fauna can be found here, such as grizzly bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and cockerels.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer veils for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
These can be borrowed from the collection at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so feel free to wear these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, as in similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all dishes.
A popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli, which includes bread, olive oil, tomatoes, and easily available condiments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
With Sie meaning you, all nouns always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
The need to find out whether a verb or an adjective is used in the noun form makes writing a bit more complicated, but it probably also makes it easier to read.
Italian is easier than other languages because most words in Italian are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters to note are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Make sure you also pronounce the R and rr differently: "Caro" means lover, while "carro" means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and predominantly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and get a better grasp of expressions.
Needless to say, it will be easier to learn Portuguese if you know a language from the Latin family.
However, even those who know some Spanish may soon conclude that it is a language close enough to Spanish that it is not necessary to study Portuguese as well.
Premodern observatories today are generally outmoded and remain as museums or educational spaces.
In their heyday, when light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, they were often located in cities or on campuses that were easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the most popular flowers are plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor, and only he and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court could attend.
Plants look their best in a natural setting, so resist the temptation to take "just one".
If you're visiting an officially regulated garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out without discussion.
Since Singapore is generally extremely safe and very easy to get around, you can buy anything you want as soon as you arrive.
But in Singapore, located just a few degrees north of the equator in the "high tropics", you have to cope with both heat (always) and strong sunshine (rarely, when the weather is clear).
There are several buses to Al-Khalil, the traditional burial place of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives, the apostles mentioned in the Bible.
Make sure that the bus you're considering goes not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, but also to Al-Khalil.
Inland waterways are a good choice as the main theme of a holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, or travel by ferry to interesting cities on the Danube River or take a boat tour along the Erie Canal.

Christmas, one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many Christmas traditions have been adopted by unbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
It's a tradition to stay awake on Easter night in an open field to see the sunrise.
There are Christian accounts of this tradition, of course, but it's possible that it was a pre-Christian ritual symbolizing spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
The first animals to arrive on the islands all came by swimming, flying or gliding.
The distance to the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazer in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter months, you experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost every hour.
Since the regions are sparsely populated and thus light pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese business culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Standard business dress is a suit, and coworkers address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace harmony, which emphasizes group effort rather than celebrating individual accomplishments, is vital.
Workers often must obtain approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
