In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that researchers used it as a reference and compared it to three other treatments.
USA Gymnastics endorses the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and fully accepts the need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better served by continuing with the legal changes to our organization rather than revoking the license.
USA Gymnastics will support an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse on the scale described so eloquently by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long and will support any appropriate and appropriate changes.

Not only does it confirm that some dinosaurs must have had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it shows features that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists suggest that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other feather features - rays - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a modern dinosaur, the specimen represents the plumage of an adult creature, not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a modern dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chick down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was thought to be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in the form of at least a halo and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively lycopene-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very troubling and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll speculated that some patients may have contracted the bacteria in the hospital, and that two of them were health care workers.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the rate of XDR-TB in the entire TB-resistant population still appears to be low; in South Africa, it is 6,000 out of 330,000 people currently infected.

The disease is carried by pigs and then migrates to humans by ticks.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of anti-dandruff forks, and spraying pesticides.
The government has also pledged several million vials of a vaccine for meningitis, which will help health agencies prepare for the year ahead.
Plans to deliver vaccines to historically hard-hit areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funding and low priority given to them relative to other diseases.

Infrared images show that temperature variations between night and day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, based in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally takes place using advanced technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and tap a pre-printed sheet of paper to an envelope, marking their preferred candidate.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French marriage law codifies marriage procedure fairly closely.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can observe that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the ballot and that no envelopes are added except by duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to set procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists seem to walk a fine line if they publish photos of suspects etc".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that it will have no further comment until an indictment is filed.
The document, according to the leak, will address the conflict over borders that the Palestinians want back in line with those before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel maintained a permanent military presence in the valley for more than a decade after the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The arrows that participated in the extra pest control trial were to be closely supervised by guards as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the abandonment of the first CEP as part of a package of measures aimed at bringing the country closer to a new era.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Occasional Norwegian protests have been sparked by the failure to reschedule elections, which had been due to take place since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 appliance-related incidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The department responded by later calling the report by Apple "really regrettable".
The earthquake began in the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Philippine police officer holds three Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital in his spare time, Liggins began researching preterm births.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate the ripening of a baby's testicles.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes", on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. Luna was my first manager. Luna died on the night of her period. Ganc is exceptional, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe even crazier...she's gone and will be missed...I hope she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 Christmas campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the opposite extreme, 29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his form has been called into question by his complaints.
He was unable to take painkillers as they are banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and help sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, was elected governor earlier this year and last month signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to gossip as "political gibberish and nonsense".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year as well as curb carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no additional transport, no overground trains stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available above ground.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations, due to interbreeding between Darwin's endemic earthworm, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus earthworm, Geospiza conirostris, although this process was previously thought to take much longer.
Gold can be worked into various shapes; it can be rolled into small moulds.
It can be cut into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and can be glued to other metals; it can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make a pH indicator using blue cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in the markets will react with the outer layers for a pleasant sensation and form a shell-like structure.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space will pick up the signal and bounce it back to the dish almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to impress a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that will eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including house cats) that eat many more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, the extra job that each cat performs that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to three hundred females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as highly lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not perfectly), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars; these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar does not resemble the full voice of a lion's roar, but is more of a sentence made up of hoarse spoken words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small prey, preying on monkeys, squirrels, rodents, and birds when possible.
Scholars believe that ocelots follow animals and locate them (the victims) by scent; smelling on the ground where these animals have been.
They have very good night vision and are stealthy. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the surroundings and then attacking the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (e.g., if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it relocates to an island so that it cannot easily move back), it often ends up in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations than it did previously to be strongly competitive.
The original population as a whole is unchanged, still requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be spoken of as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means that new species arise; speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen you breathe and take in the carbon dioxide you exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses, and we use plants to make our clothes, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the best hunter of his time, afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set of teeth at the top of the jaw, which meant there was no chance of escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a dinosaur as large as T. rex couldn't have done it.
While most of their foods are known to us, the Romans also ate strange and unusual things during their festivals, including wild boar, rabbits, snails, and a type of rodent called a civet.
Another difference was that while poor people (as well as women) ate their food sitting on stools, rich men liked to have communal banquets where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman fires could not have contained products that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians had major temples for each of their gods, which were viewed as the god's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple plaza as well as an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Extra pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built to be part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the home was not as important.
Much of the life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women worked in the square, shops were just open stalls facing the street, and stone was used to build houses.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated; in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Wealth of Nations", you might think that the treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", with the text on the bottom of the document upside down.
It is not known for certain who wrote it, but early in its existence this large parchment document (29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that this inscription was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was controlled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together - a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also came to describe the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of a civilization involves the transmission of knowledge over many generations, the maintenance of a cultural trail, and significant ongoing development.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time established a weak central government - with Congress as its only element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to compel evidence, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, Congress relied on state governments, which were often unwilling to cooperate and enforce all of its acts.
It also lacked the power to repeal Prohibition laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, could only be amended twice, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with Germany, the world's second most successful national team and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan possesses a group of islands, it is often described geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in native grain production practices and also employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common motion picture format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but importantly, its proportions have eclipsed the image converter formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get a simple integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
Often abused and also often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple advice whose application creates dynamism while maintaining order in the image.
According to this, the most effective place for the main subject of the composition is the place at the intersection of the lines dividing the picture into vertical and horizontal thirds (see examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, also became an object of interest.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European countries despite differences in language and customs.
This pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money is specifically earmarked for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been followed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval bombardment of Germany.
This strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian lifelines, although the siege violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all shipping from affecting entire areas of ocean, posing a threat even to neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, the Germans expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, an attitude of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States at Thomas Edison's home with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his first job).
Ancient China had an unusual way of representing different periods; each period or ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There were also unstable eras of divided provinces between dynastic periods, the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were fierce wars between many lords fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died while fighting for supremacy in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing only the most ambitious and titled to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as instead of class-based military ranks, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane; he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
This cave, which has survived to the present day, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
It is located on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if it is known to exist; the interior of the cave is completely isolated.
We see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many mountains around us. Few things in this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V, and the "down bow" mark looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip and pull the string, and down means you should start at the frog (where your finger holds the string) and pull the string.
The upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while the downstroke produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
Feel free to add your own marks, but remember that printed string marks are there for the music and should usually be respected.
The beleaguered King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Thérèse and 4 year old Louis Charles), and the King's sister, Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women in the marketplace to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were howling and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved to the king the severed head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay dues to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
That the large profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would be a major source of revenue for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly described as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are conventionally dated to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from those that place technology first, technologically imperative, to the strict assumption that human destiny is driven by the logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development follows a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that the effects of technology's impact on societies are heritable rather than socially determined.
For example, one can say that the existence of cars leads to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership on a mass scale also leads to an increased incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques for treating injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, with associated customs and culture emerging over time, and these, being consistent with their place in society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
As a result, Paris was known as the capital of the modern world, and Constantinople as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance declined by the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders brought back goods such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
This was the moment when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of popularity of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing styles were heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the greatest achievements of this time, resulting from the Crusades, was the buttonhole.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using seeds native to a particular ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple yield maximization techniques.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers and this is still the case in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and vocabulary.
One of the simplest ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accidental or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during adolescence.
Some feral children have been captured by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, this rejection of the child has been accompanied by the parent's rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Homeless children may have experienced serious rape or traumatic experiences before being abandoned by their parents or running away from home.
Others may have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
In the case of being raised entirely without an animal, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that cared for it, such as its fear of humans or its indifference to them.
While project-based teaching is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the grading method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support for individuals as they move through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical; in other words, the principal is a form of scaffolding, much like the small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised into the software and is designed to ask questions, advise and clarify procedures that may be too difficult for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, to coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the surrogate fly system as a safe zone for these children.
Our surrogacy system is designed to provide safe homes, supportive caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The flyer is meant to provide any essentials that were missing from the child's previous home.
The Internet consists of elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to extra dimensions in the approach to use and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "long-term relationship" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to Internet sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, movements of the face lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is suggested that by properly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a given person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to a defective brain are nevertheless able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation expressed.
Segregation and recombination reverse the variation back and forth between the two domains with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate mammal with a vertebrate system such as humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, neglecting it has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, scavenging animals (ants, termites, eggs) are not only highly digestible, but also provide a large amount of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as modern savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you happen to move the clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, which causes you to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person is given is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force is present; every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment; the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but has expanded to include the Mahayana path of devotion as well as many techniques from Indian yoga.
In basic terms, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is stimulated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deities. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. As the war ended, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to a rift between the two nations.
Within two years of the war's end, some of the Allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest, without proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Red Army troops from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is actually the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your nation retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to ferry men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Cigars appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated guinea pigs were typically kept in herds that roamed the countryside or other pastures, often tended by guinea pig herders, often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herder.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Early seams were inserted to hold the tiles in place, but gradually it was realised that the tiles would be more efficient if iron filings were placed on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused a greater consumption of wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first all-iron gears were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning erect man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as habitually.
Bipedal specialisation occurs in the fossil record from 4.2-3.9 million years ago in Australopithecus, although the coelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is simply a symptomatic treatment; however, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of man.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, the original draft, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document took place on July 8 by John Nixon in Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have hoofs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a reliable diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine cabinet or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "flatworm" is used by entomologists as a formal designation for this group of insects.
This designation derives from their close relationship to bed bugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both insectivores and bed bugs live in nests and are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may feel that keeping the child is not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, biological fathers relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to learn about the way the world works through the scientific method, and this method, in fact, drives most scientific research.
This is not the same as experimentation, however, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to satisfy questions and make observations, and to conduct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific benefits.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a free-cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, which are viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by tagging either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material they affect, and whether the cells they affect are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscapes, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when the most benefit, there will always be more to gain in the short term, without acting selfishly.
Every morning, people drive out of small rural towns to their jobs and are passed by others whose jobs are in the area they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to and supportive of the private car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of the most stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the study of the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can otherwise be represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships between three main properties have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These departments assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air; their talent for flight helped them to avoid predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small areas in which to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are reptiles and amphibians.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, since you can't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers to the oceans.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza never equalled them in scale and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and least densely populated country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its canon law and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about the basic chemical elements - such as gold, silver, and copper - since antiquity, because they can all be found in nature in native form and are fairly easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, claimed that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it mentioned the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals; however, metals such as silver and gold also exist.
Alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the stylus was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the stylus was relegated to a lower status and less frequent use.
People now type messages on computer screens without needing to go near a keyboard.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer is introduced.
A fission bomb works by requiring energy to fuse a nucleus of protons and neutrons.
Memory is like rocking a heavy cart up a hill; splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to collapse with little or no compression.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust; the outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is narrower below the seas and wider below the highlands.
On the near side, there may be more marls because the crust is denser, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people source or speak to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want to do the things they do and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to manage their former coworkers: One end of the spectrum is an attempt to become "one of the dwarfs" (or children).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is the person who morphs into an unrecognizable individual who feels they have to change everything the group did and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams will often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams because their teams may meet in different time zones, which can be confusing to local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unusual component of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports; the invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization?
When all available resources are efficiently used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process in which an organization makes progress on overcoming a challenge may lead to a new, innovative process later on that meets the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be able to innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of study and making it more robust.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, changes, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes in a way never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling, and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from clients, and knowledge of market writing, voice, and creatives.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into several home computer and video game applications.
Field trips are an important part of every class, and quite often the headmaster wants to take his pupils to places where they cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips, where students can see museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
A virtual field trip is also a fun way to reflect on the field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing; while students often begin their blogging experiences with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually makes up for it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to seek to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to be smarter about the world around them". The need to capture an audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate consumption of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can articulate their position in the context of others' texts as well as draw their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant bilingual capital city and has many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and many more highlight that Ontario is considered to be quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is the only continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and known for luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was largely adopted in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influences and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Silk Road from Europe to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to find them being followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find squares selling mainly traditional Moroccan goods, such as jewelry, ceramics, leather goods, shisha, and a whole range of gadgets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo just east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city streets, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visitors outside Goma should be checked to understand the state of the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for one of the largest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma; the normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Coupled with its seeming inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although it has an airport and its canals have made it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates's PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts with the rest of the cities in the country as it has a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is regarded as the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for protection and park admission.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which grants admission to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider a major point of interest.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering soup chart, which is visible due to the presence of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
It is a place that the British colonists claimed as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is designated as Sundarbans National Park.
Forests include not only mangrove swamps but also some of the last stands of the vast jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is wetland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that the area now supports 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 white-tailed deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a day in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Poro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes of traffic 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, then called the "Great Province of India", was born from the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, which is in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to see which method of payment is acceptable.
Exchanging Falkland currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F) are common in the summer months.
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains more or less the same throughout the year.
While many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are wild and should not be handled or handled.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of hikers are injured because they didn't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or eating smelly food and keep the lager clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom were ordered to leave port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
There are many beaches along Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and are also provided with shade by the pohutukawa tree.
Almost all beaches are sandy, where it is safe to swim, and most provide shade from rip currents.
There are only sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the coast.
These are often busy family beaches with a good selection of seaside shops.
The main local beer is "Number One", not a complicated beer but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
Locally, tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if one is concerned.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign; a short black is an "espresso", and a cappuccino contains a large amount of cream (not foam), which is served without milk.
Abel Tasman National Park is in the Nelson Bays region of New Zealand's South Island, between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries from these causes alone on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, comply with any signs and heed safety warnings.
Jellyfish have been present near beaches and estuaries from October to April since at least 1770, and occasionally found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans; most sharks are afraid of humans and the tide.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance assures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be found that other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, can be booked through the travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even packages that combine flight and hotel.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be made at the tour desk and not directly at the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp out on the plaza, and most attendees consider this a legitimate part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to leave early to get a campsite close to the music.
Please note that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be some parts of the festival that will play until late at night.
Some festivals have extra targets for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing through the ice causes terrible alarm for those most affected.
Flights to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check condition).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests; windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have extra food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and entertained.
Some establishments offer alcoholic drinks on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to drive a car at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were driving on a bumpy asphalt.
During a blizzard, you can lose enough snow to freeze in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or drifting snow, or by condensation of water vapor or ice on vehicle windshields.
On the other hand, snow and ice roads are the norm in many countries, and road traffic is generally smooth year-round.
A safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in common usage refers to a journey overland to view spectacular African wildlife, particularly savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment will allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best viewed without binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or "hiking safari") involves walking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
People who booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the various rollbacks may find themselves in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover July 2020, which was scheduled for the Olympics.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry; many hotels have a drying rack and ironing board that can be borrowed even if they are not in the room.
If a curling iron is not available, or if you rarely wear curling irons, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Take care not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are various ways of storing water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for less than a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying water in a tightly sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter game pests that they do not find in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread iodine, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods exempt from duties and excise in specific locations.
Travelers going to high-tax countries can sometimes save a great deal of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, often passing through deforested forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use common sense: they carry steep gradients, narrow lanes and sharp corners.
The speed limits involved are markedly lower than on the first and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than on other occasions.
Interestingly, cell phone coverage alone is much better than many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are generally good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are popular, with apples ripening in the dough year-round, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts are also added to many German pastries, and popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you have a knack for small but rich cookies, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with the addition of meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term usually refers to spruce native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a relatively simple recipe, dominated by ground nuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the footrests of the rider that hang down the back on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can be dangerous because of the possibility of the rider's foot becoming trapped.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged behind him if the horse runs away; precautions can be taken to minimise this risk.
First, most riders wear riding boots with buckles and a slippery, rather thin sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety straps that allow the stirrup skin to fall off the saddle if the saddle is pulled up behind the falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley is a major climbing area in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and pinnacles.
With breathtaking views from the summit, climbers from all over the world painstakingly carve new routes through the infinite potential of the walls.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main travel destinations, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", plan entire vacations around skiing somewhere.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but not usually to the latter, which involves steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances in a stand-up than on foot - but very rarely will you be able to reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on paved routes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a trip through many countries would mean having to pass through visa procedures and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single state in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques; some rating agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
This definition varies geographically, the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Marketable products can be described as antiques, although they are more fashionable than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with the industry is also important to many people in other professions.
However, even traditionally not all Sámi people engaged in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, treating reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trades; tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region of the Sámi people.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate views of Roma.
If the country you are visiting is covered by travel advice, this may affect your health insurance coverage during the trip or your insurance coverage if you decide not to travel.
You can also use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for citizens of those countries.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
Press releases are only a brief summary of the political situation in a given country.
The views presented are often cursory, general, and oversimplified when compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather phenomena, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
It is recommended that travelers be aware of the risk of severe weather in their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone is required to undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment survival course" is likely to turn up the addresses of local businesses.
A course typically covers all the topics discussed in a much more detailed way, usually with hands-on experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid exercises, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should check that they have valid documentation for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undefined gender (X) or documents updated to reflect the name and gender applied for varies.
The willingness of other governments to honor these documents varies as well.
In the post-9/11 era, security screening has become much more invasive.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through the scanner with their privacy and personal dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return currents from waves breaking on a beach, often on a reef or similar area.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated at several deeper sections and can rapidly form a deep-water rapids there.
Most deaths result from drowning by attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the rapids, swimming back will be no more difficult than normal.
Try aiming for a place where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've already been caught, aim for a place where you can wait for the retaliation.
Return shock comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture often find it very difficult to adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adjusted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.

People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers who return home.
The sound and light room on the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the neighborhood for children.
You can see the pyramids in the distance and you can see them quietly before the show starts.
Usually only the sounds of tourists and sightseers are heard at all times, and the history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the background and narrator of the long narrative.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and other pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with Villa Las Estrellas.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains merge into the plateau itself and then out again to form the 225-mile (360 km) long Ellsworth Mountains chain, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, are Antarctica's highest mountains, Vinson Massif, whose summit is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outside in clear line of sight of the satellite to make a phone call.
They are often used by ships, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice transmission needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning a gap year is travel and education.
This is especially popular among school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before starting their studies, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Typically, tuition is required to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for skiing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and on lakes, you do not always need to have a yacht.
While offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This matches that of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can explore the historic town for several full days and return at night to sleep on the boat.
If you disembark using boarding passes only, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin as being in Germany; as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal attachments and aversions to other things that so many people have.
For some, an understanding of how a plane works and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or a lack of control over a situation.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering packages quickly, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent matter.
On some routes, the larger companies had their own fleet, but this was a problem on other routes and for smaller companies.
If they shipped goods by air freight, some routes could take several days to go through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get a faster pass was to check it in as checked baggage; airline rules do not allow baggage to be checked in without a passenger, and you almost show up on your own.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pretend to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it doesn't stop there: on the cheap, you can reasonably expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
It generally does not make sense either to seek discounts on business or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a narrow group of travelers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they bill accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations between the two parts of Moldova, economic contacts were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and has very good transportation links.
Below is the ancient city of Smyrna, now a modern, developed and bustling center of commerce, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, but the city has an atmosphere more Central European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard above some of the graves are interesting marble figures of doves.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling around this intriguing village.
To the north and within sight of the market is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous to outsiders after Lord Byron wrote of its splendour.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo do Roca.
To the north is the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are visiting the site of a mass grave, and a site of almost incalculable importance to much of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their stay in the square are still alive, as are many others whose relatives were murdered or imprisoned in the square, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this site with the dignity, respect and respect it deserves. Please do not make fun of the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish; about half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are given only in Catalan, as it is designated by law as the first official language.

Regular announcements in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unscheduled check-ins are distributed by an automated system in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as best you can as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered); this will make getting around much easier.
Nonsensical Parisian behavior will quickly disappear if you practice a few basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mostly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly high diversity of plant communities, due to a range of microclimates, different soils, and different altitude levels.

Rare species of fauna such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and lynx are present, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear slippers that cover their knees and have their arms covered.
Most monasteries will provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-length galoshes.
These can also be borrowed from the cloakroom at the entrance, but these garments are not washed after each wearer, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these slippers.
Majorcan cuisine, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in its preparation.
A simple popular meal, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any available spices such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
Some also find it easier to read, although writing is somewhat hampered by having to check whether a verb or adjective is being used in the noun form.
Pronunciation is quite good in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowel after them.

Persian has a fairly simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar glossary will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Needless to say, if you have some knowledge of Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those with some knowledge of Spanish may easily conclude that Portuguese is too close for them not to study it further.
Pre-modern observatories are now generally obsolete and remain as museums or places of education.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to cut out even "just one" specimen.
If you invade a formally organized colony, you will also be exterminated for collecting "specimens", no questions asked.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, if you are in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when skies are clear, less often).
There are also a number of buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish neighborhood of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for a ferry based on.
Examples include visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a boat trip to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also mark the routes of popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend the night at an exposed point on Easter to see the sunrise.
However, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often celebrate Christmas Eve on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin fireside chants at midnight to honor Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands arrived alone without swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Many mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos since the arrival of humans, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be more or less dark throughout the day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Anchovies are standard business attire, and co-workers address each other by their first name or by their surname.
Harmony in the workplace is key, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual accomplishments.
Employees often must obtain the approval of superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to follow their superiors' orders implicitly.
