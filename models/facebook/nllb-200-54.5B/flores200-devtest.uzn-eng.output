In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, which means the researchers used it as a baseline against which three other treatments were compared.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had hair - an already popular theory - but it also provides details, such as color and three-dimensional orientation, that fossils don't usually provide.
Scientists say the animal's upper feathers were a brownish-gray, while the underparts were white or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked the well-developed feather shaft known as the rachis, but had other features of feathers, such as whiskers and bristles, researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they may have been used for temperature control or navigation, rather than flight, and the researchers believe that while this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than juvenile plumage.
Researchers believe that although this juvenile dinosaur had a tail, the specimen reveals the feathers were not those of a chick, but of an adult species.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations in a bullet galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Milky Way.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in the form of a ring around the galaxy, made up of many, many small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, placing a pre-printed sheet of folded paper with their preferred candidate's name in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law codifies these processes much more rigidly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest to the absence of envelopes at the beginning and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following special rules.

He remains in custody pending indictment and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be misleading because his picture has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently, and the courts may view the publication of photographs as controversial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, noted that "when journalists publish photos of suspects and so on, they may be treading on very dangerous ground".
The Crown Office, which is part of the Crown Prosecution Service, told reporters there would be no further comment, at least until the indictment.
According to you, the document refers to a border conflict that the Palestinians want, based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
It is said to encompass the future Jerusalem, a holy site for both communities, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on maintaining permanent troops in the valley for a decade after the treaty is signed, while the PA agrees to keep such troops for only five years.
Because the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed, shooters in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by guards.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sports Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited to work on the SSA's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park protection and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for initial firing practice underwent extensive safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a series of measures designed to steer the country toward new elections.
Martelli responded to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October with a commission.
In some cases, the violent protests were triggered by the cancellation of elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
Nearly 60 incidents of faulty iPod devices overheating have been reported, causing six fires and four minor burns in total.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported 27 cases involving the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which Apple described as "not serious".
He called Apple's delay in releasing the report "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no immediate reports of any damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacks a bus of Hong Kong tourists in Manila, Philippines, and holds them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino artists.
Because the old lady needed to use the bathroom, the painters later took over.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm births in her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone is released, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
According to Xinhua, government investigators on Wednesday recovered two black box devices that recorded technical details of the flight.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. Luna was my first manager. Luna died on a night that was as rare as two months. Little woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as excited as I was...maybe more than I was...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic following the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents said the same, with 34 percent wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The most striking results of the poll were that 29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but her health has been called into question due to her complaints.
He couldn't get the pain medication he needed because it was banned from the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
In early February, multiple people using different hardware and software confirmed the discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that could have formed proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, because comets have collided with the Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.
He describes the rumors as "political claptrap and nonsense".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims NextGen is a system that will allow planes to fly short distances and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses sputnik-based technology, unlike older radar technology, to provide air traffic controllers with better detection of planes and more accurate guidance to pilots.
There are no trains stopping at Wembley, and there are no car parks or parking facilities.
Fear of lack of transportation made it more likely that the game would be played behind closed doors, without fans.
Thursday's edition of the journal Science reports the discovery of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer due to crossbreeding between Geospiza fortes, an endemic Darwin's finch, and Geospiza conirostris, an immigrant cactus finch.
Gold can be made into any kind of shape, you can make it very small.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and rolled, beaten with a hammer, or rolled into sheets.
It can be cut very thin and pasted onto another piece of metal, and it can be made so thin that it was used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations in so-called illuminated manuscripts.
That chemical is called pH, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The level of pH (potential hydrogen) is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions in the test chemical (pH is hydrogen H in potential hydrogen).
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
It feels weird when the moisture from your hand reacts with the outer layers to form a crust.
Almost every home in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan dwellings on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets, and in the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed-gender public baths.
When you make a call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then returns it almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere blocks some of the light and distorts our view.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space would require a huge rocket more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in profound ways. The biggest benefit the wheel has given us is that it has given us an easier and faster means of transportation.
This has brought us trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
These are medium-sized cats that eat prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And of course, there are many smaller felines (including house cats) that eat smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the sense of place, a special skill each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are highly social cats that live in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males, up to thirty females, and cubs.
Urgho are usually sisters or daughters from an extended family, closely related to each other.
Packs of lions behave much like packs of wolves or dogs, and the animals (but not other big cats) are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions and also deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb (not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a human.
Tigers are in the same family as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera), and these four are the only cats that can sing.
A tiger's roar isn't like a full-throated lion's roar, it's more like a series of grunts and growls.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they get the chance, and almost all of their prey are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey by sniffing out where animals are walking.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark, but they also move silently, so when they're hunting their prey, ocelots adapt to their environment, and then they chase and capture their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island where they cannot easily reproduce), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so they require different traits or adaptations to be more competitive for the new population than previously required.
The indigenous population hasn't changed much, and they still need to adapt as much as before.
Over time, as a population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process, called speciation, simply means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, no species can survive.
Tigers were the most fearsome predators of their time, so he feared nothing more than other tigers.
It has more than 70 sharp teeth in its long jaws, plus an extra set in the upper part of its mouth, which means it can't run away from anything that gets in its way.
We're not sure, but it probably had an isolated language, ate a diet of turtles, large fish, and other reptiles, and may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex couldn't keep up with it.
While many of their dishes are familiar to us today, they had none of the strange or unusual elements of Roman banquets, including pigs, rabbits, chili peppers, and the rodent species known as catfish.
Another difference was that the rich had banquets where the poor people and the woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, and she preferred to recline while they ate.
The food of ancient Rome does not include the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they never ate corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians had a central temple for each of their deities, which they viewed as a separate house of worship.
Sacrifices were made to the gods, and the priests attended to the needs of the deities by performing rituals and holding festivals.
Each synagogue had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped minarets, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
At the top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the deities.
In the warmer climates of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
For most of their lives, the Hebrew family lived under the open sky.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, and wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated, and in Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he encountered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But the land was already inhabited by the Inuit at that time.
Although all of these countries are "Scandinavian countries", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had many differences in people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
It's not a treasure map, despite what it says on the back of the document.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", which can be seen upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, a large parchment document measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches was wrapped for storage.
So this entry was probably just added as a label.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than fight the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a large group of people living and working together, sharing a common culture.
The word civilization is related to the Latin civis, meaning civil, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some cases indicating the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of countries, and civilization cultures are about the intergenerational transmission of knowledge, the long-lasting traces of culture, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Smaller cultures often disappear without any historical evidence of their existence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, of which Congress was a part.
Because Congress lacked the power to tax and had no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on largely uncooperative state agencies to enforce all legislation.
It also did not have the power to override tax laws or tariffs between states.
Amendments to the Articles required unanimous consent of all the states, and the states accepted the federal government so lightly that they often lost representation.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the Olympic Games and international games.
Japan (the largest of which is Honshu) has nearly 7,000 islands, making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", geographically speaking, due to its cluster of islands.
Taiwan's beginnings can be traced back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began a transformation in local grain production practices, recruiting Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Chinese government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of Three Mirrors.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better sense of how they originally came to be.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's widest film format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing because it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) have aspect ratios equal to or very close to this.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating fluidity while maintaining a sense of proportion in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that bisect the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown in wealth and power, faced intense scrutiny.
The Christian faith had bound the nations of Europe together for thousands of years, despite differences in language and tradition.
Its far-reaching power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth is necessary to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties of the past two centuries, the strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supply lines.
The British mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering all parts of the ocean, threatening even neutral shipping.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing mood among many citizens and nationalities was pacifism and isolationism.
Having lived through the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such things in the future.
In 1884, Tesla immigrated to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former business manager, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of China, or each ruling family, belonged to a specific dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of unstable but prosperous provinces, most famously the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted about 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty.
During this time, there were violent clashes between rival nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne in a magnificent palace located in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, including the adoption of the metric system, the move from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to individual rulers.
It was also after the Revolution that professions became open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to flourish.
This applied to the military as well, because rankings in the army were now based on caliber, not grade.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this world, and he would go to a cave on the mountain of light known as Hira to meditate.
The cave itself, which has remained intact throughout the ages, provides a vivid illustration of Muhammad's psychological tendencies.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows it's there, it's not easy to find.
You can see nothing but a clear blue sky above and many mountains around. Inside the cave, you can see or hear a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, or "Giza Necropolis", contains several pyramids, the largest of which is the Great Pyramid, several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
The "up arrow" looks like a V, and the "down arrow" looks like a square or a cube with the bottom side down.
Up means you start at the tip and you have to pull the rope, and down means you start at the arrow and you have to pull the rope.
The upper string usually produces a softer sound, while the lower string produces a louder, more aggressive sound.
Feel free to draw your characters in pencil, but remember that the bow characters are written for musical purposes, so they often have to be taken into account.
The horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and four-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced from Versailles to Paris by a mob of women vendors on October 6, 1789.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and chanting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of the executed royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
U.S. imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people.
To cover the bulk of the costs, as well as the interest on the bonds placed by the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government, they were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the enormous profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people constitute a major source of revenue for US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it's important to understand the environment that led to their creation.
The time period is the 11th , 12th , and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) of European history , collectively known as the High Middle Ages .
After the High Middle Ages comes the Early Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages, which ends, conditionally, around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological drive, or technological necessity, to the rigorous notion that human destiny is governed by underlying logic related to scientific laws and their reflection in technology.
Most descriptions of technological determinism embody two general ideas: that technological development itself largely occurs outside of political or cultural influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are not socially determined but rather specific.
For example, a motorized car can lead to a corresponding improvement of the roads.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new methods of manufacturing have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership has also led to an increase in traffic accidents, which in turn has led to the development of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism also had a large element of cultural determinism, inherited from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
The Romantic view was that geography shaped individuals, and that over time, the customs and culture associated with that geography were better suited to their place in society than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its rise to prominence as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, largely because the Slavs returned with more gifts, such as silk and spices, than the Byzantine market could offer.
It was also around this time that the capital of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
But because of the slowness of communication channels, Western methods are probably 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style, and one of the great developments that came out of the Enlightenment was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
A subsistence farm is one that produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines crop rotation with the use of seeds preserved in the ecological niche or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures connect like-minded individuals who feel disempowered by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The defining qualities of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through idiosyncratic and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, behaviors, and jargon.
Citing a small number of unfortunate examples of children who were not socialized by adults as adults, whether through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, is a common way to show the importance of socialization.
These children are referred to as feral or feral.Some feral children are restrained by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, abandonment occurs when parents turn away a child with a severe mental or physical disability.
Vulnerable children are more likely to have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild.
When raised by creatures that are not fully human, a child predator will almost exclusively exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of the animal it is caring for, such as fear or indifference to humans.
When project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, support extends beyond borders.
It's not a training tool, it's a way to help people get through a new experience, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Pools can be both virtual and real, so in other words, the teacher is a pool shape, but so is the little humanoid paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are built into the software, and they're designed to ask questions, help, explain processes that a student might find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up without discipline, nurturing and learning, but they do.
We think of the foster care system as a safe space for these children.
Our guardianship system needs to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide them with all the essentials that may not be available in the home where they were removed.
The Internet incorporates elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special properties of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of usability and desirability.
For example, "education" and "socialization" have been proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In a study of audience interaction on websites, "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified by Eymey and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial expressions that last for several millennia.
In particular, the claim is that by correctly interpreting small expressions, you can tell whether or not someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in an article called "The President's Speech", showed how people who have difficulty understanding speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even speculated that similar abilities to interpret human behavior might have been acquired by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century suggested that there were two reservoirs of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of accelerated variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two currencies with each generation.
Outside of the savannah, for a primate with a digestive system like ours, it's difficult to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
And failure to do so can lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would be the easiest plant sources to grow, but they're hard for primates like us to digest without cooking.
In contrast, existential foods - ants, termites, eggs - are not only easily digested, but they also provide high levels of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to modern savannah chimpanzees.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up from your normal sleep schedule and falling asleep after a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
An easy way to do this is to use a quieter alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you turn the clock off when you sleep, you can put it in a different corner of the room so you don't have to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calmness a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of physical and psychological distress a person has.
The lower the intensity, the more positive the life force, the more each person has access to complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tendency to be nervous and negative.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many styles of Indian yoga.
In fact, Tibetan Buddhism is so profound that it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through the use of yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, where visualizing various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates an enlightened mind.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the war, the system, the process of development, and the clash of cultures brought countries into conflict with each other.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought on real battlefields by proxy armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many more.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral treaties, moving into Belarus and Ukraine and establishing fronts.
Using ships to transport products is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and products across oceans.
The Navy's job, traditionally, has been to maintain your nation's ability to move people and goods, while hampering your opponent's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to support British operations.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies hadn't won, Germany could have invaded Britain, along with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pastures, often by the better-known shepherd-like goatherds, who were often children or teenagers.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed packhorses to reach greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the somewhat bumpy roads of the day.
Railway sleepers were very early inventions, but they slowly realized that railroads were more useful if they had iron on them.
This was a common practice, but it led to more wear on the wooden wheels of the rail cars.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced the wooden wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were made.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means upright man.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago, specialization in bipedal locomotion has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
It often feels like symptomatic treatment, but if we want only a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It's common knowledge that the world has undergone tremendous changes due to human scientific and technological advances, and that the problems caused by overpopulation and humanity's wasteful lifestyles are only getting worse.
After it passed Congress on July 4, the manuscript, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now called "Danlep Side Lilies".
On July 8, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, the document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
Of the 25 Dunlap posters still known to exist, this is the earliest surviving copy of the document; the original manuscript has not survived.
Today, most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, which we call birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot that's like dinosaurs with birds.
They have fur and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on binary coding for information manipulation.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called bits, or binary numbers, for use in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as withdrawal are common and may not be immediately diagnosed.
An open container of pharmaceuticals or toxic household chemicals is a good example of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term fungus is officially used by ethnologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with bloodsuckers, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are predators that have adapted to live in burrows or in the homes of their owners.
With an estimated 400,000 diagnosed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, it remains the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve fibers.
The study found that women were twice as likely to have an MS degree.
A couple might decide that it's not in their best interest or their children's best interest to have children.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their children.
With adoption, parents terminate their parental rights, after which another couple can assume parental responsibility for the child.
The whole point of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method, which actually leads to many other kinds of scientific inquiry.
But it's not just about experiments, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, problem statements, and observations that also serve as guidelines for research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, in particular the Gospels in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are generally accepted.
With the decline of learning in Greece, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles that are regulated by biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external rhythmic signals, have been documented in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an autogenerator that keeps cycling autonomously even in the absence of external cues.
That DNA is the genetic material was one of the central assumptions of the Hershey-Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether or not the affected cells are germ cells.
Mutations in germ cells can only be passed on to offspring, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy nature, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting Borneo to photograph and study orangutans.
Every morning, as people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, they cross paths with people who have jobs in the places they just left.
On this dynamic transportation corridor, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of a transportation system based on private cars.
Science is now showing that this large carbon economy robbed the biosphere of one of its stable states that had supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everybody is a participant in society and everybody uses transportation systems.
In the developed world, you rarely hear complaints like that about the quality of the water or the broken bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they make mistakes every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something more important?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is not 100 percent predictable.
Well, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; so traffic flows have a somewhat reasonable consistency and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent turbulent flow, the following relationships were established between three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air, and their ability to fly made them better at avoiding predators and finding food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings across their bodies.
This gives them a much larger small area to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and midges.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think it's true, but many believe the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and possibly other stars) revolves around the Earth.
Which is convenient, because the ground doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed by the pyramids of Giza in terms of their size and technical advantages in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the sculptures of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest sovereign state and the least densely populated country in the world.
In Vatican City, Italian is the language of legislation and official communication.
While Latin was commonly used in religious ceremonies, Italian was the everyday language used by most people working in government.
Almost everyone in Vatican City is Catholic.
Since all of these occur naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with tools, people have known about basic elements like gold, silver and copper since prehistoric times.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things were made of one or more combinations of four elements, which he called earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter, in that order: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they could change into new substances to form the things we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals - remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Matter makes up everything in the universe, and tiny particles called atoms make up matter.
Atoms are so small, trillions of atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was first invented, it was a great companion for many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil fell into disrepute and declined in use as new writing techniques emerged.
People are typing on computer screens now, they don't even have to go near the pen.
You can only imagine what the keyboard will look like when something newer is built.
A fission bomb works by expending energy to assemble a nucleus made of many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy cart up a hill, and when the nucleus splits, some of that energy is released again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, with the outermost layer called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 kilometers on the side of the Moon that we can see from Earth, and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the Moon Sea and thicker in the highlands.
There's probably more magma closer in, because the crust is thinner, and it's easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or engages people.
These theories suggest that by the time people enter adulthood, they have certain innate needs and/or desires.
These theories look at what makes certain people do what they want to do and what factors in the environment influence whether or not they do certain things.
Two popular theories of intrinsic motivation are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Gersberg's two factor theory.
In general, when managers start to exert authority over former colleagues, there are two types of behaviors that can occur, and one end of the spectrum is trying to be "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a single individual becomes an unrecognizable presence who feels the need to change everything the community has ever done and make it their own.
And in the end, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this kind of behavior is a source of friction between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards of excellence as physical teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual groups often act as focal points for their physical groups.
Because their communities can meet in different time zones, which local governance systems may not understand, they often have more autonomy than traditional communities.
The presence of a real "invisible community" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p. 109) is also a component of a virtual community.
The Invisible Team is a management team where each member is accountable, and the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an educational organization want to go through a process that takes a long time to set up?
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all the resources available in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively.
As a result, an organizational process that works together to overcome a barrier can trigger new innovative processes that serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the context approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the field of study and making it more specific.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supported in the research of these scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and function of the brain in a way that has never been possible before.
This provides a lot of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While AI has a strong science fiction component, AI is also a very important area of computer science that deals with behavior, machine learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research focuses on building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
These include the ability to monitor, plan, and schedule; respond to client diagnoses and questions; and recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
These kinds of solutions to real-life problems have become separate disciplines.
AI is now being incorporated into a number of home computer and video game applications, as well as being used extensively in business, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any lesson, and a lot of times the teacher wants to take their students to places where they can't travel by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual field trips where students can sit in their classrooms and admire artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art.
Sharing virtual field trips is a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, a student at the Bennett School in North Carolina creates an annual website about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills.Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience can often change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, to avoid criticism, the blogger tends to improve what he writes.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".The need to satisfy public curiosity inspires students to be informed and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to inspire collaboration and motivate students to expand their knowledge beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "allows students to become better analytical and critical thinkers; by actively responding to online material, students can position themselves within the context of others' posts, as well as express their own point of view on specific issues". (Oravek, 2002)
Ottawa is the glamorous, bilingual capital of Canada, with an array of art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka and beyond, untouched natural beauty.
All of this and more underscores how Ontario is perceived by foreigners as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and in some places almost desert.
As a population comparison, it may come as a surprise to many that there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean along the eastern coast of the African continent.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and most unique continent.
Many of the smaller islands are associated with independent countries or France and are popular as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which became prominent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
With the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female tourists, regardless of marital status, are advised to disclose that they are married.
Wearing a ring is also useful (although it doesn't look very expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and that following and holding hands are not uncommon.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Barbary fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products like crowns, pottery, leather goods, rugs, and ornaments, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which reduced the streets, especially in the city center, to ashes.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be researched to understand the context of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for gorilla trekking and climbing Nyiragongo, the most affordable mountain in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.The typical (local) price for short trips is ~500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative lack of accessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for faraway, exotic places.
Today, Timbuktu is still a poor town, despite its grandeur and the airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger of desertification.
This was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Geist's PBS special series "Wonders of the African World".
It's very different from other cities in the country because it's more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Scientists are working to create reactors that can generate energy in a similar way.
It can be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card that gives access to select South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major attraction for many travelers.
The line of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong is like a brightly barred table, clearly visible due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon Beach on the opposite side.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on developed land along the northern coast.
This is the land the British colonists claimed as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sandarban is the world's largest coastal mangrove swamp, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain the last remnants of the mighty rainforest that once covered the plains of Hindang.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sunderbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and the area is currently estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 mountain deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially to the east and Jakarta/Bumtang.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by Japan's comfortable and durable cabotage buses.
Companion taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Ayapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Ayapock River, connecting the cities of Ayapock, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-Ayapock, French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, it has two aisles with a length of 378 meters and a width of 3.5 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, while the construction of Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsisting on subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indians", Paraguay was formed in the 16th century as a result of a conflict between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the polo stadiums in Las Ca√±itas host the biggest tournament of the year.
At other times of the year, you can also see smaller competitions and matches.
For information on where to buy tickets for polo matches and updates on tournaments, contact the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to one British pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located across the street from FIC West in Stanley.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are also widely accepted.
While British or US currency is acceptable, credit cards may not be accepted on the outlying islands; check with the owners beforehand to see what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is situated in the subtropics; temperatures of over 30¬∞C are not uncommon in summer.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it seem colder than the thermometer actually reads.
There are no distinct rainy and dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park recommends that you stay at least 100 yards away from bears and tigers and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Bison, elk, moose, bear, and just about any large animal, no matter how tame they may seem, have the ability to attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals can be huge, wild, and dangerous, so give them their space.
Scented candles also attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking scented foods and keep campgrounds clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It's on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a dramatic naval clash when seven ships from Germany, the U.S., and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland straddles two harbours, it has a large number of beaches, the most popular of which are spread across three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost entirely sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and often shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a row of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There's a lot of French wine to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better on the road.
Homemade tap water is perfectly safe, but if you're scared, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of a flat white coffee is foreign to Australians. An espresso is called a black roast, a cappuccino can be filled with cream (but not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is legal in Belgium, but fruit juice is a little more expensive.
Most trips to the reef are made year-round, and the reef has a low incidence of injury from any of these causes.
If so, follow the advice of government agencies, follow all signs, and heed all safety warnings.
The box jellyfish has been found north of the coast near the confluence of rivers and streams from October to April since the 1770s, and occasionally at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance also ensures that there will be a place to stay when arriving at the destination, giving the traveler peace of mind.
Although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency, travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even flight and hotel services.
They can also book it for you if you need time to present or obtain other documents for your destination, such as a visa.
All changes and enquiries must be made through the travel agent first, not directly to the hotels.
For some festivals, a large portion of music festival attendees decide to camp in the area, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Please note that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until midnight.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in the winter, consider the location of the cabin, because walking across the ice creates a terrible noise that can affect some people.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Participants in the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests; there are often no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They often offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to lift guests' spirits and keep them indoors.
Some venues will serve alcohol on the premises, but intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying alert.
Anyone attempting to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes must take into account snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't move as much as on regular asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by snow or hail, or by condensation or ice on windshields.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in most countries, and traffic flows almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and a major draw for many visitors.
The familiar term safari refers to an overland journey to view Africa's amazing wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and standard equipment offers a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better through binoculars.
A "hiking trip" (also called a "bushwalk", "hiking trip", or "hiking") is a walking tour that lasts several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
As Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, it is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and hotel for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a tough spot.
Cancellation procedures vary, but the cancellation procedure based on the coronavirus at the end of March will not continue until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with regular tickets priced around ¬•7,000.
Ironing clothes helps them dry, and many hotels will rent you an iron and ironing board even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many different ways to treat water, some of which are highly effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, it only takes a minute for water to boil, while in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you're worried, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that are unknown in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Dangerous animals that are infectious, either by themselves or by force, and can injure or kill humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain areas.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can save a lot of money in some cases, especially on things like alcohol and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the worst driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, with often-desolate terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be aware that there are steep inclines, narrow tracks, and steep drops.
The speed limits in this section are significantly lower than the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and are more strictly enforced than the others.
And what's interesting is that cell phone coverage here is much stronger than most other destinations, like Pennsylvania Wild.
German pastries are particularly good, and Bavaria, like its southern neighbor Austria, is much richer and more varied.
Fruit cakes are popular, and apple pies are available year-round, while cherries and plums are available throughout the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.Popular baked goods often go especially well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you prefer small cakes with milk, sugar, and fat, try a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a meat or vegetable-based dish with herbs and spices.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is common.
Indonesian cuisine, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of local dishes found throughout the country.
However, the term without further qualification actually tends to refer to a dish originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now common throughout the archipelago, consists of simple spiced dishes, with the main spices favored by Javanese people being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
And upon the panels that were between the fillets were shoulder-pieces joined together.
They provide the rider with a more secure grip, but can also be a safety concern due to the risk of the rider's legs getting caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse and the leg gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may be dragged if the rider runs away, and there are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, well-fitted, narrow sole.
Also, some saddles, notably the English saddle, have a safety harness that allows the long fur to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its massive walls and cliffs of various granites.
Peaks offer spectacular views from the highest points, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through the endless possibilities of its walls.
Alpine skiing, which combines skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing or snowboarding on snow-covered terrain.
Ski flying is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski daddies", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular destination.
The idea of skiing is incredibly old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Ski flying has been known as a sport since at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was established in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski mountaineering: Also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is usually associated with, but not limited to, alpine style skiing, or ski mountaineering, which is performed on steep slopes and requires hard skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
When the conditions are right, you can cover more distance than you can on foot, but only rarely can you be fast on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent states.Typically, traveling across multiple countries means applying for visas and going through passport control multiple times.
But in this respect, the Schengen Area works more like a single country.
Once you're in the area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There's no perfect way to tell which manufactured items are antiques, and some tax agencies classify items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
There are geographical differences in the definition where the age limit may be lower than in Europe, such as in North America.
Handcrafted products can be described as ancient, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Rearing reindeer is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Saami engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but made a living by fishing, hunting, or similar activities, often keeping reindeer as livestock.
Tourism is an important source of income in S√°pmi in the S√°mi region.

If there are travel warnings in the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation.
You may also want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is for their own citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may experience a different set of circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Official advisories provide a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic relative to the details available elsewhere.
Severe weather is an umbrella term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, storms, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include heavy snowfall, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of extreme weather hazards affecting their area, as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A web search for "war room course" will likely return the address of a local company.
A course typically goes into a lot more detail about what's been discussed here, often with hands-on experience.
The course typically lasts two to five days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on desert survival are plentiful, but few on war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid travel documents for their return trip.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without (X) gender, or updated documents with the correct name and gender.
Equally volatile is the willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents.
In the post-9/11 era, security checkpoint searches were even more unpleasant.
Transgender people undergoing surgery should not expect to go through the scans without privacy and confidentiality concerns.
Rip currents are currents that come back from waves that often break on the shore at reefs or similar places.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow collects in a few deeper pockets, where it creates a fast current in the deeper water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against an impossible current.
Once you're out of the flow, swimming back isn't any harder than normal.
You can aim for the unreachable, or, depending on your skills and exposure, you can wait to be rescued.
The re-entry shock comes sooner (but less often than the honeymoon), lasts longer, and can be more severe than the culture shock.
Tourists who are slow to adapt to a new culture often have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you're adapting to a new culture and losing some of the habits of your local culture.
When you travel abroad for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding as they learn that tourists need to adapt to a new country.
What people may not know is that patience and understanding are also necessary for tourists returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the area's most popular attractions for children.
You can watch the pyramids in the dark and see them quietly before the show starts.

Scenes were projected onto the pyramids, and different pyramids were lit up.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by several countries, and it has the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Lingwiston Island and Deception, the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano, which provides a fine natural harbour.
The Land of Elserta is a region in the south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains merged into the plateau, then re-emerged to form the 225-mile-long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica, with Vinson Peak at 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
Satellite phones don't replace cell phones at all, because you can't make a phone call unless you're out in the open with a clear view of the satellite.
The service is used by shipping companies that require long-distance and voice messaging, including cruise ships.
Your local phone service provider can provide more information on how to connect this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning academic vacations.
This is especially popular with high school seniors, as it allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into a top university in your home country.
Enrollment in these programs typically requires a tuition fee.
There are thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos of the Land of a Thousand Lakes.
You don't need a yacht in an archipelago or on a lake.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually big enough for a yacht, a smaller boat or ship offers a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is true in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is peculiar elsewhere (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic town for a few days and return at night to sleep on the boat.
If you only go ashore using boat tours, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Several cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they've never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not a matter of personal dislike or fear of other things that too many people might have.
For some, figuring out a few things about how the plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear of the unknown, of being in control or not.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver items quickly.Usually, time is of the essence with business documents, goods, or spare parts for a quick repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller firms.
If the goods are sent by air, some routes may take several days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do it faster is to ship it as checked baggage, which the airline policy doesn't allow them to ship without a passenger, which is where you come in.
A common way to fly first or business class is to splurge a bunch of extra cash for the privilege (or, better yet, get your airline to do it for you).
But it doesn't come cheap: there's an unwritten rule that you can expect to pay up to four times as much for business as you would for economy, and up to 11 times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know that there are users who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi»ôinƒÉu, and the official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Don't disrupt the landscape by drawing on buildings or scraping graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, about half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understands it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
But most of the characters will only be in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.

Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled stops are announced in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, using an automated system.
Parisians are known for their selfishness, rudeness and stubbornness.
While this is often just a vague stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is still to be on your best behavior, to behave like a "bien eleve", which makes getting around a lot easier.
If you give them a compliment, the sharp image of the Parisians quickly disappears.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mostly black birch, larch, and spruce, with some alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable diversity of plants due to its range of microclimates, varied soils, and varying elevations.
The area is home to a wide variety of animals and bird species.
It's home to some of Europe's rarest fauna, including brown bears, wolves, eagles, fallow deer, lynxes, wild cats and European wild dogs, as well as many common species.
Women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders when visiting synagogues.

In the same way, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
You can rent one from the consignment store at the entrance, but it's not going to be washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts -- one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always with olive oil.
A popular traditional dinner, especially in the summer, is the Paamb Oli: bread topped with extra virgin olive oil, tomatoes, cheese, tuna, and other toppings.
All nouns for you, including the word Sie, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.

Surviving observatories are usually no longer in use and are preserved as museums or educational facilities.
And because in their heyday, light pollution wasn't the problem it is today, they're often located in cities or on campuses that are more easily accessible than many that are built today.
Most modern survey telescopes are large structures located in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes to us from China, where the peony is the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
The plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take just one sample.
