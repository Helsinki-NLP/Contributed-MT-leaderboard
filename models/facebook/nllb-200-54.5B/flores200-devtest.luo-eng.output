Martelly led the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) to power yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Commission of Inquiry spoke before the resignation of the president of the CEP, as part of its efforts to bring the country closer to new elections.
Martelly's response was that the Commission was responsible for the coup, which began in October.
This sometimes violent rebellion led to difficult decisions, some of which had to be made in early 2011.

Unlike previous radar technology, it uses satellite technology to allow pilots to warn the aircraft in advance and to give accurate feedback.
There will be no public transportation, no trains stopping at Wembley, and no ice skating rinks.
The fear of being stranded led to the conclusion that the game would have to be played behind closed doors.
A recent study published in the journal Science reports the appearance of a new species of finch in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University, in the United States, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, report that the new species evolved over just two generations, a process thought to have taken decades because of the hybridization of Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be cut into all kinds of shapes and sizes.
It can be spun into yarn, which can be used to make paper or cloth.
It could be wrapped in a small metal case or covered with a thin layer of parchment called parchment paper to enhance its appearance.
This is called the pH of the solution, which can be compared to the pH of red cabbage juice.
The color of strep throat changes depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline
The pH units are indicated by the percentage of Hydrogen (H in pH) in the sample.
Hydrogen atoms are protons stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).

The following are minor problems that affect other small animals, ranging from mice to lizards and crocodiles.
Finally, there are the many tiny marsupials (including the domesticated variety) that feed on insects, worms, shrimp, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in their selective monopoly, a special talent that sets them apart from other cats.
Lions in the wild are gregarious, often living in large groups called prides.
A pride is usually made up of one or three adult males and up to 30 adult females and their cubs.
Female lions usually stay close together, forming a large pride made up of sisters and their cubs.
Wandering lions use packs of wolves or hunting dogs, lionlike animals (but not big cats) in the wild, and may kill some animals for food.
A good runner, the tiger can climb trees (not very well), climb slopes, leap great distances, and pull objects with the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is a member of the same family as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The wolf's roar is like that of a maned young lion, but it is more like the howl of a maned young lion.
The wolf's diet consists mainly of small animals, such as rabbits, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that the dinosaurs ate, smelled, and left behind a magnetic field
They can see in the dark and see well at night, and they navigate effectively underwater.
When a small population of organisms (a few in number) is isolated from its normal environment, the migrants (who cross a mountain or a river, or move to another island and cannot easily return) will be found in a different environment than the original one.
The new environment had different resources, different competitors; now the new society would need different things to be more competitive than before.
Rather than having a fixed number of mutations, each successive generation tends to repeat the process.
Gradually, as the population explores its new surroundings, it becomes smaller and smaller, just like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two races encounter an animal that is completely different.
This process is called speciation, the production of new species from existing ones.
Trees produce the oxygen we breathe and take in the carbon dioxide we exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, plants convert sunlight into food and shade.
We build our houses and make our clothes from wood, and we get much of our food from plants, without which animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus, once a voracious predator, now fears only other mosasaurs.
Its long tusks were studded with up to 70 teeth, including some in its upper jaw that were set in such a way that they covered every part of its body.
We cannot be sure, but it likely had a thick hide and a thick hide of some kind, and it ate squid, large fish, and other crustaceans.
It also attacked anything that strayed into the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex were no match for it.
While we may be familiar with many of their dishes, the Romans specialized in delicacies having to do with wild boar, leeks, onions, and garlic.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women sat on couches, the rich and the scholar sat on couches separated from one another.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods imported into Europe from the Americas or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they did not eat peppers, tomatoes, rhubarb, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman would have eaten them.
The Babylonians believed that all the gods of their pantheon resided in the same city - Babylon.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to appease the gods by performing rituals and sacrifices.
Each temple had a courtyard and a covered pool, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes elaborate pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built at the corners of temples.
At the top of that tower was a magnificent temple dedicated to a false god.

Even so, he found that the land had already been inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had many differences in population, rulers, customs, and history.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think of the treasure map on the cover of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the reverse of the parchment, it is not a treasure map.
The preamble to the Declaration of Independence reads, in part, "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows who wrote the codex, it is known that during the early part of the writer's life, the codex - a papyrus scrap measuring some 11 by 10 inches [29 by 24 cm] - was preserved in a locked case.
Now, it seems, his words have become proverbial.
The D-Day invasion and subsequent battles brought freedom to northern France, but not to the south.
It was led by "Vichy" France, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940, and they and their collaborators took over without a fight.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon, an invasion of southern France.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on the march to Germany.
Prosperity is a state of well-being and harmony, characterized by a large and harmonious group of workers, a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civis, meaning citizenship, and civitas, meaning city or town, which in turn suggests the steady growth of populations.
The bombs of the city-states gave birth to the modern world. Modern art and culture means passing on knowledge from generation to generation, setting a perfect example of values and morals and transmitting it accurately.
Characteristics and customs disappear without a trace, leaving no clear narrative trail and failing to be recognized as cultural artifacts.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen colonies formed a federal government - with Congress as the legislative branch - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no legislative power to collect taxes, and since it had no central government or legislature, it relied on state executive departments, none of which were part of the executive branch.
It also lacked authority to regulate local taxation.
The articles called for a unanimous vote of all member nations before any secession could take place, and the smaller nations balked at the idea of a central government with representatives who could adjudicate disputes.
Italy and Germany are the two most successful national football teams in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include boxing, basketball, handball, fencing, boxing, cycling, ice hockey, and chariot racing.
Winter sports are popular in the provinces of the North, with Italians competing in national championships and the Olympics.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because Japan consists of many islands, it is referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the northwest coast of Taiwan, marking the beginning of a seeds-sowing revolution and the hiring of Chinese women as laborers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized Taiwan's western and northern coasts, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures - the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Widows.
Many of the buildings have been restored to show visitors what they looked like when they were built.
By 1976, some 30 caves had been restored, adding to the beauty of the ancient site.
For example, the world's most common movie format was the 35mm format, which was also the standard format until the end of the analog era.
They are still being made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratios have been copied from those of modern digital cameras.
A 35mm lens is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The ratio of the width to the height of this image (divided by 12 to get a simple vertical ratio) is now 3:2.
Many writing systems (such as the APS large typeface, for example) are equivalent to, or analogous to, this convention.
The rule of thirds, or the rule of threes, is a simple rule of thumb for drawing contrasts.
He suggests that the best place to view the ark is from the central platform, which is divided into two sections, or arcs, running from top to bottom and from side to side (see illustration).
At that time in European history, the Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, was under siege.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united Europe despite its linguistic, cultural, and ethnic differences.
His power was recognized by all, from the king to the common people.
One of the fundamental teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church revenues should be used only for that purpose.
After more than a thousand years of the dominance of the Roman hierarchy and the constant increase in power and wealth within the church, many began to question its authority.
Britain responded with a naval blockade of Germany.
The tactic worked, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated international norms that had been widely accepted for the past two centuries.
Britain's submarine fleet, equipped with torpedoes, threatened to sink even civilian ships.
Since so few people tried to escape, the Germans hoped that this would be the answer to their unrelenting attacks on the coast.
During the 1920's, the spirit of the times was one of peace and non-violence.
The horrors unleashed by World War I led many nations to take decisive action to avoid another war
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four volumes of autobiography, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from his former employer, Charles Batchelor, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique system of time-keeping; each step, or dynasty, was ruled by a different ruler.
There were also unusual intervals between dynasties, most notably the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms period, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During that time, fierce battles raged between rival claimants to the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands of people dying in a struggle for supremacy in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
Many social or political achievements have been made, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to democracy, and the development of the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities.
Also, after the Revolution, the government provided jobs for all able-bodied men and promoted skilled tradesmen.
It also extended to military commanders, since pay was regulated not by rank but by geographic location.
The French Revolution also inspired revolutionary movements among oppressed workers in other countries.
Muhammad was deeply curious about the origins of life. He visited a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (holy) where he meditated.
The scrolls themselves, which have also survived for centuries, provide a unique picture of Muhammad's faith.
Some scrolls are isolated on a hill to the north of Mecca.
In fact, it is so difficult to find or even to know of its existence that once inside, a cave becomes a veritable tourist attraction.
Nothing beats the majesty of a clear blue sky, a majestic backdrop of majestic mountains, and the exquisite beauty of a world immersed in thick jungle.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the most impressive structure still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the world's largest pyramids built to honor a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is dotted with pyramids (where the largest pyramid is located), tombs, temples, and the colossal Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, burial chambers, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
The upper arrow points to a V, and the lower arrow points to an open box.

On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, his queen, Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the queen's sister, Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from the Palace of Versailles with a group of businesswomen.
Threatened by an angry mob, they rushed back to Paris and gave the king and queen safe conduct.
The crowd was so large that the King and Queen had to open their car windows.
At one point, a general held up the severed head of the royal guard at Versailles before the stunned Queen.
The soldiers who fought in the American Revolutionary War were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. government in order to pay bribes to lawyers who provided services and contracts to the Philippine government through Wall Street bankers.
Indeed, the long-term profits of the Philippine inhabitants from the lucrative spice trade could have brought untold wealth to the American colonies.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand what led to their invention.
The High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300)
The High Middle Ages were followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages, with their culmination around 1500.
Technocentrism is a broad term that encompasses a range of attitudes, from technocentrism or technocentrism to technocentrism and technocentrism.
Most technological determinism is based on two main assumptions: that technological progress itself is determined by cultural or political processes, and that technology also has "changes" in the society that uses it from its inception, rather than the social conditions of that society.
For example, one might say that faster cars lead to better roads.
However, good roads in rural areas still bring economic benefits to the few who have cars, and new methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
The proliferation of automobiles also increases the likelihood of emergencies, which opens up new avenues of biomedical research.
Romanticism included a wide variety of styles and forms of moral and ethical reasoning, copied from such authors as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Roman Empire, geography was a discipline, and over time, laws and customs based on geography developed, and these, tailored to the needs of the community, were superior to those imposed by force.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
Its reputation as a place of recreation began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
The rivalry died down in the 12th century as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and other items more valuable than those found at Byzantine fairs.
It was around this time that the name of the Fashion Capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic facade between 10th-11th and 14th centuries
At first, the costumes were influenced by icons, a Byzantine tradition from the East.
However, because of the slowness of communication, Western-style clothing could still be worn for 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, eastern European countries began to develop their own styles of clothing.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing only enough food to feed one's family.
Organic gardening is a simple method of farming, usually using a handful of seeds from an overripe ear of corn and crushed corn husks or similar simple techniques to increase the yield of crops.
In ancient times, most farmers grew their own food, and this is still true in developing lands.
Small cultural groups bring together like-minded people who feel excluded from mainstream society and give them the opportunity to develop their own identity and values.
Differences in personality and culture may be seen, for example, in age, education, social class, education level, and occupation.
Such factors as linguistic, social, religious, political, geographic, cultural, or aesthetic differences may be involved.
Members of a minority group often present themselves as members of a distinct and recognizable ethnic group, with its own distinctive dress, customs, and ceremonies.
A common approach to illustrating the value of communication is to use simple examples of children who, because of neglect, abuse, or neglect, have had little or no contact with adults in their early years.
Some children are "incarcerated" (usually by their parents); others are abandoned because of parental rejection because of a physical or mental disability.
Abandoned children may have been abused or neglected before they were abandoned or went astray.
Some say that he was raised in a stable; others say that he lived in the woods.
When raised in captivity, a wolf cub displays (to a limited extent) all the characteristics of its human caretakers, such as fear and aloofness.
While research is supposed to make study easier and more pleasurable, using a tool is even more important.
Using a textbook is not a form of learning but, rather, a tool to help those learning a new skill, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
A building clock may be a physical clock, a teacher may be a physical clock, but so is a file clerk in a Microsoft office.
Bible study aids are computer programs designed to question, warn, and explain Scriptural principles that would be too difficult for students to apply on their own.
children are sheltered from dangers such as neglect, abuse, or exploitation
No child deserves to grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of care, attention, and education.
We know that the Foster Care System is a safe and secure environment for such children.
shelters for the homeless should be safe, cared for, and medically trained
Day-care centers should provide the best care possible.
The Internet is not just a social network but also a personal one.
Variety As technology advanced, so did the complexity of situations, their management, and their perception.
For example, "education" and "social networking" are considered important social motivators for using social networks (Jakobo et al., 1995).
"Self-engagement" and "continuous browsing" have been promoted as a form of bullying, according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying social interaction with websites.
The use of video cameras has led to some remarkable breakthroughs in changing the body language, facial expressions and gestures that occur in very young girls.
Especially is it said that a person can tell when someone is lying by the way he moves his lips.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, described hearing loss as a disorder in which the brain is unable to evaluate consciousness accurately.
He also suggested that similar abilities could be trained in domestic animals, such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century suggested that there are two types of genes - the so-called hidden gene and the open gene.
Mutations introduce new variations into an organism, selectively eliminating existing variations.
This splitting and merging disrupts the flow of genetic information back and forth between the two species in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a large mammal with a stomach the size of a human's to obtain all the amino acids it needs from vegetation alone.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: premature aging, severe malnutrition, and premature death.
A plant's main source of nutrition may be the proteins found in its leaves and seeds, but a large animal like us cannot digest this food unless it is cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (such as mushrooms, beans, and eggs) are not only digestible but also rich in protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
At the very least, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep deprivation is like waking up at the same time every day and then going back to sleep 10 to 60 minutes later.
This may be easier said than done if your alarm clock tries to rouse you from a nap.
If you find that your alarm clock is set to go off when you are asleep, you may have to move it to another part of the room, leaving you no choice but to get up and change it.
Other biorhythm suggestions include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, so that you have to get up to urinate.
A calm heart is closely related to a healthy body and mind.
It is good for the soul to be strengthened by grace, and to be strengthened by hope.
One obstacle to obtaining accurate knowledge is our own fears and prejudices.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also incorporates elements of Mahayana Buddhism and the rich philosophy of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its teachings - Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (the force of true consciousness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, spoken words, and visualization.
The most important Tibetan spiritual practice is Deity Yoga. Through the practice of meditation on various deities, the energy channels are purified, awakening the chakras and establishing pure consciousness.
During World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States forged an alliance against Germany.
By the time the war ended, former friends had become enemies, and a cold war had begun.
It was to last 40 years and to be fought, literally, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish army had been completely routed, and the only remaining hope was to surrender and reorganize under Roman command.
However, those plans came to nothing that night as 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops poured into Belarus and Ukraine and formed a defensive wall after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Serving Mary involves more than buying and selling; it involves serving others.
The navy's mission is to ensure the safety of navigation and to destroy the enemy's ability to attack.
A notable example of this was the North Atlantic Blockade, in which the United States sought to cut off supplies to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, especially its U-boats, tried to stem the tide.
If the Allies had not intervened, Germany could have taken over Britain, which was still occupied by the Europeans.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes raised them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Wild goats were kept in herds and left to graze on the open plains, much like today's world-famous pastoralists
Horse-drawn carriages were developed in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn wagons to travel faster and more efficiently than paved roads of the day
Gradually, though, it became evident that chariots with iron scythes on the top would be more reliable.
Such tires became a common sight, but they proved to be a real threat to wooden chariot wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by cast-iron ones, and in 1767 the first locomotives were introduced.
The earliest known form of human locomotion was on foot, and humans evolved to walk upright about two billion years ago during the evolution of Homo erectus.
Their successors, the Australopithecines, did not walk erect.
Bipedal gait is found in the fossil remains of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make friends with our fears, we can join organizations that support our fears, and we can become activists against our fears in order to reduce future oppression on some level.
But if we want more than temporary relief, we need to get to the root of the problem and deal with it.
There is no denying that human society is undergoing profound changes as a result of technological and scientific advances, as well as unprecedented social and environmental upheavals.
After the Senate passed the bill on July 4, a handwritten copy with the signatures of John Hancock, president of the Senate, and Charles Thomson, secretary of state, went into John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first reading of the document took place outside with John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to the troops in New York on July 9, and the copy reached London on August 10.
Only 25 Dunlap Broadsides are known to have survived; the original manuscript is lost.
Today, most paleontologists believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived into modern times - birds.
Many do not think of dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
Birds still have much in common with dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and sharp teeth, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like dinosaurs.
You see, the computer that controls the world's computers uses a secret code called binary.
Binary numbers can only be 0 or 1, and their digits are known as binary digits - or bits, as they are used in computers.
For example, medical emergencies may be reported immediately, and the baby may not even be aware of them.
An open container of medicine or even some household chemicals is a good place to start.
Read the label on the bottle for first aid instructions for poisoning yourself.
The word "book" is used by entomologists as a synonym for the study of insects.
The word is derived from the ancient name for Bedbugs, blood-sucking insects.
Both males and females give birth to live young in shelters or nests.
Throughout the United States, about 400,000 people have multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neuromuscular disorder in young and middle-aged people.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that pregnant women are twice as likely to develop MS as college-educated women.
A couple may decide to forgo their own love or that of their unborn child in order to have another child.
The couple may decide to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish their parental authority to the prospective adoptive parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the universe works by using the scientific method, which is the basis for most scientific research.
It is not limited to experimental research, but it often includes the use of one or more of the following: formulating hypotheses, formulating questions, and providing explanations.
Geographers and philosophers had a particular interest in ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's great ideas laid the foundation for all science, including philosophy.
As Greek civilization declined, the Orient found itself cut off from the philosophies and sciences of the Greeks.
Many people are discovering how hormones move and behave over time and how hormones are released based on the biology of the body.
Well-organized waste disposal, not accidental dumping, is the hallmark of many organisms, including bacteria, insects, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-regulating oscillators that keep time even in the absence of external power.
The Hershey-Chase experiments were among the first to conclude that DNA was a blood product.
Scientists Hershey and Chase experimented by injecting bacterial cells with a virus.
In two experiments, they exposed the phage's DNA to radioactive phosphorus or the phage's proteins to radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can produce different outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the size of the altered gene pool, and whether the altered cells have the potential to become mature embryos.
germ cell mutations are the only ones that can be passed from parent to offspring
Nature tours appeal to the casual visitor who enjoys the scenery, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and ecotourism.
Among other things, they visit, photograph, and study the Bornean orangutan.
Early in the morning, people drive from the minefields to their workplaces and mingle with fellow workers in the area.
In today's increasingly interdependent transportation system, there is a need to integrate and promote transportation systems based on private vehicles.
Scientists now know that human emissions of carbon dioxide have caused the atmosphere to lose one of the few stable equilibriums that has sustained human life for the past two billion years.
Almost everyone complains about the transportation system, and the only thing that seems to work is the air conditioning.
In the developed world, such complaints about water shortages or pollution are rare.
Why are transportation systems subject to such accidents, why do they crash so often, are traffic controllers lazy, or is something more important going on?
Traffic engineering is the study of the behaviour of drivers and vehicles as they travel between two destinations and interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to read a car's speed, since it is impossible to judge a driver's behavior at 60 miles per hour [100 km/ hr].
Fortunately, the driver follows a well-defined route; now the traffic patterns are organized and controlled by a computer.
To illustrate the accuracy of traffic flow, three key factors are (1) how much traffic there is, (2) where it is, and (3) how fast it is moving.
This coordination enables the driver to plan, direct, and control the flow of traffic.
Insects were the first air-breathing animals, and their sense of smell enabled them to evade predators and to find food and mate easily.
Many insects have the ability to fold their wings inside their body.
This gives them plenty of room to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fly are bats and termites.
More than a millennium ago, the Greek philosopher Aristarchus presented the idea that the planets revolve around the sun.
Some thought that he was correct, but many had a different opinion; that the Solar System, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since the earth is not stationary, is it?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest and largest river, with a water volume seven times that of the second-largest river on earth.
The Amazon River flows four and a half miles [6 km] to the south.
More than 20 trillion gallons of water gush into the ocean from the Amazon basin.
The Amazon River is some 3,900 miles (6,387 km) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Middle Ages, the great pyramids of Giza never attained their full splendor.

Italian is the official language, and Latin is used in religious services.
Vatican City is part of the Roman Catholic Church.
Gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, and they can be found in the earth's crust and are easily mined with ancient tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one, two, or four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
These were similar to the four basic elements (in the same order): liquid, solid, gas, and plasma, but they also took on new forms to produce what we see with our eyes.
Remember, there are many other elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered salts, and there are other salts, such as silver and gold.
You may also have a bag that contains a small amount of unsaturated carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of atoms, the smallest building blocks of matter.
The particles are so small that there could be trillions of them at the end of this sentence.
Hence, the pen was a valued traveling companion.
Sadly, as new writing methods have become available, the pencil has lost some of its usefulness.
Nowadays, people type a short message on a computer screen, which is held up to their eye with a stylus.
One can only wonder what will happen if something new comes along.
A fission bomb works this way, taking energy to assemble a nucleus, which has many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a lever and slamming it into a mountain.
Some atoms have nuclei that are unstable, meaning that they cannot be broken apart by nuclear reactions.
The moon's crust is made of rock and dust.
The earth's crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick at the poles and 60 miles [100 km] at the equator.
He crouches beneath it and tears apart the mountains.
Near me, perhaps a dozen young women were busy plowing a field, their heads covered with a thick layer of grass.
Persuasive theories focus on finding reasons for why people behave the way they do or what appeals to them.
The counsel you share with others reflects the needs and desires that are nurtured throughout adulthood.
The theory is based on the observation that people's desires and fears influence their actions and reactions.
Two popular theories of motivation are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
When it comes to everyday discipline, there are two general trends that can develop when a manager comes to dominate his former colleagues.
A long-suffering manager may find it difficult to enforce agreed-upon procedures, discipline disobedient employees, or monitor performance, delegate tasks, and hold everyone accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, there is the cynic who feels compelled to change everything about his or her routine, making it his or her own.
After that, it is up to the manager to make the final decision.
This creates tension between management and workers.
Workers who come from the countryside expect to be treated the same as regular office workers, but there is little difference.
The members of a deliberative assembly are usually the presiding officers of the body.
They often have greater autonomy than face-to-face groups because they can arrange their meetings according to different time zones without interfering with their fearful leaders.
The authenticity of the "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique feature of members of groups that exist in nature.
"Members of the stewardship" preside over the arrangements for the respectful conduct of secular employees.
Why would an organization want to adopt a time-consuming method of organizational learning?

Before an organization can innovate, leaders must foster new ideas as well as develop strategies and organizational practices.
Angel (2006), defines the Continuum concept as the process used to help organizations achieve high levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide compelling evidence for theoretical approaches to studying brain development.
The link between brain disorders and behavior is the subject of many scientific studies.
It has long been known that a variety of neurological disorders, such as trauma, tumors, and seizures, influence behavior and alter certain brain functions.
The advent of new technology has allowed us to see and probe the brain in ways never before possible. . . .
It also provides a wealth of information and building blocks for the neural circuits that make up our brain.
Although AI has its roots in science fiction, AI constitutes a well-established branch of computer science, based on behavior, learning and artificial intelligence.
AI research involves designing machines to perform tasks that mimic human intelligence.
Examples include the ability to direct, organize, and respond to customer inquiries and messages, as well as to recognize handwriting, tone of voice, and facial expressions.
Such developments have resulted in a divided society that has followed the ways of the world.
AI is already being used in economics, medicine, engineering, and warfare, as well as in countless home computers and computer games.
School trips are an important part of any classroom, and a teacher may often arrange for transportation to and from his classes.
Students can enjoy excursions to museums, aquariums, or nature reserves from the comfort of their classrooms.
Virtual group visits are also an excellent way to reflect on the visit and to share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at bennett high school in north carolina create a web page about their visit to the state capitol, and each year the page is redesigned and the old page is archived for future reference.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. When students start their blogging skills with confused language but incorrect spelling, the presence of readers influences these changes.
Since the students are attentive listeners, the translators try to eliminate ambiguity.
Writing research papers also "requires students to have a deeper understanding of the complexities of the world in which they live". The desire to meet the needs of the audience or readers of the papers encourages students to be intelligent and entertaining (Toto 2004).
Gossip promotes organization and keeps readers more involved than ever.
The use of an ethical blog "can encourage students to participate; as they become participants in the discussion, students can contribute their research to peer reviews". (Oravec 2020)
