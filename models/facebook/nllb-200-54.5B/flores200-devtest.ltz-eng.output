This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft (called a spindle), but have other features of feathers - barbs and rays - the researchers concluded that the spindle was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance. The researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is of adult feathers and not the feathers of a juvenile.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is of adult feathers and not the feathers of a juvenile.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most dark matter is in a halo around a galaxy and is composed of many small particles.
Television reports showed white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners and not drink tap water.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high lethality rate".
Some patients may have been stabbed at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were by hospital staff.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the overall group of people with TB still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people have been infected at any given time in South Africa.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been pledged by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.
Plans to deliver the vaccines to the historically worst-affected areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funding and low priority compared to other diseases.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations from day to night prove that they are probably caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are consistent with having deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper identifying their preferred candidate inside an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law tends to codify procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the ballot and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to special procedures.

This is common in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists appear to be walking a fine line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters that it would not comment further until charges were laid.
The document refers to the disputed border area claimed by Palestine based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders, according to the data leak.
Other reportedly discussed topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority wants to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers as the study is monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director of parks and heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting were given extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests have been triggered by failed elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it knows of one in 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not concerning".
The department responded to Apple's omission of the report by calling it "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7.19am local time (Friday 9.19am GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later captured the scene of an elderly lady having to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began spending his spare time examining premature babies.
His research showed that when a hormone was released, it accelerated fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even a little more ... I loved her and miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia as a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited while playing.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets were likely a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic materials that form proteins and can support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year at age 53 and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly short distances while saving millions of tons of fuel and reducing CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is used and overflow trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the ground.
The fear of falling vehicles raised the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of bird on Ecuador's GalÃ¡pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although the process probably took much longer due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes.
It can be made into thin wire, which can be twisted and crushed. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books, called "pictorial handwriting".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing them to stick together and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated furnace water system.
In the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, relics of furnace water systems have been found.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women mixed socially.
If you want to call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in the image.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in indescribable ways. The biggest advantage we owe to the bicycle is much faster and easier means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and red deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats), which eat the much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups known as packs.
A pack consists of one to four adult males, along with up to thirty females and juveniles.
The females are usually closely related to each other because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lovebugs behave somewhat like those of wolves or dogs - animals that are surprisingly responsive to love (but not other big cats) in behavior - and they are also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The eye of the tiger is not like the full-voiced eye of a lion, but rather like a set of hoarse, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when they can.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals for food (catches) by sniffing where they were on the ground.
Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as when they move across a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, without which animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the gum, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included barnacles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't keep up with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had many strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a bat.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women sat and ate in silence, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, lying on the side while eating.
Meals in Ancient Rome could not include foods that would come to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, wild corn or tomatoes or potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever ate honeydew.
The Babylonians had a primary temple for each of their gods, which they believed was the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers - called ziggurats - were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was called the Most Holy Place.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the garden, the shops were just open counters on the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences in the people, kings, kingdoms, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Legacy of the Templars", you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote this, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in his life.
So it's likely that the notation was just added as a description.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by significant numbers of people living and working together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also somehow determines the size of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustained cultural footprint and an orderly dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation - with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because it had no national executive or judiciary, it relied on often uncooperative state agencies to enforce its actions.
It also did not have the power to suspend tax laws and excise taxes between states.
The clauses required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states tended to defer to the central government, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan traces its origins to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous core production and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most commonly used photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratios have largely been superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, you can kind of twist it a little bit, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) conform to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For a thousand years, the Christian religion held Europe together despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
Its pervasiveness has affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since there was only a limited response to these tactics, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job).
Ancient China had a unique way of designating different eras: each phase of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of uncertainty with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the "Three Kingdoms" period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for supremacy in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to grab it.
The same was true for the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in things beyond this worldly life. He repeatedly visited a cave known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Noor' (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the centuries, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is located on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. When you are in the cave, you can see and hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "upward boom" looks like a V and the "downward boom" looks like a bracket or square with the bottom missing.
Top means you should start at the top and push the bow and bottom means you should start at the mill (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more definite.
Feel free to make your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed tree markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be kept.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Ã‰lisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a participant in the mob held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, and much of the spending and interest on the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice; from the technology push or technological must to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher accident rate on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In relation to Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time spaces and cultures associated with that geography emerged that were, because they were in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, the Byzantine culture in the East had a very strong influence on Gezei.
Western styles, however, could be 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments from this time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system that combines seeds from the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures similarly bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be unrecognizable based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to argue the importance of socialization is to refer to some fortunate cases of children who were not socialized due to neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse by adults while growing up.
Some feral children were confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this confinement was due to the child's rejection of severe mental or physical treatment by the parents.
Juvenile runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been eaten by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If the child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost completely similar to those of the respective pet, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals who are undertaking a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a schoolteacher is a form of scaffolding, but so are the small office advertisements in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to query, prompt and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, social and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our care system should provide a safe home, caregivers who are very warm, a stable education and reliable health care.
Care accommodation should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent properties of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification.
Thus, for example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience responses to Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements of a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand language due to hearing impairment are quite capable of accurately judging sincerity.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior are shared by animals such as pets.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move the variation with each generation back and forth between the two poles.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements with the available plant resources.
What's more, there are serious consequences if you don't: stunted growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (sea cucumbers, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a wealth of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally awakening during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes later).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively slow alarm clock to bring you to consciousness but not fully awaken you.
If you reset the clock while sleeping, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own expansion and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture led to the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies became enemies, which started the Cold War.
It's going to last for the next 40 years, and it's going to be deployed in real time by surrogates on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and countless other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army marched into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to move its people and goods while simultaneously disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to get men and materiel across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried, mainly with U-boats, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples considered them an easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved to hills or other pasture areas, often tended by goat herders, who were often children and adolescents, some as well-known herders.
Narrow gauge railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although log rails consisted mainly of parallel wooden rails, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Rail sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold the rails in place, but it gradually became apparent that rails were more efficient if they had an ice bar on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-steel rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, didn't walk upright like they used to.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like a symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should fix them.
It is obvious that mankind's scientific and technological advances have greatly changed the world and have increased the problems caused by overpopulation and mankind's excessive lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July; a copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists are convinced that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today: we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits (to use computer language).
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as fractures are common enough that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of underlying poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemical.
On the label you will find specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term jawed vertebrates is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the predators and the bed bugs are nocturnal, having adapted to life in the nest or the dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest - or that of their child - to raise a baby.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method. This method definitely guides most scientific research.
However, it does not do this alone, experimenting - and an experiment is a test used to disprove one or more of the possible hypotheses - asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Rhythms rarely observed in physiology and behavior often depend critically on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue for some time even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that either labeled the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphor or labeled the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work and pass by those whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you hear a lot of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation planners simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be graphed mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can retract their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
And that makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, measuring some 6 miles [9.7 km] across.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and technical achievement of the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since antiquity, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper because they can all be found in nature in natural form and can be mined relatively easily with primitive history.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more than the four aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surreally small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the pencil has become less important and used.
People now type messages on computer screens and don't need a translator anymore.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
And then the nucleus splits again and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they break apart with little or no ejection.
The lunar surface is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The coast is about 70 km wide on the near side and about 100 km wide on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker over the highlands.
There may be more marls on the closed side because the coast is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people tick or what makes them tick.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are forgotten as they enter adulthood.
This theory considers what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and how things in their environment make them want certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to manage their former colleagues: One end of the spectrum attempts to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels like she has to change everything the team did and make it her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as advocates for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to the corresponding time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional areas of an enterprise, creativity and resourcefulness can be expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the requirements of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby broadening the scope of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with valuable information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, but are also incorporated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions form a large part of every class. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions.Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is updated every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the attentiveness of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to reconnect with the world around them". The need to engage the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of others' comments and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more elevate Ontario above what foreigners consider typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that might surprise many, there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself when it comes to flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel, to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be stalked, groped, etc.
Don't be shy about rejecting men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences aside, it's not right either).
The present city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, faience, leather goods, hookahs and a plethora of geishas, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tours in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
It was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1990 due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the stations featured during Henry Louis Gates' PBS Special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main tourist attractions and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering ball chart illustrated by the vastness of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is packed tightly onto reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching over 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once stretched across the Ganges.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal tigers and over 30,000 red deer in the area.
Buses depart from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most prefectures are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two 3.5 m wide footbridges.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs inspection is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Rice Province of India", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous indigenous group.
For the Spanish, the colonial era began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las CaÃ±itas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the AsociaciÃ³n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is commonly used throughout the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted in Stanley.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency are accepted; check in advance with the owners what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures are usually above +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity condense to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no distinct "rainy" and "dry" season: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although rare animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, one should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and just about any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
In addition, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods and keep storage areas clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau Movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful meeting in the town led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches around Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most provide shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
There are two local beers, the main one is "Number One", it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and lively; the other is called "Manta".
There are a lot of must-try French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be easier to get to.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are unsure.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is exotic: a short black is called an espresso, a cappuccino has whipped cream on top, and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask the authorities for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, box jellyfish have frequented beaches and estuaries from October to April.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If booked in advance, the traveler can rest assured that he will be able to sleep elsewhere when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include coffee, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Changes or inquiries should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the action, you'll have to get up early to get a campsite close to the music.
Note that even if the music on the main stages ends, there may still be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the passage of ice can cause quite eerie noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos are usually very strict to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests happy and grounded.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, alcohol impairs judgment and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On gravel and snow roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were driving on macadam.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to stun a person.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blown snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic usually continues unimpeded throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars and standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwal
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a sticky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between Â¥2,500 and Â¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around Â¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed even if you are not in the room.
If no iron is available, or you don't feel like wearing stretched socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to stick or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some regions it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, while others require several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their home regions.
Pests can digest food, cause irritation or in the worst case induce allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often driving through remote forests.
If you are used to driving on country roads, keep your mistakes to a minimum: avoid hills, narrow alleys and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - usually 56 - 64 km/h (35 - 40 mph) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Curiously, however, cell service is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit cakes are common; apples are baked in cakes year-round and cherries and plums are added in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other legumes. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're looking for small but rich pastries, try what's known locally as Berliner, pancakes or donuts.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "salty" depending on the liquid content.
In border regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, the term usually means food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being cocoa beans, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's legs and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but gets a foot stuck in the stirrup, he could be trampled if the horse runs away.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a waist and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety pins that allow a climbing harness to fall off the saddle if left behind by a falling rider.
CochamÃ³ Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with rare large granite walls and boulders.
Some offer breathtaking views from the summits, and climbers from all parts of the world continue to find new routes through the infinite potential of walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending snow-covered terrain with skis attached to the feet or a snowboard.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski fanatics", planning their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of navigation is very old - cave paintings depicting navigators date back to 5000 BC!
Ski jumping as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called ski touring, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to, but not usually associated with, alpine-style touring or mountaineering, the latter of which takes place on steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and shoes.
You can think of a ski run as another hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot - but you rarely reach the speeds of running without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to apply for several visas and pass through passport controls.
The Schengen area functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition according to which handmade items are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the age limit in countries such as North America being lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Samis and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other occupations.
Also, traditionally, not all Sami were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting, etc. and kept reindeer largely as farm animals.

Rip currents are the returning currents of waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in some deeper sections and can form a fast current into the deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to get somewhere you can't get back to, or depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be advisable to wait for rescue.
Entry shock occurs earlier and, unlike culture shock (which has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be severe.

When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding because they know that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be extended to travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, and the story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is seen as the background and narrator of a long narrative.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau here, then emerge again to form the 220-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by the shipping industry, including recreational boats, as well as expeditions requiring external data and voice recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year abroad is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with high school dropouts, allowing them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.

Usually, tuition fees are charged to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful holiday destination for boat trips.The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has several thousand islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats or just a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland with a boat for seven to eight people.
This is the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unique elsewhere (for example, the number in the Netherlands is one in 40).
Most of the various Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only enter the country by boat, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. However, as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not on the sea and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that a lot of other people have.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver items quickly, often with time critical business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the largest companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies it became a problem.
If they sent items by air freight, it may have taken several days on some routes before everything was unloaded and cleared customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger and that's where you come in.
The obvious thing about flying first or business class is that you have to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company pay for you).
But it doesn't come cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as business class and eleven times as much as first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core of air travelers - who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably - and they demand accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is ChiÅŸinÄƒu. The national language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties were re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Ä°zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the population speaks Catalan, a very large proportion understands it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.

Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by an automated system in numerous languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, hawk, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be found there, along with many other species.
While visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go over the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide an overcoat for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colored one, you will be greeted with a smile from the man or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear boxes that go above the knees.
You can also borrow it from the staff at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every use, so one may not feel comfortable wearing the skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.

But people who speak little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually abandoned and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor held the first Christmas flower festival only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake in an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Easter Saturday during the Easter weekend, with communities often celebrating the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew, or floated.
Due to the great distance to the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the first herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in the winter, you experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire and employees address each other by surname or job title.
