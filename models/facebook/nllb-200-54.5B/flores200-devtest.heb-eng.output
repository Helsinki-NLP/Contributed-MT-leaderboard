Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already popular theory, but it also provides details that fossils can't usually provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was a brownish-purple on top with a pale carotenoid underneath.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a developed stalk, called a frill, but have other features of feathers - fins and eyelashes - the researchers concluded that the frill was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal rather than the plumage of a chick.

In France, voting is traditionally an experience of simple technology: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed page in an envelope listing the candidate they are voting for.
After the clerks verify his identity, the voter opens the ballot envelope and signs the register.

Candidates can send delegates to witness every step of the process. In the evenings, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Adekoya has since appeared in court in Edinburgh charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting conviction and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted because her photo went viral.
It's standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and courts have seen the publication of images as potentially biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that journalists do seem willing to take risks if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Judicial Service, which handles all prosecutions, told reporters there would be no further comment at least until a conviction.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
According to reports, other issues discussed are the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley question.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
It was decided that the shooters in the additional pest control experiment should be under the close supervision of foresters, as the experiment is under supervision and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
"In conjunction with the Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Rifle Association of Australia, qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Rifle Association's hunting program".
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting attempt received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member CEP yesterday.
This is Myrtle's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the disbandment of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure to hold elections, which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called not serious".
"The department responded by calling Apple's rejection of the report "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports no damage in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that taking the hormone would have accelerated the fetal lung development of the baby.
"The Xinhua News Agency reports that government investigators found two flight recorders on Wednesday".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first queen of actors. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Unique just like her.
"Dustin Goldust Runnels said Luna was a freak like me... maybe even more so... I love her and I'll miss her... hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome his pain because it was forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various materials and software in early February and the announcement came out on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water to Earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He dismissed the rumors as idle chatter and political nonsense".
There's speculation he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate planes more accurately and give pilots more accurate information".
No additional transport and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and valet facilities are not available on site.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer, due to the cross between the endemic Darwin's fly (Geospiza fortes), and the large migratory cactus fly (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire, which can be twisted and folded.
"It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator out of red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) in the chemicals being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped from them (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet, clean hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the towns of Arapa and Moenjodaro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then relays it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and mirrors.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much larger number of small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special role each cat plays that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, along with as many as 30 females and cubs.
The females are usually close together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not to other big cats), and like them particularly deadly to their prey.
Extremely athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the mighty roar of a lion, it's more like a sentence of words shouted impatiently.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals the ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think ocelots find prey and track them by scent, by sniffing the ground they walk on.
Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into the environment and then leaping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
In this new environment there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations than they needed in the past to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all. They still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process differentiation, which means the creation of new species, and differentiation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of our food is plants, without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning anyone who got in its way couldn't escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't stand up to it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have strange or unusual items for the festivities, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a nematode.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have meals together where they would lie on their sides while they ate their meal.
It's impossible that ancient Roman meals included dishes that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a major temple that was considered the house of the god.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his travels west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words the original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, the large card document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled for storage.
Therefore, it's likely that the marking was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were marching towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a society to some extent.
A civilization's culture implies a transfer of knowledge across multiple generations, a cultural footprint and a relatively large distribution.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce its laws.
And it didn't have the authority to override the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before any amendment could be added, and the states treated the federal government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
"The Italy national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful national team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion".
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of Japan's archipelago, it is often defined as an archipelago from a geographical point of view".
"The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, changing traditional grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1912-1644) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
"For example, the world's most common silent film format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era".
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited into digital camera image formats.
"The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high".
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family, for example) are at or near this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been ridiculed and abused, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the central subject of a photograph is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, came under severe criticism.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and culture.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the central beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically earmarked for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had resided in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money had led many to wonder if that principle had been maintained.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated accepted international laws signed in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited U-boat warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and countries was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again.
"In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York".
"He came to America with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China had its own way of representing different periods of time; each period of Chinese history or each ruling family had a unique dynasty.
Also, between the dynasties there was an unstable era of divided provinces known as the Three Kingdoms period which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. fighting to sit on the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, moving from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted them, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This was true in the military because instead of rank being based on status, it was now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He would often visit a notoriously dark cave on Mount Nur to immerse himself in deep contemplation".
The cave itself, which has survived throughout history, provides a very rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all even if you know it exists.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains around. You can see or hear very little of this world from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built for the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built for his wives and members of Khufu's family.
"The upward-arching mark looks like a V and the downward-arching mark like a staple or a square without its bottom edge".
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the withers and pull the bow.
An upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while a lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the notes are there for a musical reason, so stick to them generally.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of courtesans.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to throw open their carriage windows.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism for the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to their founding.
The era in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from push technology or technological imperative to a stronger sense that human destiny is based on logic arising from the laws of nature and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development proceeds in a way that is not significantly influenced by culture or politics, and that technology has effects on societies that are constructed, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, you could say that the car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed in order to lower the cost of car ownership.
The proliferation of private cars also increases the frequency of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health to repair bodily damage.
The Romantic movement contained a large element of cultural determinism inspired by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography arose, and these, because of their harmony with the place of society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed rules.
As Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
There was a decline in its status during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silks and spices whose value was higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was deeply influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming designed to produce enough food to exactly meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, method that uses seeds saved from the ecological zone in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have been subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically mark their membership through a unique and symbolic use of style including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to learn from the isolated unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse, did not experience socialization by adults while growing up.
"Such children are called feral children. Some feral children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, abandonment has occurred due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability".
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (under physical limitations) almost identical to those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding but also the little paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are designed to ask, respond to and explain challenging processes that students may have difficulty handling on their own.
Children are sent to foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect, to abuse and even extortion.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that learning and friendship are important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)".
"Personal involvement and ongoing relationships have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Amy and Cord (1998) when studying audience responses to Web sites".
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it was claimed that you could tell if a person was lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess honesty accurately.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior are also shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two reservoirs with each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them if they're not cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide large amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same ways that savannah chimpanzees do today".
Sleep paralysis is a process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be moved to the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other time-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing the sleeper to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force is.
The only thing standing between it and our goals is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but this has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
With kundalini yoga, the energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and imagination.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the divine being, whereby visual thought of various divine beings clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, the contradictions of systems, procedures and cultures led to a dispute between the countries".
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
"It took place over the next 40 years and the actual fighting was done by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places".
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and re-form along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your products, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and their products.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them for convenient access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed over hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who in many cases were children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherd.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were constructed of only parallel timber, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
Cross ties were introduced quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the rails would be more effective if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron further eroded the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, didn't walk upright as often.
Bipedal abilities have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and we have to neutralize them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advancement, and problems have increased because of mankind's overpopulation and dispersive life-style.
After passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap sheets.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to live today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But a lot of things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one or two values, that is, 0 or 1, these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning would be the presence of an open prescription bottle or bottles of household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both predatory and bed bugs are nest-dwellers that have adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), so it's still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
Couples may decide it's not in their best interest, or their child's best interest, to have a baby.
These couples can choose to adopt their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides, in fact, most scientific research.
But it's not the only one -- an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
"Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible".
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior, often critically dependent on the presence of internal cycles, and shaped by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for a period of time in regular cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where we marked the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline progenitor cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to their jobs and pass other people whose home is where they just left it.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is in some way connected and supportive of a private car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same amount of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems draw such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply untalented? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to stay within a logically consistent range; therefore, traffic flow usually has a logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we established relationships between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from maniacs.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite was true; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
"The length of the main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no structure rivaled the pyramids at Giza in size and construction excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed the theory that everything was composed of one or more of four elements, which were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also claimed that they transform into new materials to create what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, once in use, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing systems, the pencil's status declined and its use declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
A fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Nuclear fission again releases some of the same energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
"The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side".
It's thinner below sea level and thicker below.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the core to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding that one thing that motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow older.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things that they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"Broadly speaking, two behaviors can erupt when people become the managers of their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes unrecognizable and feels he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as liaisons with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may be incomprehensible to their local management.
"The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The invisible team is the management team to which all team members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each team member".
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
When all available resources in all functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and innovation can occur.
As a result, a process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material that we need to build simulation models, which help us understand processes in our own minds.
Although AI carries a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, concerned with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence includes the development of machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military. It has also been installed in some software for home computers and computer games.
Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting alongside their classmates.
Sharing a shared virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share future classroom experiences.
For example, every year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina build a website on their trip to the state capitol, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a memoir.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, an audience often changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs may empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their own position in the context of others' writing, as well as articulate their own perspective on certain topics (Oraver, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka County and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario stand out as a typical Canadian city to outsiders.
Large areas north of there are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
"A population comparison that will surprise many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens".
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it gained a wide hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would see as harassment, and that it's not uncommon for someone to stalk them, grab their arm, etc.
There have been attacks on rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
"The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and served the Phoenicians, Romans and Marranos as a strategic port called Anfa".
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bayda and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old country it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan items, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of small items, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, a sinkhole was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be checked to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, along with some of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trails.
You can use a Buda-Buda (motorcycle taxi) to get around the hole. The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for exotic and distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger of desert sand.
"It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS special The Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
"The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports different wildlife".
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are conservation and two-day entry fees to the park.
You may also want to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place Rabin tourists regard as a major focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a shimmering bar diagram revealed by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon coastline opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is where the British settlers saw themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
"The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India".
"The Sunderbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sunderbans National Park".
But the forests aren't just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
"The Sunderbans forest covers 3,850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water areas or grasslands".
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it's estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakhar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most prefectures are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 NGN) and Punakha (200 NGN).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River between the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.5 meters.
The minimum height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes like the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"16th-century Paraguay, once called the vast Province of the Indies, was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadores and local indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and players who are some of the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year was held in December at the Las Ca√±itas polo grounds.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, search the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound will be accepted en route everywhere on the islands and within Stanley often credit cards and US dollars will also be accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the outer islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; summer temperatures often exceed 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F).
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
"There are no defined rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how comfortable they seem, bison, elk, caribou, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
"The harbor was the site of a famous maritime dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S. and Britain refused to leave port".
All the ships were sunk, except one British patrol boat, and almost 200 Germans and British lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the killing of paramount leader Tupua Tamasese Lilupe III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is spread over two harbours. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore (in North Harbour District) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by the Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are in the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are often crowded with a great variety of shops along the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', this is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more travel-friendly.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are concerned, bottled mineral water is very easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Standard Belgian hot chocolate, expensive but delicious fruit juices.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries from any of these factors on the reef are rare.
Still, take the advice of authorities, obey all signs and listen carefully to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the invitation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay on site, and most attendees see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you'll have to get in early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ended, there may still be areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cell, because crossing ice makes a pretty terrible noise in the most exposed cells.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, friction is low and you won't be able to drive as well as you would on exposed asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to trap you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari tours are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many travellers.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow you to watch them comfortably.
Lions, cheetahs and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called bushwalking, backpacking, or jogging) consists of walking for several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have run into a problem.
There are a variety of cancellation policies, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover until July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with most tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not care for ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it's enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of different filters varies, and if you have concerns, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to their areas of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more serious cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, are usually not defined as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Apple-Pittsburgh Expressway, and often passes through desolate and isolated country.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are many steep steps, narrow paths, and sharp curves along the way.
"The posted speed limits are considerably lower than the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual".
Strangely, cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route, like the wilds of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they're rich and varied, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries can be found year-round while cherry and plum pastries arrive in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually especially suitable for a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the regionally named Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Karpen.
Curry is a dish based on spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid".
In the dry regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a wide range of regional cuisines from around the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term refers to food originating in the central and eastern regions of the central island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of plainly spiced dishes, and the prominent flavors that Javanese like are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
Saddles provide support for the rider's legs hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot catches in the saddle, he can be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with flat, narrow heels and soles.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the arch skin to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks have breathtaking views from the mountaintops, and climbers from all over the world are constantly building new routes within the walls' infinite potential.
Downhill snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport based on sliding down a snow-covered surface using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting people skiing were created as early as 5000 BC!
"Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians in Australia opened the first ski club".
Backpacking: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer boots and skis.
Think of a ski slope as a trail similar to a nature hike.
Under good conditions, you can cover greater distances than you can on foot - but you will rarely match the speed of a backpacking cross-country skier on specially prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries requires going through the visa application process and passport control many times.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, operates a bit like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in the area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define goods as more than a hundred years old.
The definition has geographic variations, and the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products may be considered antiques, even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important to many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and kept reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami in the Sami area.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people".
If the country you are visiting receives a travel warning, it may affect your health insurance or flight cancellation insurance.
You should also consult other governments, but their advice is for their own citizens.

Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious disruption of social order or loss of life.
Severe weather can prevail anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.

Books and magazines on wilderness survival are plentiful, but publications on war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an X mark or documents updated to match the desired name and gender is changing.
The difference in the willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as great.
Security barrier inspections have also become much more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the scanners without having their privacy and dignity violated.
Rip currents are the return currents from waves breaking on a beach, often a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.

The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies about 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Asterias.
Others include Livingstone Island, and Dispatch, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano is still a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into a plain, then re-emerge to form the 220-mile-long Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which at 4,892 m (16,000 ft) is Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Usually a satellite phone is not a substitute for a cell phone, because you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by vessels, including cruise ships, as well as research expeditions that need remote data communication and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should provide you with further information on how to subscribe to this service.

In the archipelago of islands and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos of the coastal areas and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
It's similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but beyond that it's unique.
Most special Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It means you can visit the historic city for several full days and return to sleep on the ship at night.
If you come to the coast only by cruise, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises mention Berlin, Germany, in brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they've never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.

The obvious way to fly business or first class is to pay a large sum for the privilege (or better yet, make your workplace pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times as much for business class as for economy, and eleven times as much for first class!
In general, there's no point even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destinations quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.

In the same spirit, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.

Pre-modern observatories today are usually obsolete, remaining as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as nami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century AD.
