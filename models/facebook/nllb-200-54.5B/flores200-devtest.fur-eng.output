This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists suggest that the plumage of this animal was light brown above with a light undercoat or with carotenoid pigments.
The study also provides information about the evolution of plumage in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed root, called a backbone, but have other feather features (like barbels and barbules) the researchers inferred that the backbone probably developed later than the evolution of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but for temperature regulation or display.Researchers have suggested that, although the tail is from a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.
The researchers suggested that although the tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of Sagittarius galaxies.
The effect the team was looking for would have to be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, thus determining tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in much the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is made of many small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves inside a booth and place pre-printed paper ballots with their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
French electoral law codifies the procedure very precisely.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are inside when the ballot is cast and that no envelopes are added, except for those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and according to strict procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from his red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of beheading her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial but eyewitness evidence can be falsified, as her photograph has been widely published.
This practice is common throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the court found the publication of the photographs to be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "newspapers seem willing to cross a dangerous line by publishing photographs and other material of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for prosecutions, told reporters it would not comment further until an indictment had been filed.
According to news reports, the document will address the issue of borders that Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while Palestine opens a nominal presence for five years.
The shooters in the integrated pest control experiment had to be closely monitored by forest rangers while the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation between the NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sport Association (NSW Inc), qualified volunteers were selected as part of the Shooting Sport Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's deputy director of parks conservation and heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunt operation were trained and given comprehensive safety briefings.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the lack of elections, some of which have yet to be held as of 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods due to overheating have been recorded, with a total of six catching fire causing four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in communication from Apple "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 9:19 p.m GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no dams had been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no tsunami warnings.
A former Filipino policeman took a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shoots tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several obstacles have been cleared and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, had been released earlier, as well as Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced an elderly lady who needed the toilet, and Mendoza was executed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began work at Auckland Women's National Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that administration of a hormone accelerated fetal maturation of the infant's lungs.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders.
Other wrestlers have also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons, a unique thing just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even weirder...I love her to death and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place than this".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agreed and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents wanted Australia to become a republic as soon as possible and 31 percent wanted Australia never to become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her injuries her fitness was in doubt.
He was unable to take the painkillers he needed because they are banned by the courts.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number in history.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software on February 28 and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and thus support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have long since collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, became governor in October and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said the rumors were "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will help planes fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more precise information to pilots.
No other transport will be added and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking or interchange parking is not available.
Fears of a lack of transportation led to speculation that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study recently published in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
According to researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden, the species evolved in just two generations, although this process was expected to take much longer, due to interbreeding between a Darwin's frog (endemic species), Geospiza fortes, and the cactus frog (migratory species), Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes and can even be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thread until it can be twisted and twisted; it can be beaten or rolled into balls.
It could be made very thin and could be plated with other metals; it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade designs in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be created through the structure of the purple cap.
The structure of the cocoon changes color based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a coating.
Nearly every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes found in public baths, which were open to both men and women.
When calling someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest advantage the wheel has given us is that transportation has become much faster and easier.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below these are also medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are also many small cats (such as domestic cats) that eat much smaller and much more numerous prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, or special job that each cat has that does not put them in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Packs contain one to three related adult lions and up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
Males are usually closely related, as this is a large family of brothers and sisters.
Lion prides behave similarly to prides of wolves or dogs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats) and are deadly to prey.
A true athlete, the tiger can jump (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with a force five times that of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (or genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not as full as that of the lion but is more like a snarl, like when drinking.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and most of the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food animals (or prey) by scent, emerging on the ground where the animals are.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very slowly. Ocelots catch prey by blending into the environment and then jumping around the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population of origin (for example if they cross a mountain range or river or move to a new island from which it is difficult to return) they will find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different demands, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a good competitor to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, still requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Humans make homes and clothing using plants.Most human food is plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it lacked nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was studded with more than seventy sharp teeth, as well as numerous teeth in the roof of the mouth, so there was no escape from what or who was in front of it.
It is not known for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included crustaceans, crabs, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It also ate anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would have been no match for it.
Although much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual things to eat, such as turkey, peacock, quail, and a type of rodent called a vole.
Another difference was that while men and women ate their meals seated on chairs, women preferred to socialize in groups lying on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman diets may not have included foods that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever hunted turkeys.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods which was considered to be the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the special shrine of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, housing was not as important.
Much of Jewish family life revolved around food.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just empty benches facing the street.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so flax was very cheap.
Greenland was sparsely settled; the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each nation was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; although it is written somewhere after the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment of the document (which measures 293⁄4 ounces by 241⁄2 ounces) was made up of methyl vinyl.
So it is possible that the notation was added purely as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a single shared culture of a sufficiently large group of people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to Latin civis, meaning citizen, and a civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some ways also defining the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizing culture involves the passing of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and do not achieve recognition as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and since it was not a national executive or judiciary, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its laws.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be enacted, and the states so dominated the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, together with the Germany national football team, the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, ice dancing, speed skating, swimming, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's large number of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the islands' name as Formosa Island, meaning beautiful islands.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western Taiwan and its northern coasts and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Columns.
Most of the buildings on the flanks of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still-image photograph format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size until the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the ratio has been inherited by digital image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is somewhat inaccurate, in fact it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the easiest ratio in integers) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) share this ratio or are very close to it.
The widely used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under increasing scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the states of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipotence affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary resources should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led to many questions about whether this principle had been respected.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom imposed a naval embargo on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the embargo violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements of the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since it was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations were eager to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or ruling family was a characteristic dynasty.
In addition, between and after each dynasty was an unstable era of divided provinces, the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people killed fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, the occupations were opened to all male candidates allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same was true for the military because military ranks instead of being class-based were now ability-based.
The French Revolution also inspired many in the oppressed working classes of other nations to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The scroll itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountain ridge north of Mecca, the landri is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not even easy to find unless one knows that it exists; once inside the lander, it is completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear blue sky above and all the mountains looking down on it. Very little of the world is seen or heard within this land.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" symbol looks like a V and the "down arrow" symbol looks like a keyhole or a square without a bottom.
Up means start at the bridge and draw the bow, down means start at the bowstring (where the hand is holding the bow) and draw the bow.
An "upstroke" usually creates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to mark your marks in pencil, but note that the printed bow crossing symbols are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The terrorized King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of women from the market.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The riot forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point one of the marmalades decapitated one of the royal guards at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support much of their spending, and the interest on the bonds was transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
It was clear that the huge profits to be made from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people would be the primary advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events unfolded is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally dated to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a range of ideas, from technological determinism or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technologies themselves follows a path independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are innate, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is only economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new modes of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass motorization also leads to more road accidents, which leads to the development of new medical techniques to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, with writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Like Paris, which is now known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of light began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the crusaders returned bearing gifts such as chairs and drugs that were valued above what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the major developments of the period as a result of the Crusades was the widespread use of buttons on clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of food in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds sown in the native soil of the ecological region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers were employed in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disconnected from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the unfortunate few cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children were referred to as "wild" or feral.[citation needed] Some rescued children were kept indoors (usually by their parents); in some cases child abandonment resulted from the parents' rejection of a child with a severe physical or intellectual disability.
Rescued children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, rescued infants display behaviors almost identical (within physical limits) to those of the particular animal that raised them, such as its fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a helper that supports individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The platform can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of platform but can also be the little Microsoft Office guy.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are designed to ask questions, solve problems, and explain procedures that may be too difficult for the average user to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and nurturing, but it happens.
They do not perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is designed to provide for all the needs that are lacking in the home where the children were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet have led to an additional dimension to the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning"" and ""socialization"" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, movements of the face that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is counting kisses by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who are not good at understanding speech have damage to the brain, so they can accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes overt variation from the mix.
Segregation and recombination flip the variation back and forth between the two sets with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to match the demand for amino acids with available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be proteins from leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
Animal food (ants, termites, goats), on the other hand, is not only easily digestible, but provides a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of waking up suddenly from a normal sleep period and returning to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a sufficiently strong sedative to bring you to consciousness without unconsciousness.
If you happen to restore the light in the room, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to come out of the jet to study it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing yourself to wake up to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has within is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find total peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents us from achieving the goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they have been expanded upon by the Mahayana path of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity. Visualizing a variety of deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States; by the end of the war the clash of systems, processes, and cultures had led to the disunity of these nations.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought virtually, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the job of the marines was to ensure that their nation maintained the ability to move goods, while at the same time, interfering with the enemy's ability to move goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering the United Kingdom as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, fur, leather and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or young adults, similar to the better-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden rails, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than the slightly heavier roads of the time.
The sleepers were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place; however, it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had iron rails on them.
This became common practice, but iron was increasingly used for the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known means of transport is walking, humans began walking on two legs two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not routinely walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
One can begin to live more environmentally friendly lifestyles, join environmental movements, and even become an activist to reduce future suffering.
This is intended as symptomatic treatment in most cases; however, if only a temporary solution is not desired, then the root of the problem should be found and deactivated.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological developments, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed the following night, now known as the "Dunlap leaflets".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap manuscripts known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They had scaly feet and claws, laid eggs, and walked on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are generic enough to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term pudendal is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is based on an early familiarity with aphids, which are insects well suited to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and jet flies are nest-building insects, adapted to live in the nest or in the host's home.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In an adoption, the natural parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods; this method, in effect, drives most scientific research.
There is no need, however, for experimentation, and an experiment is evidence used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, including asking questions and making observations that guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific topics, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that carry forward a period of free-running cyclicity even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by either tagging the DNA in the bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the alteration in the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells were germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small rural villages to their workplaces and meet their employers at the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation sphere everyone in some way supports and is connected to a transportation system based on private automobiles.
Science now indicates that this large-scale carbon economy detached the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or outfalls are rarely heard in developed nations.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, why do they fail every other day, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly constant spectrum; thus, traffic flows tend to have a certain constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships aid the planning, design, and management of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air; their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This provides a greater selection of small hiding places for predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back over are flying squirrels and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some thought this was correct, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with bridges reaching up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size or technical excellence in their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were thousands of years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the most sparsely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most of those who work in the state where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as these can be found in nature in native forms and are fairly easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was most similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they move into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Note that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, as are metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
However, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lesser position and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Much like throwing a heavy rock up a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy immediately.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to split with little or no spin.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner below the seas and thicker below the plateaus.
They may have been deeper on the near side because the crust is thinner; it was easier for lava to come up near the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick or what pleases them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they mature into adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people that causes them to desire the things they want and what things in their environment will or will not cause them to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviours can arise when leaders suddenly start emptying their peers: On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or guys).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change whatever the group is doing and make it his or her own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are treated with the same level of excellence as conventional groups, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often function as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members as their group may meet in different time zones which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can unfold.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus narrowing and expanding the area of research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important area of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves creating machines for automatic functions that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and pattern recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are widely used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Often a teacher would be happy to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire a work of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol; each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as journals.
Blogs can also improve student writing. Students usually start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, but the audience usually changes.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to focus on improving the writing and avoiding criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to arouse public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as shape their own views on particular issues"" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital city and offers an assortment of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and further north is the Muskoka Highlands Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and beyond.
All of these things and more mark Ontario out as what is considered to be quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Larger areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wild and nearly uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations, or associated with France, and famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from the Cape to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any traveller state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It may also have a ring around it (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed, and so on.
You have to be firm in rejecting people, and it's not hard to stick to your guns (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt it as Daru I-Badya and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established their trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, ceramics, Korean goods, water pipes and a lot of toys, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the roads, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the situation of the ongoing conflicts in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest routes to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
Boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, though its reputation as a tourist attraction has improved, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
She was one of the longest-serving hosts of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the nation's cities, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered a diamond in the rough of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and entrance to the park.
It may be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission to either selected South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where most tourists think of as the main hub.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar graph that clearly shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is largely on reclaimed land along the coast to the north.
This is where the British settlers made their claim and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, extending for 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they include some of the last stands of the immense jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and there are now an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is best to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are compact and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two aisles 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the territory of other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen there at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is widely accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although they may accept British and American currencies; check with landlords first to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F) are common.
Summers can be insidiously cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combined air and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same year after year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, one must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how many mice they can catch, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not respect the proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s by the Dutch and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a naval disaster in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except for a single British cruiser; nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the beheading of the Tupua Tamasese ruler Chief Lealofi III.
There is a high volume of traffic, due to Auckland's proximity to two major ports; the busiest are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the sandy beaches are safe for swimming and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive stores are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly resorts, sometimes crowded, with a wide variety of shops along the waterfront.
The main local beer is 'Number one', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines fare better.
The local spring water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign; a short black is 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with full cream (not froth), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality; the apple sauce is expensive but delicious.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and reef-related injuries are rare.
However, heed the advice of authorities, obey all paperwork, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near streams and estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s, and sporadically outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans; most sharks are frightened of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include rides, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also block the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For high festivals, most music festival attendees choose to live on-site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to travel far to find a place to live near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, there may be other sections of the party that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Baltic from the north in winter, check the cabin position, as crossing ice can cause a rather horrible sound for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests; counters and clocks are usually absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drink and entertainment, to keep the guests happy, and to keep them in the venue.
Some establishments offer alcoholic drinks on the house; however, drunkenness impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of honesty.
Anyone wishing to drive to high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it is not as slippery as on paved asphalt.
Snow drifts in a short period of time can accumulate enough snow to block it.
Visibility may also be limited by drifting or blowing snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
Otherwise, ice and snow conditions are normal in much of the country, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris have become a major tourist attraction in Africa and a major activity for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and conventional equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, hiking, or bushwalking) consists of excursions, lasting anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and departure for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard ticket prices around ¥7,000.
Removing wet clothing can help with drying.Many hotels have a drying rack and drying table available for loan, although they are not included in the room rate.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not wish to use any of the above materials, then you can use a screwdriver, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to tighten, or in extreme cases burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, it is best to consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter noxious animals that are unfamiliar to them in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases can cause an allergic reaction, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Direct travelers to countries with high taxation can sometimes spend a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, frequently passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves predominate.
Indicated speed limits are much lower than in the front and rear sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is stronger than that at many other intersections, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite filling and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Apple pies are common, with apples baked in pies year-round, and cherries and plums on display during the summer.
Many foreign products also include almonds, walnuts, and other dried fruits, and the famous cakes often pair well with strong coffee.
If you want a small but filling dessert, try what is called berliner, pfannkuchen or crofe depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "sweet" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Java, now readily available throughout the archipelago, features a variety of plain cooked dishes, the predominant flavors preferred by the people of Java being eggplant, pepper, sugar (especially coconut sugar from Java) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that swing along either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can present safety concerns due to the possibility of a rider's foot becoming lodged in one.
If a rider jumps from a horse, but has a foot embedded in a stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize risk, safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a flat heel and a rather tight sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety rails that allow the rider to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley: the first climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and slopes.
The summits include breathtaking viewpoints, and climbers from all over the world keep breaking new ground thanks to the endless potential of its walls.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending steep slopes on snow-covered terrain on skis or with a breeze at your feet.
Skiing is the primary excursion activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski fanatics", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first amateur ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also called alpine skiing, ski jumping or ski touring.
It is related to, but does not always include, alpine style skiing or mountaineering, the latter practiced on higher ground requiring stiffer skis and boots.
He thought of the ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover longer distances than by walking, but only very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country running without a heavy pack on your shoulders.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one with many independent nations. Under normal circumstances, travel to many different nations would mean having to apply for visas and have one's passport checked many times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a nation in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if one has a Schengen visa, one does not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member nation separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of when industrial products are antiques; some tax agencies define antiques as items more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many with other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and so on, keeping reindeer more as land animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern commerce, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the warnings of governments other than your own, but their warnings are intended for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.

The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of storms, which can depend on geography, topology, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, fog, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, blizzards, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be very aware of any risk of bad weather in their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a nation that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the problems encountered but with a lot more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will typically last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, extensive first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in extreme environments are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery in the forest should make sure to bring valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undeclared (X) gender or with documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is also highly variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people prior to surgery should not expect to go through the scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return currents of waves breaking on a beach, often against coral reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current can form in deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As long as you get out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills or if you've been shot, you may want to wait for help.
Return shock occurs before culture shock (it is not a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had no trouble adapting to the new culture may find it very difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When he returns home after living in the forest, he has adapted to the new culture and has lost some of the customs of the native culture.
When visiting the forest for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
People may also not realize that they need to be patient and understanding with returning travelers as well.
The pyramid's light and sound show is one of the area's main attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in the city before the show starts.
Noise from tourists and traders is usually present, and The Story of Sound and Light is intended as a book of fables.
The Sphinx makes scenes and has a long history.
Scenes are shown on the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and are the islands with the most bases, with six active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the mainland, the largest island being King George Island, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the submerged remnant of an active volcano has become a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
There, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau and then rise again to form the 225-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern side, or Sentinel Range, is home to the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with Mount Vinson at 4,892 metres (16,000 ft).
In more remote areas, without cellular network coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as one must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is typically used by ships, including container ships, as well as expeditions requiring data and voice links to remote locations.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among those who wish to take a gap year after school is to travel and study.
This option is popular with high school graduates who wish to take a gap year before entering college without compromising their education.
Often, taking a gap year in the forest can significantly improve one's chances of entering a university upon returning home.
A university fee is usually required to enroll in these programs of study.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, a yacht is usually not needed.
While coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are usually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but remains rather unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises make a brief stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
You can then tour the historic city for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the ship at night.
Landing only on cruise excursions does not require an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises are shown in the brochures Berlin, Germany. As shown on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never been on a plane before or have had a traumatic experience.
Nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears or aversions to other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown and lack of control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering goods quickly; time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes the larger carriers had their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller carriers this was a problem.
If they were shipping by air, it could take days for some routes to clear customs.
The only way to get them there faster was to ship them as checked baggage; airline regulations did not allow a bag to travel without a passenger, which was necessary.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to charge a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it).
However, this choice will not be cheap: as a rough estimate, one can expect to pay four times as much for a business class ticket as for a normal economy fare, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts for first or business class seats on your way from A to B.
Airlines know that some travelers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member states.
Economic ties were re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The most widely practiced religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul and a highly efficient transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a thriving modern commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, stone-faced buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere closer to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has a church with an unusual octagonal shape.

The Scotturb 403 bus runs frequently to Sintra and also stops at Cabo da Roca.
Just to the north is the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous apparition site.
Note that you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a place of incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived these times are still alive, and many more had their throats cut or worked to death, Jewish and non-Jewish alike.
The site must be treated with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and no jokes about the Holocaust or Nazism are allowed.
The site should never be damaged by carvings or graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population is fluent in Catalan, most people understand it, and almost everyone is fluent in Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan, since by law it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are communicated through an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, mean-spirited, and demanding.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at home in Paris is to behave as well as possible, as a "well-mannered" person, and getting around the city will be much easier.
The rough appearance of the Parisians quickly disappeared if a little courtesy was shown.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered by forests, mainly beech, oak and beech, and currently has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a wide variety of plant communities, due to a range of microclimates, different soils, and different altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
It is home to rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, lynx, wild boar and red deer, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a knee-length skirt and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a shawl for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it is brightly coloured, the nun or monk at the entrance will make fun of you.
Along the same lines, men must also wear skirts that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but these clothes are not washed after each use, so they may be uncomfortable to wear.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, meat (especially pork) and the widespread use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any other available ingredients such as cheese, tuna and so on.
All nouns, as well as the polite pronoun "Sie", are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs from objects.
Perhaps this makes reading easier, but writing is often more complicated, because one has to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a noun form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
Particular attention should be paid to the letters C and G, as their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Care must also be taken to pronounce r and rr differently: "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "car".
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this grammar book will help you learn Persian grammar better and understand Persian sentences better.
Logically, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, a person with some knowledge of Spanish could very quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it should not be studied independently.
Today, pre-modern astronomical observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses, thus in more accessible locations than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Enjoying cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the flower of choice was the cherry.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy who visited the imperial court.

When visiting formal gardens specimens may not be picked up, for immediate expulsion without possibility of discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe city, easy to get around and where almost anything can be bought once you arrive.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, it must endure hot weather (usually) and sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).

Tradition has it that people spend the Easter night lying awake somewhere in the woods to watch the sunrise.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual dedicated to fertility and Virtue.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations meeting at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands travelled there by swimming, flying or gliding.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to cope with the journey, and giant tortoises became the primary grazing animals on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced such as goats, horses, cattle, panthers, cats, and dogs.
Visitors to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter may experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark most of the day.
Since the population of these regions is small and thus light pollution is not a problem, stars can be swallowed.
Work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than in Western cultures.
Fashion is the standard work attire and colleagues call each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is key and emphasis is placed on teamwork rather than individual performance.
Workers often must obtain permission from superiors before making a decision and must obey their superiors' directives without question.
