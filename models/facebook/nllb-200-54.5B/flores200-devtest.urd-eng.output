Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but it also provides details that fossils typically cannot, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was chestnut brown with yellow upper feathers or carotenoid underneath.
This research also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur pig's wing does not have a well-developed shaft, called a stump, yet it possesses other wing features - the sub-stump and the tip - the researchers concluded that the stump likely developed other features later in evolution.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for circulation or temperature expression. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and does not show the inner fin of a juvenile.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern indicates an adult and not a juvenile tail.

Most of the work performed was theoretical, but the program was written for a standard sample of observations made of the Milky Way galaxy.
The effects the team was looking for would be caused by tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
In the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth that creates tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy exists in the form of a halo around the galaxy, and is composed of many small particles.

In France, the voting process has traditionally been a less technical experiment: voters isolate themselves in the voting booth, mark the candidate of their choice on a pre-printed sheet of paper and put it in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.

Candidates have the right to send their representatives to monitor each component of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and according to specific rules.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of images to be potentially biased.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists who publish photos of suspects and so on are walking a dangerous line".
The Crown Office, which is overseeing all the proceedings, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the individual is charged.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine needs based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is respected by both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands that its military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
In the additional pest control trial the shooters are closely monitored by rangers as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Program in partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSWA) Inc.
According to McO'Flynn, who is the supervising director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) the previous day.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the early retirement of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to anti-government protests that began in October.
The failure to hold elections sparked periodic violent protests, with some elections pending since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the MITI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer takes Hong Kong tourists hostage on their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
The hostages, including children and the elderly, were soon released along with Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly woman who went for help.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained in Kabbalah and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he worked in a hospital, Lejeune began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager.
Dustin Goldstine" Runnels commented, "Luna was as passionate as I was...maybe more so. She had a huge heart and will be missed...hopefully in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a people's republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled believe Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the two extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in three relay events and the 100m and 200m freestyle events of the Commonwealth Games, but her health was called into question due to her complaints.
He is unable to take the medication he is supposed to take for pain relief because those medications are prohibited during those games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery in early February with the help of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have delivered organic material as well as water to the planet that could make proteins and support life.
There are also several federal service academies in the United States that train commissioned officers of the U.S. military who graduate with a bachelor's degree.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly shorter routes saving them millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the slightly older ground-based radar-based technology used by air traffic controllers to more skillfully identify aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No further transport is available and the overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parking and park and ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will be forced behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the birth of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolved in just two generations, though the process is thought to have taken longer, from the interbreeding of the native Darwin's finch, Giuseppina fortis, and the introduced I. cactus finch, Giuseppina coniferus.
Gold can be cast into all sorts of shapes; it can be made very small.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and knitted, which can be rolled into sheets and broken.
It could be made extremely thin, and adhered to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called the pH of chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level in the test chemical is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ion (the H in pH).
Hydrogen electrons are protons whose electrons separate them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands will react against the outer surface, creating a sensation of heat and forming a shell-like object.
Almost every household in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a developed sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Saturni in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. "In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a response and then immediately transmits it down to Earth.
Earth's atmosphere distorts our eyes' light and vision, so scientists use telescopes in space.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and for us, the biggest innovation of the wheel is providing fast and easy mobility.
It gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to bighorn sheep and deer.
Finally, there are small cats, including domestic cats, which eat a large number of common insects and rodents.
The secret to their success was the concept of the right place, the right person for the right job, which kept them competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of about thirty females and one to three related adult males with cubs.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, the women are usually very close to each other.
Groups of lions act much like groups of wolves or dogs, surprisingly the behaviours of the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats), and also that they are very deadly to their prey.
A well-built athlete, the cheetah can climb (not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human
The cheetah belongs to the lion, leopard, and jaguar group (genus Panthera).
A cheetah's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like an angry shout.
The plains leopard prefers to eat small animals. It will prey on monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if it can.
Scientists believe that leopards use their sense of smell and their sense of where they live to track prey and locate animals.
With night vision, they can see well in the dark and move about stealthily. The cheetah blends into its surroundings to attack and capture its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from a larger population (such as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island then they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different types of resources and different competitors, so the population will need different types of features or implementations to compete effectively than they did before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environment, they gradually start to look less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants give off the oxygen we breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make their food in sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs were the largest predators of their time, so they feared no one but other mosasaurs.
It had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth in its long jaws, as well as an extra set of teeth in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have a pointed tongue, a diet of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could even be an exotic animal.
Anything that entered the water was attacked, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't match it.
Although the Roman diet is familiar to us, it included some unusual ingredients, such as wild boar, peacock feathers, spinach, and cauliflower.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the nobles liked to have a banquet together where they could lie down and eat croquettes.
The table of ancient Greece could not contain the foods that would come from the Americas to Europe or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted elephant chicken.
The Babylonians had a central temple for each of their gods, which they viewed as the house of a god.
People brought offerings to God and tried to provide for God's needs during priestly ceremonies and festivals (nudballah).
Within each temple is an open courtyard and within it a sanctuary to which only priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the minaret was a special sanctuary for God.
In the hot climates of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most Christian families lived outdoors.
The store was an open counter facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had few forests, and wood was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found green grass and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country is "Scandinavian" in its own right, there are numerous differences in people, authorities, nobility, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might have guessed that there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom and top of the document.
While no one knew for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment scroll (which was 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage
So, it's likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
As a result of the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, the northern region of France was liberated, but the south was still not.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French (the puppet government of France). It was the French who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France in what was codenamed "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a particular group of people who live and work together in a cooperative manner, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning individual, which is related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and somehow describes the size of a society.
City-states are the news of the country. A civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge and arts for several generations, the establishment of a lasting cultural imprint and its proper propagation.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as their only component.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state officials, who often did not cooperate in enforcing all of its laws.
It also had no authority to overrule tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendment of these provisions required the unanimous consent of the States but the States were absent so mildly to the Central Government.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world along with the Germany national football team and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest island being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the collection of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is referred to as the "Sea of Japan" in geographical terms.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island as Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, and began to change indigenous grain production methods and employ Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and eastern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three man-made structures, including Anti Huatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists an accurate idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most popular film size until the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but most importantly, its aspect ratio comes from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format was originally 36 mm wide by 24 mm high, in a somewhat wobbly manner.
The aspect ratio (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) of this shape is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The often-criticized rule of thirds serves as the only guideline for creating movement while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective point of the principal subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the mirror into three parts vertically and horizontally.
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, came under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity held Europe together despite its different languages and traditions.
All of these dominant forces influenced everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are there specifically for that reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church had been in Rome, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval encirclement of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted norms of international law that had been established by international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the sea and thus endangered neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was very limited, Germany expected that unrestricted submarine warfare would have the same reaction.
The dominant attitude of most citizens and nations during the 1920s was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were determined to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City to work for the Edison Company.
Upon his arrival in the United States he had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each period or dynasty in China was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of provinces divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period between the Jurchen and Jin dynasties which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods there were fierce battles for the throne between many nobles.
In one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to democracy, nationalism and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution the vocations were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most optimistic and successful to succeed.
The same thing applies to the army because instead of ranking the army based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working class people in other countries to make their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave in Jabal "Nur" (Light) which became known as "Hara" for meditation.
His self-imposed seclusion in the cave, which lasted for periods, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual feelings.
This cave, located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find, because even if someone knows it's there, once you enter the cave, it's completely isolated.
Above, there was nothing but a clear, blue sky and lots of mountains. Very little of this world could be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third millennium B.C., is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), numerous small tombs, numerous temples, and Abu al-Hol.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The up bow mark looks like a V and the down bow mark looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you should start at the tip and press the bow and down means you should start at the frog (in which your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is more robust and firm.
Feel free to use a pencil in your markings, but remember that hidden arrows are caused by music, so they should be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister Madame Elisabeth were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
In a car on the way back to Paris, Tan was surrounded by a crowd who were chanting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a slain royal guard in front of the terrified queen at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
Those consumers paid taxes to the United States government in large part to pay the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
In fact, the high profits gained through the long exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main benefits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it's important to understand the context that led to the creation of this system.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages and then the Early Modern Period, which ended collectively around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of theories in practice ranging from a progressive orientation toward technology or the obsession with modern technology to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common theories: that technological development itself follows a path that transcends civilizational or political influence, and that technology in turn produces effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile essentially paves the way for road improvements.
However, it is not economically viable to build a nationwide road network for just a few cars, so new production methods have been devised to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Large-scale car ownership also leads to high accident rates on the roads, leading to the development of new technologies in the health sector to repair damaged parts.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural commitment, derived from writers such as Goethe, Gottlieb Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time the traditions and cultures that were associated with that geography, and that were consistent with the space of society, were better than the rules of settlement.
In the same way that Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
This is known as the Axis of Luxury, which began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
The main reason for its decline in the 12th century was that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than the price offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication systems, the Western way may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was the popularization of the practice of using buttons to fasten the clothing of crusaders.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted solely for the purpose of providing food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that maximizes yield by using locally protected seeds from the ecosystem in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and empower them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by using distinctive and symbolic styles, body fashions, particular styles, and colloquialisms.
One of the most common methods used to highlight social significance is to identify a few unpleasant events in children during their upbringing, in which they were ignored, unfortunate or deliberately abused by adults, not allowed to participate in social activities.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or feral children. Some feral children are confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's serious mental or physical disability causes the parents to reject the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma from being abandoned or running away.
Others were reportedly raised by animals; some were reported to be living on their own in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human organisms, feral children exhibit (within psychological limits) almost entirely domesticated animal-like behaviors such as fear of or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, guided learning techniques facilitate a step further.
Its folding is not a way to learn, but it helps people who are going through a new learning experience like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
His folds can be both virtual and physical -- in other words, a teacher is a version of his fold, but so is the little man with the paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are installed internally in the software. Their purpose is to question, persuade and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, exploitation, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing and educational, but people do.
We think of the child care system as a safety zone for these kids.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster care aims to meet all the needs that were not present in the home from which they were brought.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinguishing characteristics of the Internet are that it takes on an additional angle in terms of usability and satisfactory methodology.
For example, "learning" and "social behavior" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James, 1995).
When Agee and McCord (1998) investigated audience responses to the website, they also identified "personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" as new motivational dimensions.
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, and facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can tell if they are lying by correctly presenting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The Presidential Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some of the same abilities to interpret human behavior can be found in pets such as dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
In each generation, variation went back and forth between the two groups, separating and mixing.
It is difficult for a langur with a human-like digestive system in the great outdoors to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so can have dangerous consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available sources of plant protein are the leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for creatures like us to digest until they're ripe.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also high in protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that langurs do today on the open plains.
Going to sleep at your normal sleep time and then going back to sleep (within 10 to 60 minutes) is a deliberate act.
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock in your sleep, it may be moved to the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, due to increased urination) before bedtime, forcing one to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner satisfaction correlates with the amount of stress in their body and mind.
The less stress there is, the more positive life force there is. Everyone has the power to find total peace.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of total acceptance of love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and concepts with kundalini yoga.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. The concept of various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras and creates enlightened consciousness.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, paving the way for cooperation between Russia and the United States. At the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the destruction of nations.
Two years after the war ended, former allies turned on one another, and the Cold War began.
This war reportedly lasted for 40 years and was fought by proxy armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize on the foundations of Romania.
However, these plans were abandoned overnight when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the seas.
The traditional function of the Navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its own people and supplies, while at the same time, preventing your enemy's ability to move your people and supplies.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans were attempting to send men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
However, the German Navy mostly used U-boats to try to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have taken over Britain as it had taken over the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and fur.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the mountains and pastures. They were usually supervised by herdsmen, who were usually young children and adolescents, similar to the familiar herdsmen.
Wagonways were built in Britain in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them faster and carry slightly more weight on the poor roads of the period.
Cross ties were used in the early days to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was discovered that the rails were more efficient if they were topped with an iron step.
This became a common practice, but because of iron, wooden car wheels began to be more decorated.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The earliest mobility was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Specializations in bipedalism in Australopithecus fossils date to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, while coelenthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become active participants in reducing future suffering in some way.
It's like a symptomatic treatment in many situations, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and stop it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically as a result of mankind's scientific and technological achievements and the problems created by population growth and mankind's increasingly luxurious lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight in what is now known as the "Dunlap Broadside".
The first reading of the document took place on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall by John Nixon.
A letter was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the document in existence; the original has been lost.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today -- we call them birds.
A lot of people don't recognize them as dinosaurs because they had wings and they could fly.
But there's a lot more to these dinosaur-looking reptiles.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit has one or two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as nausea are so common that immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open bottle of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of terrestrial insects.
The term derives from the paleontology of bed bugs, which are insects that parasitize humans.
Killer bugs and bed bugs are both classics, taking up residence in their host's nest or home.
There are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease of adolescents and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or not in the best interests of their child.
These couples will have to choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The specific goal of scientists is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific inquiry.
That alone is not enough, an experiment is a test or trial by which one or more hypotheses are disproved, questions are formulated, observations are recorded and scientific research is guided.
Physicists and philosophers focus on ancient texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language declined, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many people observe that rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of circadian cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to some external periodic cue have been noted for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue a freely rotating cycle period in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was the most important in explaining the genetic material of DNA.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to transplant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to either make phage DNA from radioactive phosphorus or phage protein from radioactive sulfur.
Depending on its species, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells, the mutation can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the sights, including flora and fauna wildlife.
Examples of informal activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about ecosystems.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about the Virungtangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small towns across the country leave for work by car, trailing behind those whose workplace is where they just left it.
Everyone in this mobile transportation shuttle is connected to each other, supporting a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this carbonaceous economy has stripped the planet of one of its most stable qualities that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in society uses the transportation system, but surprisingly, almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries you occasionally hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation organizations generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is very difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately drivers want to behave within appropriate constraints; thus traffic lanes have some degree of stability and can be represented somewhat mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characters: (1) flow, (2) density, (3) and (4)
These relationships help in the planning, design, and activation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first organisms to be transported through the air. Their ability to fly helped them eliminate enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their feathers or wings back onto their bodies.
This gives them a large range of small places to hide from wild animals.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth. It carries eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest surface river on Earth, some six miles wide.
Twenty percent of all the water that leaves the planet's rivers and enters the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long.
Although the construction of pyramids from stones continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids built at Giza have no answer in terms of their volume and construction quality.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since prehistoric times, because these elements can be discovered in their original form in the physical world and can be mined with relatively primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was very much like the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they could change into new substances that we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also take mixed metals that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atomic particles are so incredibly small that they could fit trillions of them into the space at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was invented, it became the best friend of many people.
Sadly, with the invention of new writing systems, the pencil's status and use has declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, they never have to go near a sharpener.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
An explosive bomb (fission bomb) works on the principle that a nucleus is an atom with its own protons and neutrons due to nuclear energy.
It's like pushing a heavy rock up a hill, and then splitting the nucleus releases some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can break apart with little or no shaking.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer surface of the Moon is called the mantle.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin below the maria and thick below the highlands.
There may be volcanic-like rocks near the rim because the rim is very thin and it is easy for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what people want and like.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized as they move toward adulthood.
These theories discuss what factors cause individuals to do what they do and what objects in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's theory of requirements and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two attitudes can emerge in managers when managing their former colleagues. One side of the picture is that he is trying to "remain one of the boys (or girls)".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, reviewing performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the picture, a person transforms himself into an unrecognizable person who feels the need to completely change and make up for the work done by the team.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this attitude creates rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are bound by the same standards of existence as established teams, but there are subtle differences between the two.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons for their immediate physical group.
They have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones that their local administration may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larsen & LaVasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing organizational learning? One goal of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and skill arise when all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization.
The resulting process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to an innovative innovation process to meet a customer need.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) defines the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach high standards of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical mechanisms of consciousness research, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more open.
Connections between brain pathology and individual behavior help scientists investigate them.
It has long been known that a variety of brain injuries, traumas, injuries, and disorders affect human behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technological developments allow us to see and investigate brain structures and functions that we could never see before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to establish stimulation models that help us to understand the mechanisms in our mind.
Although AI is a strong proponent of science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and machine intelligence.
AI research involves building machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer assessment and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become discrete disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays AI systems are often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military field, as numerous home computer and video game software applications have been created.
Field trips are an extensive part of any classroom. Often a teacher will want to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips.Students can sit in their classrooms and see rare museum specimens, tour the aquarium or admire beautiful artworks.
Participating in a virtual world field trip is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital. Every year the website is redesigned, but the old version is kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Students start their blogs with grammar and spelling mistakes, which are corrected by a community of blog readers.
Since students are usually subject to criticism, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to create interest in the readers (audience) encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and promotes students' ability to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical. By actively using content on the Internet, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own perspective on a particular case (O'Rourke, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and home to numerous art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north Muskoka and beyond are areas of infinite beauty.
All of these things and more define Ontario as what outsiders perceive as more advanced Canadian.
Further north, a large area is sparsely populated and some is almost uninhabited forest.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African island is in the Indian Ocean and is off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is huge, and when it comes to wildlife, it's a giant in its own right.
Formerly small islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
He also brought Islam to the Arabian Peninsula, and worked extensively in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north it is bordered by the coast and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers identify themselves as married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not just the one that looks too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what they consider normal behaviour, such as following someone, holding someone's arm, etc. not being abnormal.
Be firm about forbidding men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Merinds under the name of Infa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco as Dar al-Badiya and renamed Casa Blanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least favourite places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the ancient city of Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items such as altajins, pottery, leather goods, tricks, and all kinds of toys, but all these things are only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a tracking outpost for some of the fiercest mountain gorillas in Africa as well as climbing Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Goma you can use a Boda Boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (regional) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
In contrast, the inaccessible name "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for a foreign, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor area, although its reputation makes it a popular tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main attractions to see during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which is conducive to a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the centerpiece of the South African National Parks (SAN Parks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has daily protection and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous for one to purchase a wildcard, which provides admission to a selection of South African parks or to all national parks in South Africa.
The Hong Kong region is named after Hong Kong Island and is a place that many tourists consider as their tourist destination.
The rows of buildings that line Hong Kong's skyline have taken the form of a shimmering bar chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to its opposite Kowloon Waterfront.
A large number of Hong Kong Island's urban developments are located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British imperialists made their home and so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coastal region to the remote hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sunderbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the Sunderbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include the last few remaining patches of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third are wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 giraffes in the area.
Buses run throughout the day between the bus stations (across the river) located in each other's districts, although especially those heading east and Jakkar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most prefectures have small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are faster and more comfortable to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (No. 150) and Panacha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of São Jorge de "Oyapock" in Brazil and French Guiana.
The height of the two towers is up to 83 meters, and they are 378 meters long and its two lanes are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The tunnel is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers in what is now eastern Paraguay, who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Goicero and the Payagua, who made their living through hunting, gathering and fishing.
16th century AD Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the struggle with the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous indigenous communities.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
After the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay was able to maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Los Cañatas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards from the outer islands are unlikely to be accepted, although UK, European and US currency may be accepted; check with landlords in advance to determine an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winters can be surprisingly cold: temperatures occasionally drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make the weather much colder than the cold shown on a thermometer.
There is no fixed time for the "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild animals that should not be fed or teased.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife!
Despite how gentle they may seem on the surface, bison, rhino, moose, bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep their distance.
Also, remember that foul-smelling food attracts bears and other wildlife. So avoid bringing in or cooking food that smells bad, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Pearl Harbor was the site of an infamous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk; about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of Paramount, Topua Tamasese Lilufi III.
Auckland is located on the edge of two bays, so there are a number of beaches. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) is located on the Atlantic Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They're almost all sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and mostly in the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is located on the beachfront Waitemata Harbour in the Balamandi suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers is located in Central Auckland.
Sometimes these families are tropical herders and there are a large number of shops on the beach.
The specialty local beer is called "Number One", it is not dirty beer but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, however New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're scared, bottled water is also readily available.
The concept of "flat coffee" is unfamiliar to Australians. Short black is 'espresso', cappuccino is coffee with more cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The fruit juice is expensive but good.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
Still, consult authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near coasts and riverbanks north of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally be seen outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being the River Jarrandham north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that accommodation will be arranged once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals or offers for specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or a combination of hotel and ship.
If you take time to think about the offer or other documentation for your destination (such as a visa), they may also block your reservation.
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the sheer number of attendees that were at the music festivals, they decided to camp there and most of the attendees made it a big part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you'll have to get there early to get a spot at the campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that the music may have ended on the main stage, but there are many parts of the festival where the music will continue late into the night.
Some festivals have special areas for families and young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because there is a very scary sound when crossing the ice, which is scary.
A St. Petersburg cruise includes leisure time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos actually go to great lengths to maximize time and money spent by guests.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them staying at the place.
However, drinking impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or over hills should be aware of possible snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and icy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a severe blizzard, the amount of snow that can trap you falls in a very short time.
You can't see anything because of falling or flying snow or thick or icy car windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy seasons are common in many countries, and travel is often unhindered throughout the year.
Safaris are arguably the center of high-end tourism in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
In common parlance, a safari refers to a journey overland to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the wildlife of the green plains.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and are best seen with standard equipment.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are generally shy, and you will be able to see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") is a hike of a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at various venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face critical circumstances.
Cancellation policies vary, but most do not extend the coronavirus-based policy from late March until July 2020, when the decision was made to cancel the Olympics.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with exceptional tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels provide free ironing and ironing boards if you don't have one in your room.
If ironing is not available and you do not wear socks that are not ironed, try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat your clothing (otherwise it will shrink or burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in other places, it takes many minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should be concerned, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter hazards from animals unknown to them in their home regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause inflammation, or in extreme cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or cause infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people with their force, are generally not considered epidemics.
Duty-free shopping allows you to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at designated locations.
Reasonable amounts of money can sometimes be saved by obliging travelers from other countries to pay heavy taxes, especially on tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
The stretch between Point Marine and Fairmount makes driving on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway difficult, frequently passing through the middle of an isolated interior woodland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: these roads are prone to bumps, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The prescribed speed limit is significantly lower than for the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and its strict adherence is even more important.
Interestingly, the cell phone service here is much better than many other parts of the route, such as the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good and there is a lot of variety and richness in Bavaria, like in our southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples added to pastries all year round and cherries and berries showing their faces during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, walnuts and other tree nuts. The popular cake often pairs particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but exquisite pastries, try the regionally known Berliner, Fenkuchen or Rapfen.
Curry is a dish made from meat or vegetables with spices and herbs.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" based on the amount of liquid content.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, curd is commonly used in khichdi; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine of the 17,000 islands is a term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifier, the term refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern regions of the island of Java proper.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the island, is a variety of seasonal dishes, with popular flavors of peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The handlebars are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
It provides the rider with more stability but also has the risk that the rider's foot may get caught in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in the saddle, he may be dragged when the horse runs away. Several safety measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots that have a high heel, smooth, fairly tight and sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that, if pulled from behind by a falling rider, causes the rider's leather to separate from the saddle.
Cochamo Valley - the best place for mountaineering in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has a variety of large granite or limestone walls and rocks.
Climbers from all regions of the world are constantly striving to carve new routes between its endless series of walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are the most popular sports in which athletes slide downhill on snow-covered rocks with skis or snowboards on their feet.
Skiing is a major tourist attraction, with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski boomers", planning to spend their entire vacation skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has a long history - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking: Also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but generally does not include alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on sloped terrain and requiring more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail the same way you think of a hiking or walking trail.
In good condition you'll be able to cover more distance anyway than walking - but rarely will you be able to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but there are a large number of independent countries. Travelling to multiple countries in normal circumstances means you have to apply for visas and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area operates more or less like a country in this respect.
As long as you live in the region, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you do not have to apply separately for each Schengen country's visa, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes a rare artifact. Some tax agencies consider artifacts more than 100 years old to be rare.
There are geographic variations in interpretation, where the age range may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, though they are inferior in age to similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is the main source of livelihood for the Sami people and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many people associated with other professions.
Even the traditional, though not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding but they lived on fishing, hunting animals and so on, kept the reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, the word "gypsy" is often perceived as offensive, especially by non-Roma, due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of the Romani people.
If you will be visiting a country where travel advice is conditional, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.

Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to be able to communicate with scanners with their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return flows of waves that end up on beaches that are often rocky or similar.
Due to the underwater topology the reversal velocity is concentrated in a few deep sections, and strong currents can be generated in deep water.
Most of the deaths are the result of fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming is not as easy as it used to be.
Try to aim where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skill, whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait to be rescued.

Generally speaking, there is no reason to consider discounts for business or first class on direct flights from one place to another.
Airlines know that certain groups of air travelers are willing to pay more dollars to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
