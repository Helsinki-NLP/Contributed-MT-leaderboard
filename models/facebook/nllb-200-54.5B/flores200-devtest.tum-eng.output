In the PALM trial program, Zmapp was the comparator, meaning that the researchers put it first and compared it with three other drugs.

This supports the idea that dinosaurs had scales, an idea that has long been promoted but that has not been supported by fossil evidence, such as color and three dimensions of body size.
Researchers believe that the creature had a brown upper body and a black or yellow underbelly.
The findings also shed light on the evolution of feathers over the centuries.
Since dinosaur shells do not have a central ridge, called a rachis, but instead have a special type of shell - one with a very small central ridge and very few lateral ridges - researchers theorize that all other shells evolved into shells with a central ridge.
The shape of the dinosaur's scales suggests that they were not used for flight but, rather, as a means of supporting the animal's weight and keeping it warm.
Researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the fossil evidence indicates that the scales are those of a full-grown dinosaur, not juveniles.

Israel wants a 10-year military presence in the valley if an agreement is reached, while Palestinian officials agree to a five-year agreement.
Additional gunners were trained by game wardens, while traps were set up for the purpose.
In cooperation with the NPWS and the National Shooting Sport Federation of Australia (NSW), volunteer shooters were recruited under a pilot program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, director of conservation and historic preservation with the NPWS, the four shooters initially selected for the program received adequate protection and training.
Martelly appointed a new nine-member Central Electoral Commission (CEP).
This is Martell's fifth election in four years.
Last month a presidential campaign group suggested that the electoral commission should downgrade the status as a way of pushing the country to new elections.
The presidential communications team criticized Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.

Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as amazing as me...maybe more...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of more than 1,400 people taken before Australia's 2010 parliamentary election, the number who disapproved of the president's policies increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated at a campaign rally for the 2010 parliamentary election that she believes Australia should be ruled by a president when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of those polled wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the close of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should have a president immediately, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not have a president at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events and to compete in three Commonwealth Games, but apparently he could not compete because of a physical disability.
He was unable to take painkilling drugs because they are banned in the sport.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime - a number that is divisible only by itself and 1.
In early February, after a series of tests using published literature and computer programs, the number was published on a Tuesday.
The rising stars may have delivered to earth the water and nutrients needed to sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, including the formation of the earth itself, by studying the impact of massive stars on the earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.

According to the FAA, the NextGen program will help airlines fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce air pollution.
The project uses satellite navigation systems to replace older ground-based navigation systems, enabling air traffic controllers at airports to track planes more accurately and to give pilots more accurate information.
No alternative transportation is planned, and local trains will not stop at Wembley, nor will there be any parking or storage facilities for buses or trains.
Fears that public transportation would be cut off led to speculation that the games might be held behind closed doors, with no fanfare.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the discovery of a new species of birds in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University, in the United States, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, report that in just two generations a new species - previously thought to have developed over aeons of time - has been created by the hybridization of the endemic Darwin's and Sitche's finches and the migrating cactus finches.
Gold can be shaped into almost any shape or size.
It could be rolled up into a small sheet, woven and knotted, or wrapped and folded in a flat sheet.
It was made in flat sheets, attached to one another by metal clasps, and was sometimes used to enhance the beauty of illuminated manuscripts.
You can use the juice of red cabbage to test various drugs.
The juice of the cabbage plant changes color depending on whether the solution is acidic or alkaline.
The pH scale is a measure of the amount of Hydrogen (H at pH) in a solution.
The hydrogen atom is made up of protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen molecules have one proton and one electron).
Stir the mixture together, and then with clean, damp hands, roll the mixture into a ball.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the movement of the ball, causing you to smile and the ball to move.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, which channeled sewage through a system of overhead pipes.
The earliest indoor plumbing was found in Minoan houses on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptian, Persian, and Chinese baths were similar, and Roman baths were sometimes open-air baths where men and women bathed together without being separated.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in the sky receives your voice and instantly transmits it back to earth.
Astronomers use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere blocks out some of the light and interferes with our view of the universe.
It would take a spacecraft more than 100 feet [30 m] long to lift a satellite or a telescope into orbit.
The tire has changed the world in amazing ways, not the least of which is that it has made travel easier and faster.
He has made possible railways, automobiles, and other forms of transportation.
Among these are medium-sized rodents that feed on larger animals, such as rabbits, deer, and antelope.
Finally, there are the many tiny insects (including beetles) that feed on countless tiny creatures, such as insects, rats, cockroaches, and birds.
The secret of each ant's survival lies in its own defense mechanism, a unique feature that enables the ant that carries it to survive in a hostile environment.
Lions are gregarious animals, living in huge herds called prides.
A pride may have from one to three adult males in a pride and up to 30 females and cubs.
Usually, these lionesses are related, forming a large family that includes older brothers, sisters, and cubs.
Herds of lions mimic the behavior of wolves or hyenas, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but different from other large cats) in their ability to move and in their aggressiveness toward their prey.
The tiger, an accomplished athlete, can climb a tree (despite limited athletic ability), leap, jump, and pull with a force five times that of a strong man.
The leopard is a member of the genus Panthera, along with the lion, the leopard, and the cheetah.
The leopard's roar is not the loud roar of a lion but sounds like a full-throated war cry.
The leopard's diet consists mainly of small animals, such as lizards, snakes, mice, and birds - almost all of which are much smaller than the leopard.
Scientists theorize that owls track and locate their prey by scent, scratching the ground for clues.
To hunt their prey, owls often adapt to their surroundings and then swoop down to attack their prey.
When a relatively small group of organisms becomes separated from the main body of an ancestral species (such as by moving across mountains or rivers, or by moving to an uninhabited island), the result is often a dramatic departure from the original life pattern.
With new sources of food and increased competition, the new arrivals may need to develop new skills or adapt to new ways of doing things in order to survive in a more competitive environment.
Remaining unchanged, the organization must continue to evolve as it did in the past.
Over time, as this new group adjusts to this new way of life, it gradually becomes distinct from the mainstream.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become so different that they no longer seem to be a single species.
We call this whole process speciation - the production of new species - and it is an inevitable and important part of the process of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere).
By means of photosynthesis, plants convert sunlight into food and shade.
We rely on plants to make our homes, our clothes, and most of our food; without them, animals would die.
Mosasaurus was the most fearsome predator in the fossil record, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
With more than 70 razor-sharp teeth along the length of its lower jaw and many more along its upper jaw, the marabou is a formidable predator.
We do not know for sure, but it likely had a forked tongue, and it ate amphibians, large fish, jellyfish, and possibly humans.
It also had a remarkable ability to hold fast to anything that came within reach of the water; a feat equaled only by the T. rex.
Although many of their dishes may have contained quail, the Romans shared some unusual foods or feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, ostriches, and dormouses
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals on couches, the rich often had banquets together where they could relax and enjoy their food.
Ancient Roman food did not come to Europe from the Americas or Asia just a few decades ago.
For example, he did not eat wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ate beans.
The Babylonians built temples that resembled the homes of their gods.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests attended to the needs of the deities by performing rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had a walled courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped sacred towers, called ziggurats, flanked the houses of the gods.
At the top of the pyramid was the sanctuary of the deity.
In the hot climate of the ancient Middle East, houses were cheap.
Much of Hebrew family life centered on the family circle.
Women cooked in the open air; market stalls toppled their countertops; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was forested, and timber was a scarce commodity.
According to Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled westward, he found green land and named it Greenland.
But his findings aside, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country had its own Scandinavian flavor, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had distinct peoples, rulers, cultures, and histories.
Watching the movie National Treasure might make you think of the treasure map on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.
On the other hand, a false map, although it has writing on the back, is not a map to real places.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, dated July 4, 1776".
While the writer of those words is unknown, it is evident that in Bible times, a large leather roll (about 11 by 10 inches [29 by 24 cm]) was used as a safe deposit box.
Hence, it is unlikely that the passage was inserted merely as an introduction.
The first day of the Allied landings in Normandy and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but southern France was still under siege.
It was ruled by "Vichy" French, French citizens who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the invaders against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched Operation Gragoon, an invasion of northern France.
Within two weeks, American and French troops liberated southern France
A civilization is a group of people with distinctive characteristics who live and work together.
The word 'civilization' is derived from the Latin word 'civilis' meaning common people of a country, which corresponds to the words 'civis', meaning citizen, and 'civitas' meaning city or town.
Cities of refuge give birth to cities of refuge, communities of refuge give birth to communities of refuge, and communities of refuge give birth to communities of refuge.
Small groups of people gradually lose their identity and disappear without leaving a trace, preventing them from being recognized as distinct groups that existed at a particular time and place.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies formed the first federal government - the Continental Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and in the absence of a legislative or judicial branch, Congress relied on the states' governors, who often disagreed on how to enforce their laws.
It also had no power to change customs laws or to levy taxes.
The charter required the unanimous consent of all the states before it could be amended, and the states ignored the government so much that their representatives were seldom present.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful national football team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and auto racing are among the most popular sports in the Western world.
Skiing is popular in Europe, and Italians have competed in international championships and the Olympics.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands - of which Honshu is the largest - making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the collection of islands that Japan possesses, in a geographical sense, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origin can be traced back to the 16th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the southeastern coast of Taiwan, introduced a new crop rotation system and hired Chinese laborers to work their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized Taiwan's eastern and northern coasts and proclaimed Taiwan the seat of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing leadership signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures - Intihuatana, the temple of the sun, and the Hall of the Three Columns.
Many of the structures found at the end of the pyramid are designed to give visitors a good idea of what the original structure looked like.
By 1976, thirty sections of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most popular movie camera is the 35 mm movie camera, which was huge in the late days of film.
It is still produced today, but it is not as widely used as its paperless counterpart.
The 35-millimeter film, which is 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high, is somewhat confusing.
The ratio of width to height of this image (divided by 12 to get the smallest ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Most image formats (APS format, for example) match or fall close to the minimum and maximum aspect ratios.
A rule of thumb that is often misapplied and underestimated is the rule of thirds, which dictates that an image should be enlarged in order to emphasize the main idea.
According to this law, the best place to insert the main message of an image is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts, each of which is terminated by a vertical line and a horizontal line.
The Catholic Church, the wealthiest and most powerful institution in Europe at the time, was being challenged.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian congregation has helped to unite European nations across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
Their rule affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
The basic Christian belief is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that this is the main purpose of church contributions.
With its headquarters in Rome for over a thousand years, the church's influence and financial resources raised doubts about the sincerity of its beliefs.
In the early days of the war, Britain used naval blockades and blockade runners to deny the Germans vital supplies.
The blockade served its purpose, halting the flow of both military and civilian goods, even though it violated international laws and treaties that had been adopted during the preceding century.
Britain installed an international system of coastal batteries and a naval blockade, which threatened even civilian shipping.
Since there was little response to this plan, the Germans waited for word from their navy.
During the 1920's, the thinking of many peoples and nations was that war was an inadequate means of settling disputes and promoting isolation.
After witnessing the horrors of war and the atrocities of the first world war, the nations were determined to make sure that such atrocities would never happen again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with his four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of marking the passing of time; each Chinese era or dynasty was a distinct kingdom.
The most famous of these was the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms Period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
This period was marked by bitter struggles between powerful leaders vying for supremacy.
The dynasty was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands dying in a struggle for the throne at the imperial court in Xi'an.
Many social and political changes followed, including the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures, the shift from dictatorship to democracy, the promotion of patriotism and nationalism, and the belief that the world belongs to all rather than to any one ruler.
Moreover, after the reform, employment opportunities were opened up to men who were willing and qualified to apply.
The same was true in the military, where experience rather than personality was now the norm.
The French Revolution also emboldened the foreign workers who were expected to join the revolution.
Muhammad's mind was on higher things than the mundane worldly life. He used to go to a cave called "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The actual cave, which has long since disappeared, gives an indication of Muhammad's spiritual devotion.
Located on a hilltop to the north of Mecca, the cave is isolated.
It is not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing beats the clear blue sky above the surrounding mountains, and there is not much to see or do inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the world's largest pyramids built in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), numerous smaller pyramids, temples, and a colossal Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and dozens of smaller pyramids, pagodas, and temples honored Khufu's wives and concubines.
The upstroke resembles a V, and the downstroke resembles a paper clip or a falling figure that is the same height and width but has no bottom edge.
High means start at the end and push the stick, and low means start at the end of the stick (with your hand holding the stick) and pull the stick.
Pushing a violin upward produces a low sound, whereas pulling it downward produces a high sound.
You can use a pencil to write your own musical notation, but keep in mind that the written notes for the violin are for harmonic purposes and should be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced by a guru of market women to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
As they traveled back to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage, they were surrounded by an angry mob shouting threats against the Duke and Duchess.
The mob forced the King and Queen to bleed on the car windows.
Perhaps one of them bravely raised the severed head of the royal guard at the Palace of Versailles in front of a horrified and bewildered Empress.
The cost of the U.S. occupation of the Philippines after the war was borne almost entirely by Filipinos.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. occupation authorities and to pay interest on U.S. debt secured in the name of the Philippines by Wall Street banks.
Yes, the huge profits made from the robbery of Filipinos are the real source of U.S. influence abroad.
To understand the footwear of the Crusaders, one must understand the origins of footwear.
This period in European history is known as the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.
A period of European history in the 18th century, followed by a period of European history from the late 15th century to the late 16th century.
The term "scientific social influence" can refer to a number of concepts, including the belief that scientific discovery is essential and that human well-being is dependent on scientific laws and scientific achievements.
The term "social science" is often defined in two ways: as the application of scientific findings to social or political issues, and as the application of scientific knowledge to human affairs.
For example, someone may say that since cars were invented, there will always be roads.
Of course, when there are few cars in a country, having more roads does little to boost the economy, so new methods of transportation are developed to reduce costs.
As the number of cars increases, so do the number of accidents, which in turn increases the need for emergency medical services to care for the injured.
The eclecticism of art, literature, and music that characterized the late 19th century was part of a broader trend toward moral relativism promoted by such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Through identity and the arts, such as painting, literature, and music, the social environment shaped human nature, and over time, cultural norms and values developed that, in turn, adapted to the culture and environment, becoming more sophisticated than rigid rules.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
From the fifth century C.E. to the 11th century C.E., this region was known for its prosperity.
Their fortunes began to decline in the 12th century as the crusaders brought gifts of cloth and spices that were more costly than those available in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the center of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic culture reached its zenith in the 11th and 15th centuries.
At first, the style was influenced by Byzantine styles from the East.
Even so, because of the lack of high-speed communications, Western civilization lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, when Western Europe was undergoing a cultural renaissance sparked in part by the Crusades, people began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
A small-scale farmer is one who cultivates only enough food to feed himself and his family.
Growing crops and raising livestock is a simple process, often involving the use of fertilizers and the use of locally stored seeds in combination with crop rotation or other simple techniques that produce good yields.
Historically, most farmers grew crops and raised livestock for food, and this is still true in many developing lands.
New cultures are being formed by like-minded people who see the vanity of popular values and who want to feel important and unique.
New customs may vary according to age, race, economic status, geographic location, and/ or gender.
The factors that lead to cultural differences may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, environment, or a combination of these.
Immigrants are often recognized by their unusual and distinctive customs, including the way they dress, behave, and speak.
One of the most common ways in which the need for contact is highlighted is by the sad plight of children who grow up without adult supervision or supervision because of neglect, abuse, or neglect.
Some are deprived of their independence (often by their parents); others are abandoned, perhaps because of parental neglect or abuse.
In some cases these unsuspecting children may have suffered horrific abuse as children or may have been emotionally or physically traumatized even before they ran away from home.
Some of the children were said to have been raised by animals; others were said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised exclusively by animals rather than by humans, a feral child develops characteristics (including defects) that mirror those of its foster parent.
While a group approach and the development of personal study projects can make learning easier and more productive, personal study with a little help from a teacher can go a long way.
Self-study with a small amount of help from a teacher is not a learning strategy but simply a way to help people learn a new skill, such as how to use a new computer program or a new tool.
Semi-supervised learning can take place either face-to-face or virtually, with the tutor playing the role of the teacher and the art teacher playing the role of the art teacher.
The instruction provided by a professional artist in some computer programs is designed to elicit questions, stimulate the student's creativity, and explain things that the student would otherwise find difficult to do on his own.
Children are placed in day-care centers for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up without the security, care, and education that many receive.
We feel that the Children's Center is the safest place for these children.
Our day-care centers should have safe homes, caring staff, regular education, and reliable health care.
Day-care centers should be equipped with the necessary things that were missing in the homes where the children were taken.
Social networking is a two-way street.
The Internet's versatility means that it can be used in a variety of ways and for a variety of purposes.
For example, "education" and "social networking" have been suggested as possible motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
A study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on social networking sites found that "Likeability" and "Friendliness" were the new top motivators.
The use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) has enabled scientists to unlock the secrets of facial recognition, allowing them to mimic human facial expressions in real time.
In this regard, it is said that one can tell when someone is lying by carefully interpreting his facial expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks showed how people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing because of brain damage can recognize speech simply by looking at someone's face.
He also suggested that animals, such as dogs, have the ability to interpret human behavior.
During the 20th century, research revealed that DNA can be divided into two basic types - cryptographic and digital.
Mutations lead to the production of new genetic variants, some of which become extinct because they are no longer useful.
In each successive generation, the two sets of genes divide and recombine, diverging and then replicating.
In the savanna, it is especially challenging for arthropods, whose digestive organs are similar to those of humans, to extract sufficient amino acids from the vegetation.
Moreover, a lack of proper nutrition has been linked to serious health problems, including obesity, malnutrition, and death.
The nutrients found in the leaves and seeds of rice plants are readily available, but they are difficult for organisms like us to digest - unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (such as insects, grains, and eggs) are more easily digested and are rich in nutrients and amino acids.
Considering all these factors, it should not be surprising that our ancestors had to cope with "the problem of malnutrition" much as the savannah rabbit does today.
Sleep deprivation is the practice of intentionally staying awake during sleep and then going back to sleep within a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done by setting an alarm clock that is not too loud so as not to disturb you.
If you regularly change the time of your alarm, set it far enough away from your bed so that you will be forced to get up and turn it off.
Another exercise involves drinking large quantities of fluids (especially water or tea, which are known to be very unstable) just before going to bed so that the body will be motivated to get up and move around during the night.
The degree to which a person enjoys inner peace depends on whether he is in touch with his flesh or his spirit.
When the body is relaxed, the outlook improves, and peace and contentment are the result.
All of us are susceptible to such judgment; the only limitation is our imperfect flesh and our sinful tendencies.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but it also incorporates Jain concepts of love and many of the refined exercises of Indian Yoga.
In fact, Tibetan Buddhism is much simpler, with Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and meditation on love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is activated by a series of physical exercises, breathing exercises, chanting exercises, and visualization exercises.
Tibetan meditation is characterized by the practice of Deity Yoga, in which the practitioner visualizes various gods and goddesses whose energies are unlocked, spiritual energies enter the body, and the practitioner realizes that he is enlightened.
After World War II, which was fought between the Allies and the Axis powers, the Soviet Union and the United States forged an alliance against the Axis powers, and by the end of the war, the breakdown of social, political, and cultural order had led to the breakup of that alliance.
Within two years of the war's end, hostilities between the Allies had escalated into the Cold War.
It was to be a 40-year-long struggle - a literal war between great powers, with real battles fought from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense system had collapsed, and the only solution was to retreat to the occupied part of Romania to rebuild.
However, those plans were soon thwarted when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded Belorussian and Ukrainian armies and occupied eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods from one part of the world to another.
Historically, the purpose of warships has been to ensure that your nation can continue to transport its people and supplies while at the same time preventing your enemies from doing the same.
Well-known recent examples include the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the United States sought to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in support of the British effort.
At the same time, the Germans tried to stop the flow of traffic by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have gained a decisive victory over Britain, with whom she shared a strategic alliance.
The domestication of goats probably began about 10,000 years ago in the Zegros Mountains of Iran.
In Bible times, people raised animals for their milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Herds of domestic goats were kept in herds in the mountains and on the plains, often led by young boys, similar to the way shepherds still lead their flocks.
During the 18th century, England developed its first tram system.
Although they were generally made by twisting two logs or sticks together to form a wagon, they allowed horses to pull a larger load more quickly and efficiently than paved roads.
However, it gradually became apparent that these methods could be more reliable than the use of wood or metal.
This became a common practice, but the metal wheels wore out more quickly than the harder wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron rails were put in operation.
The earliest form of human locomotion was walking, which evolved from four-legged to two-legged walking about two million years ago.
These early human ancestors did not have the ability to stand erect.
Bipedalism is attested in the remains of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus appears to have been bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.
We can learn to live in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental organizations, and we can act as change agents to reduce future problems.
However, to deal with the problem once and for all, we must address the underlying causes and eliminate them.
Admittedly, the world has changed greatly as a result of human advances in science and technology.
After the House approved the charter on June 4, a handwritten document signed by Speaker John Hancock and Clerk Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 Dunlap broadsides were printed.
The first public reading of the Declaration was given by John Nixon on July 8 on the lawn of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and it was read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are among the oldest known documents in existence, and no authentic handwritten copy has survived.
Most paleontologists believe that at least one genus of dinosaurs survived into modern times - birds.
Many people think that birds are not dinosaurs because they have scales and can fly.
However, there is strong evidence that birds are related to the dinosaurs.

Symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, appear in so many different areas of the body that it is unlikely that a simple case of food poisoning would warrant an immediate medical examination.
The most common symptom of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine.
Mark the label on the bottle to show what to do with the poison.
Entomologists use the word 'bug' to describe all kinds of insects.
The word is derived from the woodlouse, an ancient blood-sucking parasite.

The ultimate goal of science is to observe and understand the natural world by applying logic and reason - the scientific method.
But this is not the only method - experimentation, which is the act of trying to prove or disprove a hypothesis by asking questions and making observations, is also an important part of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers studied ancient texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in almost all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek culture declined, Western civilization lost confidence in Greek philosophy and science.
Biochemistry and molecular biology are based on the idea that natural processes occur and are regulated by time.
Weather patterns, which are not simply the result of circadian rhythms, have been well documented in many organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals.
The universe has a self-regulating clock that keeps perfect time even in the face of outside forces.
The mathematical work of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase was one of the first to suggest that the genetic code is a single strand of DNA.
Hershey and Chase used viruses that replicated inside other bacteria or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to measure the amount of DNA in phosphorylated viruses and the amount of protein in sulfur-containing viruses.
Mutations can produce a variety of effects, depending on the type of cell involved, the function of the altered region, and whether the altered gene is responsible for carrying genetic information.
Only mutations in genes can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations in any other type of cell can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is a form of tourism that appeals to nature lovers with the goal of enjoying nature's beauty, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of outdoor activities include building, fishing, photography, and visiting zoos and wildlife parks, as well as learning about the ecology of the area.
For example, explore, photograph, and learn about Borneo's wildlife.
Every morning, people in small towns drive to work and are often met by commuters who pass by their workplace.
In a traffic jam like this, everyone is close to each other and helpful, especially when it comes to public transportation.
Modern science confirms that an economy based on the use of fossil fuels has destroyed an ecosystem that has sustained human life for at least two billion years.
Everyone participates in community affairs and makes use of available transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed lands, there are no complaints about the quality of water or about leaky pipes.
Is it because of the failure of transportation experts, or is something more serious at work?
Traffic is a field of study that focuses on how drivers and vehicles get from one place to another and how they interact on the road.
Unfortunately, learning to drive can be a challenge because of the changing attitudes of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to be more predictable; traffic patterns tend to be more predictable and easier to read.
To calculate the flow of traffic, you can consider three factors: (1) the flow of traffic, (2) the density of traffic, and (3) the speed of traffic.
All three factors are involved in the planning of traffic signals.
Their ability to fly enabled them to avoid predators and to find food and mates quickly.
Many butterflies and moths have the ability to fold their wings in response to touch.
This gives them plenty of room to hide from predators.
For now, the insects that cannot fold their wings are classified as insects of the order Lepidoptera.
Two thousand years earlier, Greek philosopher Aristarchus had suggested that the planets revolve around the sun.
Some were convinced that he was right, but many others still held that the sun and the stars rotate around the earth.
Does this sound reasonable to many, since the earth appears to be stationary?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest river and carries eight times as much water as the second-largest river on earth.
In addition, the Amazon basin is the widest river basin in the world, measuring some four miles [6 km] in width.

Gold, silver, and copper have long been known to mankind because they occur in nature and are readily available from mines equipped with advanced equipment.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more elements - carbon, water, air, and fire.
This included the four classical elements (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although Aristotle also explained that these elements change from one form to another to form physical matter.
Remember, there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium can be purified as metals.
Other scales are composed of elements other than iron, such as carbon.
Every living thing is made up of matter, and matter is made up of tiny bubbles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence could not contain them.
Thus, the pencil became a household item almost as soon as it was invented.
Sadly, the pencil has been rendered obsolete by modern technology.
Nowadays, electronic text messaging has replaced the pencil sharpener.
One might wonder, then, what the future holds for computerized typesetting.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle that hundreds of atoms must combine to form a nucleus with thousands of protons and millions of neurons.
Nuclear fission releases most of the energy stored in nuclear reactions.
Some atoms have moving nuclei, which means that they explode when they are subjected to very little or no pressure.
The moon's crust is a thin layer of rock and dust called the lunar mantle.
The earth's crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick at the poles and 60 miles [100 km] at the equator.
On the dark side of the moon, called the maria, the crust is thin, while on the higher regions, the crust is thick.
Because of the thinness of the earth's crust, much of the outer layer is dark and exposed to the sun.
Content theories focus on what motivates people to be enthusiastic or to believe.
According to content theories, it is suggested that people have innate desires for certain things throughout their lives.
Content theories attempt to explain why some people desire the things they do and the things in their environment that prevent them from doing or not doing certain things.
Two examples of content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Basically, there are two types of attitudes that leaders in the workplace display when they begin to dominate their peers.
This type of leader is unable to do the following: come up with a solution that is not to everyone's liking, explain away mistakes, explain procedures, delegate responsibilities, and get everyone on board.
On the other hand, a leader adopts a new personality and wants to change everything that has happened and start a new cycle.
It must be acknowledged that the employer is often responsible for the failure or success of the workplace.
This attitude often leads to conflict between management and the workplace in general.
Social networking can be just as effective as face-to-face meetings, with a few key differences.
Online chat rooms and phone groups often serve as a means of instantaneous physical contact.
Often, they are more effective on their own than are members of a team who stay together because their teams meet at different times that are difficult for their managers to grasp.
The presence of a veritable "invisible crowd" (Larson and Lafasto, 1989, p109) is a notable feature of online communities.
An "invisible group" is a group of people who coordinate activities and receive reports from one another.
Why would an organization want to embark on a project that consumes so much time and effort to promote the organization's interests when one of the goals of such a project is to effect positive change?
When all the resources of an organization are put to good use by all its members, good organization results.
Thus, a cooperative approach to handling disasters can help us to adjust our operations to meet the needs of the communities we serve.
Before an organization can begin to change its culture, leaders must establish a culture that promotes the sharing of knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes a Continuum approach that is used to help organizations become more efficient.
The neuroscience literature provides evidence for the use of cognitive-behavioral techniques. This, in turn, limits the scope of analysis to one or a few topics.
The link between mental illness and behavior has intrigued researchers.
It is well-known that brain injuries, trauma, and tumors can affect behavior and thinking.
State-of-the-art technology allows us to see and study regions and processes of the brain as never before.
This gives us a good idea of how our mind works.
Although AI is still in its infancy in the realm of science fiction and fantasy, it is vital to the field of computer science because of its potential for behavior analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Al's research enables machines to operate autonomously.
These include the ability to observe movement, to formulate a plan of action, to answer questions, and to recognize speech sounds and facial expressions.
These have now become part of the curriculum and are helping to solve real-life problems.
AI is now being used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military, and it is featured in many computer games.
In many cases, the instructor may be able to take the students to places that are not easily accessible by bus.
Modern technology enables students to observe natural phenomena without having to leave the classroom.
Collaborative inquiry without leaving the classroom is a way to reflect on the journey to the site and a way to share what you have learned with future students.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina post about their trip to the State Capitol and annually update their posts without deleting their old ones.
Writing and posting information online can also help students improve their writing skills. While student writing is initially plagued with errors, such as spelling mistakes, the mere presence of readers can help students improve their writing.
Since students are often the first to read what is posted on the Internet, the typist may have to practice spelling words correctly to avoid interruptions.
In an effort to meet readers' expectations, students strive to be witty and entertaining (Toto, 2004).
E-mail allows students to interact with one another and to learn without having to be in a classroom.
Effective use of social networking sites "can empower students to develop critical thinking skills; through authoritative commentary, students can express their views on a variety of topics that others have written about and openly express their own opinions on the issues at hand (Oravec, 2002).
