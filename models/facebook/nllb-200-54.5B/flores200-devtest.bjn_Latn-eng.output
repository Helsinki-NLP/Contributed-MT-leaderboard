This was not only to confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, the theory went, but the details of the fossils suggested otherwise, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say the animal's fur is either pale chestnut brown above or carotenoid below.
His discoveries also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a perfectly elevated central ridge, called a rachis, but were characteristic of other feathers - spines and barbels - researchers concluded that the rachis must have evolved from these other features.
The arrangement of the feathers suggests that they were not for flight but for temperature regulation or appearance.
Researchers think that although these are the tails of juvenile dinosaurs, the samples show adult feathers and no underfur.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effects that the team is looking for could be caused by tidal interactions between galaxy cluster material and Milky Way cluster material.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Researchers can conclude that solid materials affect other solid materials in the same way.
This theory states that most of the condensed matter around galaxies is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, and is made up of tiny particles.

After the clerk verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to witness the election process. In the afternoon, the votes are counted by volunteers under direct supervision following a specific procedure.

Last month a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the former CEP as part of the country's move towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, which were supposed to be held in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional heat-related incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the suspension of Apple's report "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm Friday GMT)
The Northern Mariana Islands emergency management office said that no damage was reported domestically.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer kidnaps Hong Kong tourists and hijacks their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and parents, were released early, along with some Filipino guards.
The riders then replaced an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrics specialist and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
During his time at the hospital Liggins began to investigate premature births at random times.
His research showed that the hormone was regulated in order to accelerate fetal lung development.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight recordings on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "She was the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. She died two months ago. She was so unique. She was so strong".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna is as beautiful as I am...I think even more so...love her and cherish her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a Republic were up 8 percent from 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed expressed a desire for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic immediately, while 31 percent believed Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist swam the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle in three rounds at the Commonwealth Games, but her second-round fitness was in doubt.
She was no longer able to take her pain medication and they withdrew her from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and Professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, had discovered the largest prime number on January 25.
Several fact-checking missions using different hardware and software began in February and were reported on Tuesday.
Comets are thought to be the source of Earth's water supply along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, in particular how the Earth formed, since comets have impacted the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
It was based on messages about "Political discourse and humor".
He ran for President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly at low altitudes while saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ground-based radar technology to provide air traffic control and aircraft guidance with better visibility and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transport available and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and off-street parking facilities are not available in the area.
Concern over lack of transportation increased the likelihood that reserve matches would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new varieties develop in only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the Darwin's parrot outbreak, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus fins, Geospiza kunirustris.
Gold can be worked into many shapes; it can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can also be stamped or rolled into sheets.
They could be made very thin, and were so closely related to one another that they were sometimes used to create hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
White cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (hence hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
The second stirring of the dry powder is then, with clean, wet hands, kneaded into a ball.
Moisture in the hands of the shell reacts with the outer layer, where it tastes funny and forms shells.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, linked to sophisticated sewage systems.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in settlements in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were sold in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then transmit it down, rapidly.
Satellites are sent into space using rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere alters our light and illumination.
It uses giant rockets over 100 feet tall to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us more convenience and faster transportation.
The wheel has brought us buggies, motorcycles, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to rabbits and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging captive cats) that eat a much wider variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success was the concept of the curve, a special function that cats have over their competitors.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three dependent adult males, and up to thirty females and their young.
The industrious were close to each other, becoming a large family of brothers and daughters.
Packs of lions act like packs of wolves or hyenas, are sexually similar to lions (but not cats), and are extremely lethal to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit awkwardly), hop, leap long distances and throw with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are in the same group (Gen Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not entirely like that of a lion, but more like a snarling, screeching phrase.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals. It will catch lizards, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, smelling where they are on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision, and move silently, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in the environment and then attacking the prey.
When small groups of organisms (in small populations) become separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move to a mountainous or riverine region, or if they move to a new island where it is difficult for them to return) they often find themselves in a different place from where they were before.
These new environments had different resources and different competitors, so the new populations either needed different traits or adapted to be more competitive than they had been previously.
The initial population has not changed at all, it still requires the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new populations began to adapt to their new environments, they became less wary and less tolerant of other populations.
In fact, thousands or millions of years ago, two populations of a reservoir would have looked so different that they could not have been the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of their time, so they feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long bushy jaw and more than 70 sharp, needle-like teeth, accompanied by an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meant that there was no escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but they probably had forked tongues. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have even been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a large dinosaur like T. rex would have been no match for them.
Although much of their food may seem similar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual dishes, including wild boar, birds of prey, snakes, and a type of rodent called the durmus.
Another difference was that while the poor women and men ate their meals sitting on couches, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they sat on couches while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods imported from Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the twentieth century.
For example, they did not eat corn, or tomatoes, or beans, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple that was believed to be the home of that god.
The people brought offerings to the gods and the priests attended to the gods' needs by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Later special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine to the deity.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, housing was unimportant.
Much of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops opened directly to the street.
For there is no wood in the land, and the price of wood is high.
Greenland is sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when the mainland drifted far to the west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever the discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is a 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, monarchs, dress, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
He said, "That's not true. Let someone write on the back of the document, this is not a treasure tape".
Inscribed on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776".
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that when this miracle occurred, the large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Thus, it is like a note added only to a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by "Vichy" France, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and then collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and turned to face Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by large groups of people living and working together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to Latin civis, meaning population, and vicus, meaning city or town-state, and also serves as a way of defining the size of a society.
City-states were the predecessors of states. The culture of a civilization means the transmission of knowledge through many generations, an ongoing cultural process with a smooth spread.
Small cultures often became extinct without leaving any relevant historical evidence and failed to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government - with the Assemblies they were a part of - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Council had little power to levy taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on the state authorities, who were often unhelpful, to enforce all its laws.
It also lacks the authority to reject tax and tariff regulations between countries.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended and states assumed the core of a central government whose representatives would abstain.
The Italy national football team is, together with Germany, the second most successful national football team in the world and was the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Approved sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, soccer, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan includes nearly 7,000 islands (mostly Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan occupies, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or Forbidden Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating changes in aboriginal wheat-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western part of Taiwan and the northern part near the coast and recognized Taiwan as a Province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which granted Taiwanese sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they really look like.
By 1976, thirty pyramids of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common photographic image format is still 35 mm, which was the size of film at the end of the analog film era.
These are still made today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been reduced to that of a digital camera's image sensor.
The 35mm format was actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this form (divided in half for convenience to get the ratio of whole numbers) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common forms (e.g. forms of the APS family) equally or more closely approximate these aspect ratios.
The three widely abused and often followed rules of thumb are that directions easily create dynamism while maintaining the measurement sequence of an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, gained prominence.
For more than a thousand years Christianity had bound European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church existed for that reason.
The central authority of the church had existed in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether the principle had been fulfilled.
Following the outbreak of hostilities, the British began to blockade German sea lanes.
The plan was recognized as effective, containing important military and population provisions, although the blockade violated a series of international rules agreed upon in several international treaties in the last two centuries.
The British installed international waters mines to deter any ships entering all parts of the ocean, causing danger to even neutral shipping.
While there was limited retaliation for this plan, Germany expected similar retaliation to ships during its unrestricted war.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most societies and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with his ideas, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the difference in time; each era in China or each dynasty was a different dynasty.
Also between each of these dynasties were periods of unstable provincial division, most notably the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these times fierce battles were fought between rival nobles for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in Chinese history as thousands of people died in the struggle for the imperial throne in Xi'an.
There were many social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the move from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And also later the Open Enrollment Act for all men allowed the most ambitious and successful to continue.
As in the military, army ranks were now based on ability, not class.
The French Revolution also enabled many of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was fascinated by the supernatural. He often went to the cave later named 'Hira' on Mount "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
He is self-sufficient, enduring for days, which gives a clear picture of His spiritual will.
Resting on one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find them once you know they're there. Once you're in there, the foundation of truth is lost.
Nothing can be seen except a clear sky surrounded by many mountains. Very little can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The characteristic "up bow" looks like the letter V and the characteristic "down bow mark" looks like a gaping wire or box with no bottom.
Upper means you should start at the tip and point downward, and lower means you should start at the frog (your hand covering the upper) and point downward.
The upper-lower frequencies produce smaller sounds, while the lower-lower frequencies are stronger and louder.
It is up to you to create your own characteristics, but remember that most characteristics are there for musical purposes, so they should always be taken into account.
The infuriated King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 forced a group of market women to return to Paris from Versailles.
On the train, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob who jeered and threatened the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their mouths wide.
It was then that a mob paraded the dead head of the royal guard at Versailles before the fearsome Queen.
United States imperialism's war expenditures in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial rulers of the United States mostly to pay for the issuance and interest of floating bonds bearing the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
That is, taking advantage of the continued oppression of the Filipinos was a fundamental advantage of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars is to understand the events behind the formation of the order.
The High Middle Ages was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages began with the Early Middle Ages and merged into the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the virtue of technology or technological necessity to the strict notion that human destiny is controlled by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a pace that exists largely outside of cultural or political influence.
For example, one could argue that automobiles would lead to more roads.
However, this national road network was not economically viable for even a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also led to a higher incidence of road accidents, which led to the discovery of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong cultural element of determinism, influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanticism, geography formed a substrate, and over time Western customs and cultures associated with geography emerged, and these, in turn, became adapted to the social context, rather than enforced by law.
While Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices worth more than what the Byzantine Markets would have offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication, Western fashion trends can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, regions of western Europe began to develop their own styles.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted to produce just enough food for the farmer and his family.
Simplified agricultural life, more natural, systems using native seed stocks of the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers made their living from agriculture and this is still a problem in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop an identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several reasons.
Members of these subcultures typically signal their membership through differences and use styles to distinguish themselves, which include clothing styles, behaviors, and dialects.
One of the most commonly used ways to describe the importance of socialization is to justify some aspects of disadvantaged children as abandoned, unfortunate, or abused, deprived of parental care as they grow up.
Such children are called "feral" or feral. Some feral children have been confined and people (often their own parents) have treated them as abandoned children because their parents could not accept their deficiencies or physical disabilities.
These feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are thought to have been eaten by beasts; others are thought to have lived in the wild.
If the baseline is indeed possessed by a non-human animal, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) closely resembling that of the animal that possesses it.
While project-based learning makes learning more convenient and engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides assistance to people who are learning a new experience such as a new computer program or about to start a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in essence, the teacher forms Scaffolds but so does the paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Frameworks are embedded in software and are meant to query, instruct, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to do on their own.
Various reasons children are placed in foster care range from abandonment, abuse, and even child abuse.
No child should have to live in an uneducated, uncaring, and uneducated environment, but not with them.
We felt that the Orphanage System was a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system provides a safe home, a loving caregiver, a stable education, and adequate health care.
Nursing homes aim to provide all the necessities that they could not get at home before being placed here.
The Internet combines elements of interactive and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet create additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""sustained relationships"" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recorders led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that lasted milliseconds.
In particular, one can tell whether they are talking or not by their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, discusses how people who are unable to understand speech, due to brain disorders, are also able to judge sincerity partially.
He also added that the ability to interpret human behavior could be shared with animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Translocation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the visible population.
Separation and integration often resulted in recurring diversity between the two groups and within each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to satisfy their amino acid needs from available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
Available plant sources of protein are in leaves and nuts, but these are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked first.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, ants, termites) are not difficult to digest, but they also provide large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Significantly, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the wild today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking during normal sleep hours and then sleeping again later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done with a low-pitched alarm to alert us but not actually wake us up.
If we feel like turning off the alarm when we're sleepy, try turning it off on the other side when we're sleepy, this will make us less likely to wake up to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythm requires drinking plenty of fluids (water or tea, which stimulates urination) before getting up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in one's body and soul.
The lower the vibration, the more negative the life force is present. Each person has the possibility of finding complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can be enlightened. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stubbornness and selfishness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but is supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are simple: Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness.
And Kundalini Yoga Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga movements, training the senses, taste, sight.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga Deva. Through the contemplation of various deities energy channels are purified, inner energy is activated and enlightened awareness is formed.
Germany was an enemy of all nations in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
By the end of the two-year war, the former allies were now enemies again and the Cold War had begun.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was fought virtually, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and elsewhere.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences collapsed, and the Poles were in danger of surrendering and aligning with the Romanian headquarters.
However, the plan was considered to have failed overnight, when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Red Army entered and confronted Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods was the most convenient way to move large numbers of goods and people across oceans.
The navy's job is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move our goods and people, while, at the same time, blocking the enemy's ability to move their goods and people.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War.
At the same time, the German Navy, largely using U-boats, tried to block these shipping lanes.
If the Allies were unsuccessful, Germany thought it could subjugate Britain like any other European country.
Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began hunting them for their milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Local goats are usually kept in herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas, often led by goatherds who are mostly children or adolescents, similar to a shepherd known for his diligence.
Railways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Allowing wagons made only of planks to be connected, it allowed the horse-drawn carriages to reach top speeds and to pull heavier loads than on rough everyday roads.
Cross ties were first introduced to keep the rails from moving. Gradually, it was realized that rails could be made more efficient by placing iron rails on them.
This was a common experiment, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the carriage wear more easily.
Hence, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first time that we know of transport was on foot, two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning erect man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, were not as efficient walkers.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living green again, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering.
This is a symptomatic treatment in most cases. Therefore, if we do not want a permanent solution, we must find the root of the problem, and we must refuse to sell.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of humanity's advancement in knowledge and technology, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and excessive human lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent several blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
Altogether between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington's quarters on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist today are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to the present day.
Many people did not know they were dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But many of these birds still look like dinosaurs.
They had shallow, scaly legs, they stuttered, and they walked on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are essentially information processors encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and this number is simply considered a binary digit - or a string, to use computer language.
Toxicity in the body may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as nausea, are a sign that testing cannot be performed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
See the table above for first aid instructions that are as specific as possible for the type of poison.
The term pest is used by entomologists in a more formal sense to group these insects.
The term comes from the family of fleas and ticks, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin beetles and bed bugs are both nidicolous, adapted to live in nests or homes of their hosts.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
The couple may decide that raising the baby is not in their best interests, or the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to make adoption plans for their babies.
In adoption, the biological parent terminates their parental rights so that the other spouse can become the child's parent.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
But not only that, experimentation, and experiments are tests used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations and also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classics, especially the Bible in Latin.
The accepted one is Aristotle's view of all problems of knowledge, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production via the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps cycling freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments that marked the DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material affected and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations within stem-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include hunting, boating, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about ecosystems.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside by car to return to their workplaces and are passed by others who have just returned from work.
In this dynamic peer-to-peer vehicle each person is somehow connected to, and supports, their own car-based vehicle system.
Science now shows that this large carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of the stable conditions that had supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In the developing world you rarely hear the same level of concern about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system have such an advantage, why does the transportation system fail every day?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the relationships they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is very difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers of cars behave to a fairly similar extent; therefore, the flow of car traffic has strong similarities and can probably be represented mathematically.
To demonstrate good traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operations of highway facilities.
Sparrows were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gave them a wider range from small containers to bricks from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some think it is true but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never surpassed their size and technical excellence in construction.
The New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt was admired for its great monuments, which at the time were thousands of years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and one of the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Vulgar Italian was the everyday language of most of those who worked in the state while Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in native forms and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things were made from a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These are more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they evolved into new substances to form what we see.
A mixed metal is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can buy metals that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a collector's item for many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as newer forms of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to secondary status and use.
People now type messages on a computer screen, without having to click on a link.
One can only imagine what the keyboard would be like if something new came along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is needed to fuse together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like pulling a wagon up a hill. Splitting the nucleus back and releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei meaning that they quickly break apart with little or no propulsion.
The lunar surface is composed of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and firmer under the plateau.
There may have been many maria on the near side as the crust thinned.
Content theory focuses on discovering what makes people tick or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wants that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what causes certain people to do the things they do and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two of the most prominent contents of the theory are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when a manager begins to lead his or her subordinates: One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or the girl).
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable addict who feels compelled to change everything he has ever done and make it his own.
However, leaders are ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often creates tension between the leader and other group members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but slightly different.
Virtual group members often serve as focal points for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional group members as their groups may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible fold" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of the virtual fold of sales.
An "invisible group" is a management group to which each member reports. The invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are effectively used across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can spread.
As a result, organizational processes divide work to overcome obstacles in order to accommodate new inefficient processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share the organization's knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognition research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allowed us to see and probe structures and processes of the brain that had never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong scientific connotations, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and adaptive behavior in machines.
Research in AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer inquiries, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become disciplines in their own right, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. It is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take his or her students on a bus to a destination of their choice.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing travel experiences virtually is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with classmates in real time.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is updated, but the old version remains available as a scrapbook.
Selling blogs can help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with a messy grammar and syntax, the presence of a tutor generally changes that.
Because students were the most critical audience, bloggers began to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to feed the curiosity of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can liberate students by making them more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can establish their position in the context of other writings and even articulate their own views on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant and bilingual capital city and features various art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All this and more highlighted Ontario as what was considered most representative of Canada by outsiders.
The vast area to the far north is sparsely populated and some nearby deserts are uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprised many: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arab traders brought Islam to these lands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female tourists say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Reserves help sales when rings are worn (but not when they look expensive).
Women should be aware that different cultures may mean what they perceive as flirting and are often followed, hands shaken, etc.
Be polite when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (culturally different or not, that doesn't make everything okay).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the fort as Daru I-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the most popular shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hukkas, and various trinkets, but these are mostly for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flowing from Mount Nyiragongo that buried most of its streets, especially in the downtown area.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any disturbances outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a centre for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along the cheapest mountain gorilla trail in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (jeep) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a low-cost trip.
Associated with its difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist destination, and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main filming locations during the PBS special Henry Louis Gates' Wonder of the World Africa.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the borders of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-regions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and it is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee to enter the park.
This may be a bargain for someone buying a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is considered a major tourist destination.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are aligned like a rainbow diagram shown by the waterfront of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took possession and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) into Bangladesh and India inland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forests are not mangrove swamps - they are among the few remaining remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by wetlands.
By 1966 the Sundarbans had become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 leopard deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-regional buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Cattle taxis are a quick and convenient means of getting to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, are 378 meters long and have two columns 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011, but did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to officially open in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is nearing completion.
The Guaraní were an indigenous group who lived in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living semi-nomadic lives as hunter-gatherers who also farmed the surrounding farmlands.
The Chaco region is also home to other indigenous groups including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who make their living from hunting, small-scale farming and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, originally called the "Province of the Indian Giants", was born as a result of the contact between Spanish conquistadors and a group of indigenous tribes.
The Spanish also led the colonial period for three centuries.
Ever since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguayans have been able to maintain their originality and identity.
Argentina as we know it also has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
A major tournament is held annually in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Smaller races and competitions may be held here at other times of the year.
For information on the competition and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
The money could be exchanged at the island's only bank which was located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds were readily accepted everywhere around the island and credit cards in Stanley and US dollars could still be used occasionally.
On some remote islands various credit cards are not accepted, although British and United States currency may be carried; check with the owner first to determine which payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, as currency is exchanged before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it has summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months it regularly exceeds +30 °C.
Winters are bitterly cold: temperatures can sometimes fall below freezing, but wind and humidity tend to combine to create a cold sensation on the thermometer.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is more or less uniform throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals remain wild, and cannot be fed or handled.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from cougars and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Regardless of how they were built, forts, deer, elk, moose, and even other animals could attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance.
In addition, be aware of the attractive odors of rodents and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was made the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval battle in 1889 when seven warships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk, and about 200 American and German sailors died.
During the struggle for independence waged by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town led to the death of the Tupua Tamasese paramount leader Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, and Auckland is situated between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all beaches are sandy and sheltered bays, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the Waitematā Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
It is a sometimes crowded family beach with many shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is a complex, yet mellow and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be cheaper.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, the term "milk coffee" is commonplace. This is a small black 'espresso', the cappuccino is topped with a generous amount of cream (not foam), and the tea is brewed without milk.
The hot chocolate was adapted to Belgian standards.
Many trips to the reef are made all the time, and the injury caused by the reef is fatal.
If you do, listen to the authorities, obey all signs and heed all safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near the coast and around estuaries from October to April from the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the sea, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a safe place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Ticket sellers often have agreements with specific hotels, if you can find them to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through travelers.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, accommodation en route to/from the airport or even combine airline and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about your application or purchase other documents for your purposes (such as a visa).
Any changes or cancellation requests must be made with the ticket seller in advance and cannot be made directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most participants who attend the music festival decide to camp at the location, and most participants also consider it an important experience.
If you want to be close to the performance, you should arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even after the music has finished on the main stage, there may be parts of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location first, as crossing the ice causes enough noise to frighten even the most hardened of them.
When Saint Petersburg cruise ships enter the city, cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check requirements).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guests happy, and to keep them in their seats.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all skilled gamblers should know the importance of staying alert.
Anyone intending to drive at altitude or over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or extremely cold or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as you can on asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can trap you and cause you to fall accidentally.
Visibility can also be impaired by snowfall or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's bonnet.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted year-round.
The safari is probably the major tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in common usage refers to an overland journey to view the extraordinary wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, stay close to the ground with standard equipment to provide good vision.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards remember their prey and you will see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also called "grass walking", "climbing", or "hiking") consists of climbing, either for hours or days.
The Paralympic Winter Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with several winter games being held at different venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games, having done so in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by late March the most common cancellation policy was based on March 2020, when the Olympics were rescheduled.
It is estimated that most reserve event tickets cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothing can help dry you out. Many hotels have ironing boards and irons are available for loan, and some may not be available in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not wish to wear socks on your feet, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorch).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas a minute's worth of water is sufficient, in others a few more minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter unknown animal pests in their area of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or cause itching, burning, and infection.
Infectious diseases, dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, etc. are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to exchange goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in some places.
Long-distance travelers heading to other heavily taxed countries could sometimes earn large sums of money, if only by trading alcoholic beverages for tobacco.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, while frequently traversing forested islands along the way.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is wise to take advantage of the narrow, winding, and twisting roads.
Speed limits are obviously lowest at the front and rear ends) - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)) - and it is certainly important to obey the rules.
Also, strangely enough, cell phone service is slower here than on straight roads on other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
Storms in Germany are relatively mild, and in Bavaria, they are numerous and varied, similar to those of their neighbour, southern Austria.
Fruit-based dishes are common with apples cooked into a round pastry, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many baked goods in Germany also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, among others.
If you want a variety of smaller dishes, these are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a food whose basic ingredients are spices, with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of gravy.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found widely throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term karancakan means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a variety of dishes rich in spices, the predominant spices preferred by Javanese are nuts, lumbuk, sugar (especially Javanese jaggery) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups support the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but the sale of the ladder is of concern and safety because of the potential for a rider's legs to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but the leg is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse breaks free. To minimize this risk, a number of safeguards are used.
Initially, most riders wore small boots that fitted the heel, were fairly narrow, and had soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly British saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup skin to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous walls and large granite outcrops.
The summit of the mountain includes spectacular views from above. Climbers from different parts of the world often make new routes across one of the potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snowsports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiers or snowboarders sliding down a slope bounded by snow.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, often called "ski bums", planning extended vacations to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing declined again until at least the 17th century, when in 1861 the first recreational ski clubs were opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not involve the styles of alpine ski touring or mountaineering, with the latter being done on steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover longer distances on foot - but only occasionally will you gain the speed of a backpacking cross-country skier on a groomed track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, travel through some countries requires passing through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen Area, however, works much like a country in this respect.
Once you are in the region, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that can be applied to manufactured items as antiques.
These definitions vary geographically, where age limits may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be designated as antiques, although they are not the same as mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding became the main occupation of the Sámi people and the culture surrounding the trade was also important for other activities.
Although traditionally, not all Sami worked large-scale reindeer farms, they lived by hunting, trapping and the like, with reindeer mostly used as pack animals.
Today the Sami are engaged in modern trade.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanies, the word "Gypsy" is often stigmatized due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted view of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of a travel report, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, Americans in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans and Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and overly familiar compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause destruction, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and deforestation are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk bad weather poses to their region as the weather can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone must receive expert training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile Environments Course' will likely yield the address of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically last for 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Seafarers with regular sex reassignment surgery assignments abroad must ensure they carry the correct documentation for the return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports with an undeclared gender (X) or modify the document to conform to the desired name and gender variety.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varied greatly.
Checks at security checkpoints also became particularly troublesome in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
People who have undergone transgender surgery cannot expect to pass through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are currents that flow backwards from waves breaking on a beach, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology the countercurrents are concentrated in some of the deeper parts, and fast currents into the water may form there.
Most deaths were caused by the shock wave trying to swim back upstream, which seemed impossible.
Once you are out of the current, turning back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to steer to a place where you can't be caught or, depending on your skill and where you can be seen, wait for help.
Returning customs are much more elaborate than those that came before (less the honeymoon phase), longer, more elaborate.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have difficulty assimilating into their own.
By the time you return from abroad, you have usually learned a new culture and lost some of your own.
When first living abroad, it is usually understood that travelers entering a new country will need to adapt.
The crowd was unprepared for the patience and understanding it would take for the tourists to return home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most popular attractions here for children.
You can see the pyramid at night and you can see it in silence before the tour starts.
Often you can hear the voices of tourists and traders.
The Sphinx served as a backdrop and a long-distance traveller.
His ashes are displayed in his pyramid and in other pyramids of the plain.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are recognised by several countries and have the most bases, with six active as of 2020.
