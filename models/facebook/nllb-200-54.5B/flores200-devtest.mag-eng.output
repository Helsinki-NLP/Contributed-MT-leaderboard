This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already abundant, but provides an explanation why fossils typically cannot display color and three-dimensional arrangements.
The wings of these animals were chestnut-brown above and pearly or carotenoid below, the scientists said.
This discovery sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Finding that dinosaur wings did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of the wing - barbs and barbules - researchers speculated that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development of this other feature.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used for temperature regulation or display rather than in flight. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and not the underside of a chick.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effects that the team was looking for would be due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, creating tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Milky Way galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is located in a type of halo around a galaxy, and is composed of many smaller particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (AgSDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "much more troublesome and dangerous because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Mol thinks some patients may have contracted the bug in hospitals, and at least two were hospital health workers.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 close people in a year.
However, the percentage of aXDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any particular moment in South Africa.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain fairly constant temperatures, but it is consistent with having a hole deep in the ground", said Glenn Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team, of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, insert a pre-printed sheet of paper depicting the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
After the authorities verify the identity of the voter, the voter leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes have been added except for those duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance, following specific procedures.

This is commonplace elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts have looked at the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, noted that "journalists walk a dangerous line when publishing photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made until at least the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will mention the border dispute, which the Palestinians want based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were monitored by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive security and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission had recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests have been launched over the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunction have been reported, with a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating events to it, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake in Mariana struck at 7:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management said no damage had been reported in the country.
As well the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A retired Filipino policeman hijacks a tourist bus from Hong Kong in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least 6 more people have been confirmed dead so far.
A total of 6 people including children and elderly were released soon, including the photographer.
Photographers later substituted an old woman for him when he went to the bathroom, and Mendoza was killed.
Liggins pursued a career in medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor pains in her spare time.
Her research shows that if a hormone is administered it will speed the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of AquaStream. I was the first manager. Luna died two moons ago.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as we were...maybe more so...loved her and will miss her...hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those surveyed, who wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the poll's peak, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist had swum the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts have been cast on her fitness due to her complaints.
He has been unable to take the medications needed to relieve his pain as he has been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and an announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of organic materials as well as water delivery to Earth that could have formed proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to point aircraft with greater accuracy and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is being deployed and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the ground.
Fears of transport shortages increased the likelihood that the team would win without supporters forced to play the game behind closed doors.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process takes longer due to breeding between a native Darwin finch, Geospia fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospia conirostris.
Gold could be worked in all kinds of shapes. Agoras could be modeled in small sizes.
The agora could be drawn in thin wire, which could be twisted and plated. The agora could be inscribed or rolled into sheets.
Agoras could be made very thin, and glued onto other metals. Agoras could be made so thin that agoras were sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
Agora called a chemical pH. They could make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical gives an indication of the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons stripped from them (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Twist two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in the exposed hand will react with the outer layers, which will look strange and form a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then reflect it back to Agora almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light we see.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet high is required to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing about the wheel for us is that it provides us with very easy and fast transportation.
It has brought me trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a specialized job that each cat holds that prevents the agoras from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride is made up of three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other due to having a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function much like packs of wolves or dogs, the animals behave surprisingly similarly to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only four of these cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a series of hoarse, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that prey on ocelots are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt for food by following the scent of prey that they find on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than before.
The native populations have not changed at all, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were the top predators of their time as they feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Aegir's long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor sharp teeth, with an additional set at the top of his mouth meaning that nothing could pass through them.
We can't say for sure, but the Agora test may have been bizarre. The Agora feeds on turtles, large fish, and other shrimp, and may be cannibalistic.
There is also evidence that it would have attacked if it came underwater, to the extent that a giant dinosaur could not have survived there.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had strange or unusual feast items including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse as part of their diet.
Another difference was that where the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich people preferred to dine together, where they sat on their sides while they sat together.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered the home of the gods.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped minarets, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temple.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Much of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; stores had open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, and timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas they say he was banished from Iceland for murdering Erik the Red, and while travelling further west, found Greenland and renamed it Greenland.
But regardless of that discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already inhabiting Ozja at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote the Agora, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (the Agora measures 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) were rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
These "Vichy" were ruled by the French. It was the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them rather than fight the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civicus, meaning citizen, related to the Latin citius, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also somehow defines the shape of the S.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge across many generations, a lingering cultural footprint and impartial diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state officials to enforce its acts of congress, which were often uncooperative.
The augur had no power to override tax laws and duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimity of all the states before they could be amended and the states brought the central government into such disrepute that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often called, for geographical purposes, the Archipelago due to its being a group of clusters/islands.
Taiwan's beginnings began in the 15th century where European sailors crossed the strait naming it Ilha Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwest Taiwan, and began to change the ancient methods of grain production and employ Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a state of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, known as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
To give tourists a better sense of what they initially looked like, most of the buildings at the far end of the complex were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration is still underway.
For example, the most prevalent still photography in the world is 35 mm which was the most effective film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Acorns are still produced today, but the acorn length-to-height ratio is derived from the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
This format has a width-to-height ratio (divided by 12 to get the common integer ratio) of 3:2, hence the name.
Very common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are very close to or equal to this aspect ratio.
The much admired and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a guideline for arranging order in photographs with passion.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection point of the line dividing the photo into horizontal and vertical thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, rose to prominence.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity had bound the kingdoms of Europe together for more than a thousand years.
Aegir's omnipotence affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A core Christian principle is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church monetary funds are specifically for this.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This tactic proved effective, cutting off significant troop and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international norms, codified under various international agreements over the previous two centuries.
Britain built tunnels in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area of the sea, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this strategy was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and the country were pacifism and isolationism.
Seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He approached Thomas Edison in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job).
Ancient China had unique ways of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or dynasties that held power was a distinct dynasty.
There were temporary eras of kingdoms divided between each dynasty. The most famous of the time between the Han and Jin dynasties were the Three Dynasties that ruled for 60 years.
This period saw fierce battles between various kings for the throne.
The Three Dynasties period was the bloodiest era in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people killed in a battle for the largest throne in the magnificent palace at Xi'an.
It has had many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that the state belongs to the people and not to a king.
Even after the revolution, the job was open to all male applicants, with only the most ambitious and fortunate succeeding.
The same system applied in the military as class-based Army ranks now became merit-based.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which had long since ceased to exist, provides a very vivid illustration of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave, located on the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, finding the agora is not easy even if one knows that it exists. Once inside the cave, it is complete solitude.
Nothing could be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world could be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (of which The Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wife and family members.
The upward arc symbol looks like a V and the "downward arc" symbol looks like a staple or square with the bottom missing.
Top means you should push the bow starting from the tip, and bottom means you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow).
Up-arcs usually produce softer sounds, while down-arcs are stronger and more pronounced.
Feel free to mark in your own numbers, but remember that printed Boeing numbers are for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
Riding in a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The expenses of American imperialism's war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large part of the expenses of American colonial rule and interest on bonds issued through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic benefits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the Order.
The period in which events took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300) is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which according to tradition ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in itself encompasses a very large range of ideas. Technology-push or technological necessity simply means that we human beings are driven by a logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
In technical terms, most interpretations revolve around two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path other than cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "influences" on society from within, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the development of roads is due to the motor car.
However, the road network spread across an entire country is not sufficient for cars, so work is underway on measures to make cars cost-effective through new modes of production.
Having too many cars also increases the risk of accidents requiring new technologies in health care to fix broken bodies.
A major component of libertarianism was cultural determinism, derived from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of libertarianism, geography shapes people, and over time those geography shapes the emergence of customs and culture, and these, by virtue of being appropriate to the society's location, are superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Acre's reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century the situation in Acre deteriorated, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the genre lagged 25 to 30 years behind in the West.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest events of that time was that as a result of the Crusades people started to use buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system, that uses seeds saved in that ecosystem in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender specific.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all of these elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through specific and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or feral. Some feral children have been captured by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children display almost entirely caring animal-like behaviors (within physiological limits), such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that assists people who are gaining experience learning something new such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds have been put into the software and it questions, hints and explains processes that can be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for all these children.
Our foster care system is perceived as providing safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which it was first taken.
The Internet serves as a link between both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
Additional dimensions are graining the Internet in terms of specific properties, usage, and satisfaction.
For example, the use of the Internet for "education" and "socialization" has been shown to be important motivators (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""continuous connection"" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Egham and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting up to a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting subtle expressions one can determine whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper The Presidential Speech that people unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to correctly assess sincerity.
He has also said that a similar ability to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as the domestic dog.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection now removes it from the pool of manifest variation.
Isolation and recombination alters the variation between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems like humans have difficulty meeting their amino-acid requirements from the plant resources available to all.
And as such, failure to do so has serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and seeds, but primates like us find it difficult to digest these unless they are cooked.
Unlike agar, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they provide high amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of waking you up well within the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a quiet alarm clock to bring oneself to consciousness without waking oneself completely.
If you could reset the clock in your sleep, you could put it on the other side of the room, which you could comfortably get out of bed to turn off.
All other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing people to urinate.
The amount of peacefulness within a man is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality. All humans have the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extends the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. Agora Kundalini includes yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) along with Kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is yoga. Through the visions of various deities the energy nadis are cleansed, chakras are activated and knowledge consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, systems, procedures, and culture clashed, causing the country to withdraw.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It's going to last for the next 40 years and will be fought virtually, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and beyond.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their countries maintain the ability to move their people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German Navy was attempting to interdict this traffic, mainly by using U-boats.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to win over Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, especially similar to the more commonly known herders, who were children or adolescents. This method of animal husbandry is still used today.
Wagonways were built in the 16th century in England.
But because wagonways had parallel planks of bare wood, they helped horses run faster and pull more weight than the more rugged roads of the day.
Crossties to hold the tracks in place had been introduced much earlier. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top of them.
These have become commonplace, but more wear on the wooden wheels of iron wagons.
Later, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail was introduced.
The first known transport is walking, humans began walking upright with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago.
Before that, Australopithecus did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Saelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can all start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, we don't just want a temporary solution, we want to find the root of the problem, and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world is changing greatly due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and many problems have arisen due to overpopulation and mankind living differently.
After the Agora was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as the "Dunlop broadsides".
The first public reading of the document is performed by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read the Agora to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy of the Agora arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides still extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original handwritten copies survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs today.
They have legs with scales and claws, can lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - as computer jargon uses.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used colloquially by entomologists to refer to insects.
The term refers to any species similar to bats that can survive on humans.
Both blood-sucking insects and bats kill parasites that have lived in someone else's nest.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which now leaves it as the dominant neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the interests of their children to have children.
The couple may choose to plan an adoption for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parent terminates their parental rights so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Although it is not the only, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West cut itself off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observations in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue periods of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments labeling proteins of either phase with DNA in the tau phase or with radioactive sulfur in the phosphorus phase.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether or not the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting the park and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is learning about, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by other people, whose work destination is the place they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transportation shuttle is connected in some way, and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy removed the biosphere from one of its steady states that had supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost all people complain about transportation systems.
In the developed world you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Transportation systems generate complaints on a daily basis that they are failing, that transportation engineers are simply incompetent, or that something more fundamental is going on.
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with one another.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, traffic flow has some reasonable stability and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability in flight helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't look like it's spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country and the most sparsely populated country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in native form and were much easier to make with primitive machines.
Aristotle, a philosopher, postulated that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same line): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also dictated that we evolve into new things that we are.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been taken to less status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to come close to the sharpener.
One can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
Fusion bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy car up a hill. Re-splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they decay with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick near and 100 km thick far.
It thins out below the maria and thickens below the highlands.
There may have been more maria nearby as the crust thinned.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts or appeals to people.
This theory suggests that people all have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature to adulthood.
This theory looks at what it is about some people that makes them want what they do and what it is in their environment that motivates them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a stranger transforms into a man, who realizes that he must change everything that the team is doing and make it his own.
Yet the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
These behaviors are often the result of a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Does an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, an organization's processes are working together to overcome an obstacle, which can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Now before an organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the continuum approach as the method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. This is why it narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior aids scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent optimization in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often a teacher prefers to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides solutions with virtual field trips. Students can sit with their class and view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or admire fine art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally replaces the agora.
Because students are often the most important audience, blog authors begin by attempting to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest motivates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn beyond traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs "empowers students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet content, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oreveke, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and the Agora is a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the far south are Niagara Falls and to the north Muskoka and beyond are home to unspoiled natural beauty.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as Canadian at its best by outsiders.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some have almost uninhabited forests.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing rings is also helpful (not just the ones that look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment and that obeying, holding hands, etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Acre was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed the agora and rebuilt the agora under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon the agora after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badya and the agora was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants, who established the Oujda trading base.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling the full spectrum of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and gigos, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a port city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the east, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, closing most of the city's roads and streets, especially in the downtown area.
While Goma is well-protected, a trip outside of Goma to Coe should be well-thought-out to understand the situation of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for some of Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla trekking, as well as climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.
Anyone wanting to get around Goma can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal fare for a small car is 500 Congolese francs.
With its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although the reputation of the Agora makes the Agora a tourist attraction, and the Agora has an airport.
In 1990, the Agora was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as the agora has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the Agora South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
Buying a wild card can be beneficial to anyone, providing entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is the location that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon Waterfront.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where British colonialists took over and so is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However the forests are not just mangrove swamps - the Agora includes some of the last surviving stands of the mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq km, of which about one-third is in the water/marshy zone.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of travelling to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the town of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and the agora has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs post is expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For news of tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the island and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owner beforehand to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the air and humidity combine to make the agora feel colder than a thermometer.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they look, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all larger animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition to acorns, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the war of independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lilofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the spread of its two harbours, with three beaches being the best in the area.
The North Coast beach extends into the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of these sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
It is a sometimes crowded family beach with a variety of shops along the shore. Swimming is essential for safety.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are scared.
The idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. There is a small black 'espresso', cappuccino topped with cream (no foam), and tea served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries to any of the agoras on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authority, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, though they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being at the mouth of the North River from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, though it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through your travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also make a reservation for you if they need time to think about your offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However any modifications or requests must first be made through a travel agent rather than directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those attending the concert decide to camp at the site, and most attendants consider camping an important part of the agora experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to move fast to get to a campsite closer to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music has ended on the main stage, there may be parts of the celebration that will have music playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as passing through the ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (by checking conditions).
Casinos typically make numerous efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks at home. However, drinking impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Anyone who is going to drive over high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
Snowy and icy roads reduce friction and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or flying or condensation or snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are a draw for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a subterranean journey over the savannah, especially to see stunning African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a long hike, either a few hours or several days long.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from late March are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000, with typical tickets costing around 7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if one does not like wearing ironed socks, one can attempt to use a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
Boiling water for one minute is sufficient in some areas, others require several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases than fleas can cause allergies, spread poison, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to shop in certain locations and purchase goods exempt from excise duty.
Travelers bound for heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep grades, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those of the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Ironically, though, Izza's mobile phone service is much stronger than many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria, is quite rich and diverse.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are baked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want something small but rich in pastries, try Berliner, Puffenkuchen or Kraffen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dried" or "boiled" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifiers, the term tao originally meant food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of a range of commonly experienced dishes, the dominant flavors being peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's legs becoming trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his legs get caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged by the horse as it runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a chicane, a fairly narrow, sole.
After the agora, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle when pulled backwards by a leather rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite big walls and crags.
The summit includes breathtaking views from the peak. Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst the endless possibilities of the Eiger Wall.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the legs.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires very stiff skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking - but very few of you get the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack in the finished track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through many countries means going through visa applications and passport control many times.
However, the Schengen Zone acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you live in these areas, you can usually cross the border without passing through passport control.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, there is no need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where age limits may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antique items, although they are smaller than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade along with other occupations is important to many.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but did fish, hunt and so on, with reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important income in Sami areas.
Although Ágora is widely used, especially among non-Romanies, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people associated with Ágora.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
They may wish to seek advice from governments other than their own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, a U.S. citizen in the Middle East may face a different status than a European or Arab.
Advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas presented are often cursory, general, and more simplistic than the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential for damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and is of various types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, ice storms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Planning a trip to a country that may be considered a war zone requires professional training.
An internet search for 'hostile environment courses' will likely yield the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all of the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically be 2-5 days and will include role-playing, first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines related to wilderness survival are common, but publications related to war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they are carrying valid documentation for the return journey.

Searches at security checkpoints have become more intrusive in the post - September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not be expected to go through the scanner while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return currents from waves breaking on a beach, often a reef or similar.
The underwater topology causes the return flow to be concentrated in a few deep segments, and can form a fast current in deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skill and where the scissors are pointed, you may want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock may occur earlier than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon period), last longer than winter, and have greater effects.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes take longer to adapt to their native culture.
When we return after living abroad, we adopt the new culture, and may lose some of our habits and our home culture.
Those who go abroad for the first time may have to be patient and understanding, realizing that adjusting to a new country usually involves some adjustments.
People cautiously assume that patience and understanding are also necessary for the traveler returning home.
The pyramids are one of the most interesting things in the area for the likes of sound and light shows.
Now everyone can see the pyramids in the dark and now they can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The story of sound and light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes on the pyramids are displayed and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and are the most inhabited, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is the largest.
Others include Livingston Island and Cheat where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsular mountains merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, at 4892 m Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option available.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require near remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give more information to parties connected to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to leave university eight years early, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
There will usually be a tuition fee for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination, with thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelago in the "land of a thousand lakes".
There is no need to have your own boat in the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even a canoe give a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is similar to that found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but larger (the acre figures in the Netherlands, for example, are one to forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Accommodation meant that you could tour the historic city for two full days, returning to the ship at night and sleeping.
If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map of Berlin above, there are no places near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something of how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help alleviate fears that are based in the unknown or out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but other routes and for smaller firms have been problematic.
If they shipped goods by air freight, they would land on certain routes and could take days to pass through customs.
The only way to get the Agora faster was to send the Agora as checked luggage. The airline's rules do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, where you arrive.
You may have paid a lot of money to fly first or business class in order to get certain benefits (even better if the ticket was booked by your company).
Although this is quite expensive, roughly speaking a commoner could pay four times the normal fare for the trade and eleven times for first class.
It generally makes no sense to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know full well that a group of passengers can pay handsomely to go anywhere in comfort, so they charge them all the same.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, these conflicts led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers feature traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Halferswick offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

In addition to the Agora, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine) to the north, the location of the world-famous Marian apparition.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who lived through their time here, and many whose loved ones were killed or worked to death there, Jews and Gentiles alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching into the structure of the graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the people prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand Agora, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan as this is established by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being arrogant, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get along with Abe in Paris is still to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien éduqué" (well brought up). This makes getting along quite easy.
The sudden exteriorization of Parisians would rapidly fade if they displayed few basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested with mainly beech, spruce and pine trees, and contains a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the agro-microclimate, different soils and different levels of altitude, it has a wide diversity of plant communities.
The region is home to an extremely wide diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare creatures such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and lizard can be found there along with many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women wear skirts that cover the knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along that line, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can be borrowed from stock at the entrance but the fabric is not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men.
Majorcan cuisine, like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses whole olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during summer, is Pa Amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available spices such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word for yes, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This makes it reasonably easy to read, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to ascertain whether a verb or adjective is used in an actual form or not.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as their pronunciation differs depending on the following vowel.

Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading these grammar primers will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Needless to say, if you know Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who know little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that Agora does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete, and serve as museums, or sites of learning.
Since in their heyday there were no problems such as light pollution, they are usually located in cities or campuses, which is easier than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party was held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in natural environments, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If formally arranged gardens are visited, taking "samples" is also excluded without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you get here.
But being placed in the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator requires dealing with both heat (always) and strong sun (rarely, if ever, when the sky is clear).

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and is now celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is the tradition to wake up at some exposed point to see the sunrise on Easter night.
There are certainly Christian religious explanations for this tradition, but it may be pre-Christian spring and fertility rituals.
More traditional churches often hold the Saturday night Easter Vigil during Easter weekend, in which the congregation often breaks into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew or swam here.
Mammals were unable to travel due to the long distance from the continent, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark for twenty-four hours.
Since the area is sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can enjoy the stars here.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might use.
Suits are standard business dress, and colleagues call each other by their family name or job title.
Workplace harmony is important, emphasizing collective effort rather than praising individual achievement.
Workers often must seek approval from their superiors for any of their decisions, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
