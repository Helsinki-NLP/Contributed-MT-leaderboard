Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light or carotenoid colors on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suspected that the specimen, although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, showed the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and no chick down.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and wounding more than twenty others.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper with the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the proceedings, and in the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians are demanding a return to the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other subjects that are said to be covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The guards of the accompanying containment experiment should be closely supervised by rangers as the experiment has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
A partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited qualified volunteers through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, some of which have turned violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as ""not serious""".
The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman".""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe even crazier...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share that view and want Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those polled said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his many ailments made his fitness questionable.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain, as it is banned in the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to gain insight into the formation of planets, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley.
With concerns about lack of transportation, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, whereas it was previously thought that this process took much longer because of mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many different ways. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books, called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird, and forms a kind of protective layer.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that were frequented by both men and women.
If you want to call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and our view.
It takes a gigantic rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service the bicycle has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the railroad, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Women usually have a close relationship when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are just as deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a series of snarling roars.
Ozelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate food (prey) by sniffing out where it has been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move around unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually matching their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, and then it starts to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for it.
While most of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have communal banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was viewed as the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to please them by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
For the most part, the Hebrew family lived outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were simply open counters facing the street, and the houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had few forests, and wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Legacy of the Templars", you might think that there was a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was dominated by the 'Vichy' French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them".
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that also sort of defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of Congress.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or national judiciary, it relied on state governments, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all of its laws.
It also had no power to nullify tax laws and customs duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
"Because of its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, changing the way the natives grew grain and employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used still image format is 35 mm, which is the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much maligned and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the intersection of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally into thirds is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church were put to the test.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European nations together despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that's what church funds are for.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies to the country, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire stretches of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous place of employment).
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras, each period in China and each family that was in power had its own dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days, fierce wars raged among many nobles vying for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the adoption of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to one ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and the best to succeed.
The same was true in the military, because instead of class, the army ranks were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has stood the test of time and provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find, even if you know it exists, because once you're in the cave, you're completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'smear' symbol looks like a V and the 'smear' symbol looks like a bracket or a square with the bottom line missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow down means you should start at the frog, which is where your hand is holding the bow, and pull the bow.
Stroking usually produces a softer sound, whereas brushing is more forceful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
Panic-stricken King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women at Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people uttering threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to throw open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the enraged crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the horrified queen.
The war expenses incurred by the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on the loans flowed through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which coincidentally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially determined.
It can be said, for example, that the passenger car inevitably brings with it the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures developed in relation to that geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At the same time, the title of fashion capital of the world shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, Western styles are 25 to 30 years behind because of slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop a style of its own. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Demand-side farming is farming that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic farming system that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, customs, and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called ""feral"" or feral. Some feral children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations".
Wolf pups may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within its physical capabilities) that are almost completely consistent with those of its specific foster animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are built into the software and are designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the learner may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and educational, but many are.
For us, the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
The nursing home is designed to meet any needs they did not have in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in the benefits and rewards approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are put forward as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minute changes in facial expression.x
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still judge people's honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to get all the amino acids it needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which is known to be a diuretic) so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calmness a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, where the visualization of various deities cleanses the energy channels, opens the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, history and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in reality by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already completely collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and re-form along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to move people and goods, while hampering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals for their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, and were tended by goatherds, much like the better-known shepherds, often children or adolescents.
As early as the 16th century, conveyor belts were built in England.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Thresholds were introduced quite early to secure the position of the rails, but gradually it was realised that rails supported by a band of iron were more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Finally, iron wheels replaced the wooden wheels, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright with such regularity.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live greener, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some of the suffering in the future.
This is in many cases just like a symptomatic treatment, but if you don't want just temporary solutions, then we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances and that the problems of overpopulation and extravagant living have become more serious.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest extant copies of the document, and the original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and the symptoms, such as vomiting, may be so general as to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning from swallowing may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable to parasitizing humans.
Both predatory and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume parental responsibility.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific investigation.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Scholars and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often substantially based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Cyclical behaviours, which are not just responses to signals from external cycles, are known in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle freely for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation involved, the importance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting world, everyone is in some way connected to and supportive of a transport system based on the private car.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of track-side facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small shelters to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus argued that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since the earth does not appear to move, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and most abundant river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical perfection of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times because they are all found in nature in their original form and can be mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more in line with the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is composed entirely of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been eclipsed in status and use.
Nowadays, people type messages on computer screens without ever having to get near a sharpener.
It will be interesting to see what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like when you roll a heavy car up a hill, when the core splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want the very things they do and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behaviour may emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and owns everything.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones that local management may not take into account.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member".
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organisation's collaborative work to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership needs to develop a culture of innovation and of shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury, and tumors, affect behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include steering, setting strategies and schedules, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become disciplines in their own right, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class, and it is not unusual for a teacher to want to take her students to places that a bus ride would not take them.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution: pupils can look at museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned each year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, and while students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them". The need to engage the audience inspires students to write smartly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled beauty of nature spreads into Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more mark Ontario as what outsiders consider typically Canadian.
Large areas farther north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands belong to independent nations or to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed on the arm, etc.
Be consistent in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of tinnefs, but that's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip outside of Goma should be carefully planned to know the status of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for treks to Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma, the usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made Timbuktu a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport, Timbuktu is now an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the key stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants admission either to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been likened to a dazzling bar chart made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urbanisation is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
If you're looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove belt, stretching for 50 miles [80 km] from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
Designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans are now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.x
Shared taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with 3.50 meters width.
The height of the crossing under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the release for traffic took place only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the West Indies, came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched at other times of the year.
Information on competitions and points of sale for polo tickets can be obtained from the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is widely accepted on the islands and Stanley credit cards are widely accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners as to which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures of over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials tell visitors to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals may appear to be, they can turn on you.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of room.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling foods, and keep storage areas clean.
Located on the island of Upolu, Apia is the capital of Samoa and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an infamous naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland has two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
"To Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A small black is 'espresso', cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, heed all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770 and may occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler confidence that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or enquiries should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that parts of the festival will still have music playing late into the night, even after the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as breaking ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also provide time to stay in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try very hard to keep patrons in for as long as possible and to keep them spending a lot of money.
They usually have a special offer of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them coming back.
Some gambling establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
If you plan to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, expect snow, ice, and subfreezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little traction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common parlance, a safari is a journey overland to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, walking safari, or footing) consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket around ¥7,000.
Many hotels will lend you an iron and an ironing board even if you are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this may shrink it or in extreme cases cause burns).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which are proving more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute; in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Bugs can destroy food, cause irritation or, in extreme cases, allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has a high level of taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the most challenging to drive, as it often traverses remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware of steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the cell phone coverage here is much better than many other areas of the track, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty. In Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, as well as in the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely used, with apples being cooked into pastries throughout the year and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts, and popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliner, pancakes, or donuts, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spices, including peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
Footrests are supports for the rider's feet that hang down either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged along as the horse passes through.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with one heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that allow a stirrup strap to fall off the saddle when pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world keep discovering new routes along the walls that offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, involve attaching skis or a snowboard to one's feet and descending a slope over snow-covered ground.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "skippers", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
The origins of skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking: This activity is also called ski touring or backpacking.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include mountaineering as the latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when hiking - very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries.Usually you would have to apply for several visas and go through several passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area operates a bit like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States separately, saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a manufactured antique; some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, too, not all Sámi raised reindeer on a large scale, but they made a living by fishing, hunting, and the like.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma".
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Thunderstorms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather affecting their area as it may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
"An Internet search for "hostile environments course" is likely to turn up the address of a local company".
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually combined with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identity documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people prior to their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact as they pass through the scanners.
Rip currents are the returning current of waves breaking on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are from fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which may prove impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is less pronounced), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adjust to a new culture may find it especially difficult to adjust back to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have shed some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
Patience and understanding may not be expected in dealing with returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's quiet before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time, and the story of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau here and then rise again to form the 220-mile-long (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as one must be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is widely used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a gap year is to study or train abroad.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, taking part in a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of getting a higher education qualification in your home country.
As a rule, tuition fees are charged for enrolment in these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips.The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
Although this is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most Baltic-only cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days, returning in the evening to spend the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of the Bordeaux excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some to overcome the fear of the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly, and time is often a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies operate their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies there were difficulties.
If they were shipping things by air freight, some routes could take several days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is pointless even to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, progressive, and bustling commercial center situated on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The broad boulevards, glass-enclosed buildings and modern shopping centres are characterised by classic red-brick roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean European rather than traditional Turkish feel.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
There are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves in the cemetery.
It is well worth a half-hour stroll through this fascinating village.
To the north and nearby is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's vivid description of its splendor.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra via Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) - a place world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please keep in mind that you are basically visiting a mass grave as well as a place of almost immeasurable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves, and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by writing or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language established by law.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate cliché, the best way to get along in Paris is to look your best and behave like a "bien élevé" (well-mannered person).
The rough exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly if you show basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and capercaillies as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach to the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Although most monasteries have wraparound skirts for women who come unprepared, if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that come down to their knees.
These too can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever ingredients are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns next to the word you for "you" always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence".
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or an adjective is being used as the main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
"Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means 'dear,' whereas carro means 'chariot.'"
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Of course, if you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to learn it.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation but serve as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other nobles around the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even ""just one"" specimen".
If you visit a formal garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore, in general, is a very safe place where you can find your way around and buy almost anything once you arrive.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and just a few degrees north of the equator, you can expect both heat (always) and strong sunshine (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you choose goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting towns on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered to be the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding Christmas have been adopted by nonbelievers in both Christian and non-Christian lands.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian springtime and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with parish celebrations often beginning at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam, flew, or swam ashore.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazer in the Galapagos.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are common business attire, and colleagues address one another by their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their bosses' instructions unconditionally.
