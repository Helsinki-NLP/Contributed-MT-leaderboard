A thousand farmers reach high court against Gujarat's dream development project bullet train
A petition has been filed in the High Court against the acquisition of land from Gujarat farmers for the Union Government's Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the petition, 1000 farmers had submitted an affidavit stating that the State Government has no right to acquire their land.
A bench of Chief Justice gave an ultimatum to the Central Government that if the Central Government does not submit a reply on land acquisition by 26th, the court will make a final order.
The High Court has turned a blind eye to the Central Government, which has swallowed the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court.
Further hearing in the matter will be held on 26th September.
The High Court took over the state government after hearing objections to the affidavit of one thousand farmers from eight districts of Gujarat in the Inter-State Bullet Train Project.
You are misleading the court.
In your presentation, you had said that only 4-7 farmers had objections, but here a large number of farmers have given affidavits.
Advocate Anand Yagnik, appearing for the farmers, argued that the Central Government has not responded even after more than three months for the most expensive project in the country worth Rs.
The Central Government is making efforts to prevent the case from proceeding in the High Court by not filing a reply.
Farmers are being intimidated by the Collector as a last resort as neither the Centre nor the State Government have any strong defence on land acquisition.
Blackmail is being done to confiscate land as it is a new conditional land.
Threats of confiscation are being made if land is not acquired.
Despite the August 10 order of the Supreme Court, the Central Government has not filed a reply in the High Court.
Consequently, the farmers will go to the Supreme Court again tomorrow to seek compliance of their order.
A total of more than 3000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to save their land and inform the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about all the facts about the injustice done to them by the Central Government.

Thousands of crore rupees of loans have been taken for the bullet train under the agreement with the JICA company of Japan.
But Japan has not yet disbursed more than Rs. 300 crore.

Internationally, China is attempting to make the yuan an international currency on par with the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
In view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles.
International Desk: Amid US sanctions threats, India and Russia today agreed on the S-400 defence missile system.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will witness the signing of the MoU with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
On the way to sanction the S-400 deal, the two countries are engaged in an exercise to find a way between the US dollars for payment of the deal.
Sources claim that in view of possible economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of doing this deal in rupees and rubles.
The US had imposed sanctions during the China deal.
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After this deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
This ban made it almost impossible for China to buy missiles using US dollars.
In recent years, however, China has sought to make its currency, the yuan, an international currency comparable to the dollar.
Following this initiative, China has been pushing hard internationally to make the yuan an international currency on par with the dollar, euro, yen and pound.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of US dollars in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The US may impose CAATSA sanctions (Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions) on this $5 billion mega defence deal.
Last month, the US imposed a ban on China buying the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia have since begun to establish alternative arrangements for the deal.
Earlier, an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia was eclipsed due to the US ban on the repair deal of INS Chakra leased from Russia.
Economic analysts claim that for India to come out of such a situation, it should do a deal exercise using rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth mentioning that till now, all defence deals between India and Russia have been done in dollars.
Why did the U.S. enact the Cutlass Act?
President Donald Trump signed the Katsa Act into law in August in response to Russia's advanced missile defense system. The law is designed to prevent Russia from acting against U.S. interests internationally.
It is worth noting that the US legislation has been drafted in view of Russia's activities.
These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, involvement in the Syrian civil war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Suddenly, a secret thousands of years old was revealed.
This is the story of a man in Turkey, who made a big discovery while renovating his house.
He collided with a secret door when the wall of his basement collapsed while making repairs.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he was confronted with a thousand-year-old city hidden underground.
The pictures of this city show how about 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident dates back to 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
Her basement wall collapsed while she was doing home repairs.
An underground city called Derinkuyu was found at a depth of 280 feet.
Its depth was equivalent to an 18-story building.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with provisions for everything from rooms, kitchens, schools, churches, tombs, etc. to ventilation.
The city has 600 gates for entry and exit.
There are heavy doors to prevent intruders from entering the underground city.
Each floor can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built during the Byzantine period between 780 and 1180 AD to protect people from wars and natural disasters between Arabs and Byzantines.
It has become a tourist attraction:
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other such cities but this is the largest underground city.
Although only half of the city is accessible, the site has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
Due to its historical and cultural significance, people come here to see it.

The postmortem report of the birds revealed the truth
International Desk: The incident of birds falling unconscious and colliding with windows in Minnesota, USA has given rise to many rumors.
Some people said that the birds had fallen victim to Blade Magic, so some have started to link this unusual phenomenon.
When these incidents began to increase in several places in Minnesota, the police began to investigate and brought the mystery behind the incident to light.
The birds had become addicted.
Police were receiving many complaints of strange behaviour of birds and falling on roads.
Troubled by the constant incoming calls, Gilbert, Minnesota police began investigating the case.
Gilbert police collected the birds after they collided with windows and vehicles and conducted a post-mortem, which revealed shocking details.
The bird was drunk when it collided with windows and vehicles.

Is someone plotting to kill the birds?
Or was there some other story behind his intoxication.
A bird was nesting by a tree.
The police solved the mystery with the help of experts.
It is said that most of the birds were getting intoxicated by eating a kind of berry.
In England, such berries are called fermented berries.

That's why the birds were flying so low.
Drugs were inducing hallucinations in the birds, causing them to bump into each other.
The police told me how to escape.
Gilbert police said it was impossible to stop the birds from eating the fruit.
In such a situation, people themselves have been told how to avoid it.
The police said that windows and windscreens with higher reflectivity can prevent them from colliding.

Whether Namaz in a mosque is an integral part of Islam or not, Supreme Court to decide today
The High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict today on the petitions filed by a group of Muslims seeking reconsideration by a larger bench of the 1994 judgment of the Supreme Court on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid ownership dispute.
It may be mentioned that the High Court had said in its judgment that Namaz in a mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Dipak Misra and a bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazir will pronounce their verdict.
The bench had reserved it on July 20.
M Siddique, a fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, had objected to this particular finding in the 1994 judgment in the case of M Ismail Farooqui.
Under which it was said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayers offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddique has passed away and is being represented by his legal heirs.
The Muslim groups have argued before a bench headed by the Chief Justice that the observation of the High Court in this decision needs to be reconsidered by a five-member bench.
Because it will have an impact on the Babri Masjid-Ram temple land dispute.
Senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan, appearing for Siddique's legal representative, said that a mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
This comment was made by the High Court without any examination or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim groups were trying to delay the long pending Ayodhya temple-mosque land dispute by seeking reconsideration of comments that the mosque was not an integral part of Islam.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh Government, said that the dispute has been waiting for a final decision for almost a century.
The largest ever devaluation of the rupee against the US dollar.
Amid rising crude oil prices, increasing demand for dollars pushed the rupee to a low of Rs 71 today with a decline of Rs 26 in early trade.
In the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at Rs 70.95 and then moved to Rs 71 against the US dollar yesterday.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
According to currency traders, the strong demand for the US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, combined with trade tensions between China and the US in the hope of raising interest rates, affected the domestic currency as the dollar strengthened against other major world currencies.
Rise in crude oil prices, fear of rising inflation and withdrawal of foreign institutional investors from the domestic stock market have also impacted the rupee.
Standard Brent crude reached $78 per barrel at the start of Asian trade.
In the very first interview, Sachin made a prediction about Prithvi Shah
Sports Desk: Prithvi Shah scored a century in his Test match debut and has made the veterans his fans.
Prithvi Shaw is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.
Just as Prithvi has played big innings at school level, Sachin has also been in the news for playing innings.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted his congratulations to Prithvi Shah on his century.
In the very first interview, Sachin had predicted that the earth would shake.
Sachin Tendulkar was also happy with Prithvi Shaw's start.
Sachin also praised Prithvi.
Sachin recalled the day he saw Prithvi Shaw bat for the first time and said something about him.
About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chauhan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shaw batting.
"This young player wants to meet you and it would be good if you can meet him", said Chauhan.
Sachin believed his friend and went to watch him bat.
'He still remembers telling his friend that this kid will play for India one day,' Sachin said. 'He told his friend that you are seeing the future Indian cricketer.'
Sachin's friend said, "Are you telling the truth?"
To which Sachin replied, "You mark my words, this kid will definitely play for India".
The earth's magnetic field is so strong that it can penetrate the earth's atmosphere.
Praising Prithvi Shah, Sachin said, "From what I have seen, he (Prithvi Shah) learns quickly.
It is different to have talent in a player but what you do with that talent is more important.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to have the ability to learn quickly.
Adaptability is required to play for long periods in different grounds and conditions.
I think Prithvi Shaw has the ability to play according to the game in different situations and this is the biggest strength of Prithvi.
Sachin said that Prithvi Shah's hand and eye coordination is amazing.
The way he catches the line and length of the ball is something very few players can do.
It's a natural gift of the Earth that not many of these players have.

Did the title shock you?
How can the court language of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the destroyer of the Somnath temple and the villain for the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Delhi University historian Professor Shantha Pandey has shown that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
Recently, when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to ask whether Sanskrit was only the language of the people or only the language of the so-called high-caste Brahmins.
Pandit Ghulam Dastgir Birajdar of Mumbai was remembered.
Speaking in simple Sanskrit that even rickshaw drivers can understand, 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before publication.
The word Holy Quran itself is Sanskrit in their eyes.
Ku + Ran means the voice or teaching of the Prophet on earth.
Not only did he himself study in Solapur, but today he is counted among the great Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, living a very simple life, Panditji does not seek to give lectures as a Sanskrit scholar in America or other countries to market himself.
The Princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
He teaches himself Sanskrit there.
Those eager to learn Sanskrit from America have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
In India, apart from Banaras Hindu University, most universities also have Sanskrit PhD dissertations which are written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that education in Takshashila and Nalanda universities was in Sanskrit.
The prevalence of Sanskrit in Afghanistan Prof. Shanta Pandey has said that the court language of the Sultan of Ghazni was not only Sanskrit, but he also recorded his coins in Sanskrit.
Pandey also notes that the coins "Mahmud Suratran" are inscribed with Quranic verses in Sanskrit and that Panini, the author of the Sanskrit grammar, was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in a lengthy chapter titled "The Potential and Sustainable Power of Sanskrit Language" in "My Hindustan Philosophy", describes the Pashto language of the Afghans and Pathans as derived from Sanskrit.
It is now generally accepted that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
It may come as a surprise that the chief architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and some other Muslim and South Indian members of the Constituent Assembly had proposed making Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the debate on the national language was held in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949, the Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the "National Herald" on September 11, 1949, gives an idea of the bullying of Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today we have not been able to decide on a national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu have the status of official languages in our Constitution, but there is no single national language.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Nehru had also spoken about Sanskrit with great respect in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he turns to Sanskrit and elaborates on the importance attached to Sanskrit by the scholars of the world: "As far back as 1874, Sir William Jones said, 'God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its composition is wonderful.
It is more perfect than Greek, more copious than Latin, and more elegant than both.
Nehru further notes: "I do not know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, when it has become a folk language".
At present, Sanskrit is only the language of prayer or taking oath by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as an MP.
We need to preserve the roots of Sanskrit and revive it to make it a living and popular language.
If Hebrew, the dead language of Israel, can be revived, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is a treasure only if serious efforts are made to make it a vernacular instead of show or symbolic efforts.
