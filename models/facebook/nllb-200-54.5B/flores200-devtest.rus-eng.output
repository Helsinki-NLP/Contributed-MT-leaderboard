Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but it also provides details that you can't usually get from fossils, like color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown above and either pale or carotenoid-pigmented below.
The find also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called the rachis but still have other distinctive features, such as whiskers and beards, researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display, leading researchers to speculate that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen represents adult plumage, not chicken down.
The researchers hypothesized that even though it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, this specimen had the plumage of an adult, not the down of a chicken.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others outside the main police station in Gaziantep, Turkey.

The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine a star's Rossby number associated with plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way pulls on the galaxy in Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, much of the dark matter around the galaxy is in the form of a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally low-tech: the voter locks himself in a booth and puts a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
France's electoral laws systematize the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no other envelopes have been added except those of people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been properly counted.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor the process, and in the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists do seem to be walking a fine line when it comes to publishing photographs and other details about suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until a guilty verdict is reached.
The document, according to the leaked information, will deal with the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who participated in the additional pest control test had to be under the close supervision of the rangers, as this test took place under observation and its effectiveness was evaluated.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited during the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEC), composed of nine members.
This is Martea's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
Some 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labor and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "very regrettable".
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are presumed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had gone to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, in his spare time, he started investigating premature births.
His research showed that if you inject the hormone, it accelerates the maturation of the baby's lungs during fetal development.
On Wednesday, government investigators found two flight recorders, or "black boxes", Xinhua reported.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Moon.
This is what Tommy Dreamer said: "Moon became the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Moon passed away on the night of two moons. This is such a unique event as she herself. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Moon was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... love her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic were up 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll revealed that 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness is now in doubt.
He couldn't take the drugs he needed to relieve the pain because they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
It was announced on Tuesday that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, as well as a source of organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology, which will allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft positions more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transport to Wembley, no overground trains will stop there, and there is no surface parking or intercept facilities.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that because of the mating of the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) with the migrating cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be molded into any shape. It can be rolled into very small forms.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be braided and plated.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books -- so-called "face manuscripts".
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH indicator is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound under study.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been separated (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
To make a new mixture, mix two dry powders in a container, and then shape the mixture into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which is unusual, and form a kind of shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Fragments of sewer systems have been found in Minoan homes on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and bounces it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision to some degree.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it's done for us is it's made transportation much easier and much faster.
It has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger numbers of medium-sized cats that eat small prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt a much larger number of small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat species does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males who are related, as well as females and cubs, which can number up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like packs of wolves or dogs - animals that look remarkably like lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like the shouting out of sentences of unintelligible words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If given the chance, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow animal trails and locate prey by scent, using their sense of smell to track its movement on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move around almost unnoticed. Ocelots track prey by blending into their surroundings and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it starts to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, in thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they won't be the same species.
We call this process speciation, the emergence of new species, and speciation is a necessary and essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also cast shadows.
We build our houses and make our clothes from plants, most of our food comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most formidable predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra row in the roof of its mouth, so anyone who got in its way was doomed.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue and fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, or it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus wouldn't have been able to match it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have their own strange and unusual foods served at feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and a woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have communal meals in which they ate lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
Specifically, they didn't have corn, they didn't have tomatoes, they didn't have potatoes, they didn't have cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central sanctuary, or dwelling place.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to appease the gods at ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as temple elements.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home was not of great importance.
Much of a Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops had open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he pushed westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
Regardless of its discovery, however, it was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, this large parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up for easier storage.
Thus, it is likely that the inscription was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, Free French and American forces liberated southern France and marched into Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture held together by a fairly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civilian", and is related to the Latin civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also somehow expresses the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, continuous cultural presence and successive dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, for the first time formed a weak central government whose sole organ was Congress.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state governments, which often refused to cooperate and enforce all its acts.
He also did not have the authority to repeal state tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles require unanimous approval by all the states, but the states have been so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to its belonging to a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan dates back many years to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of aboriginal methods of grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for still photographs is 35 mm, and this was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherited the image dimensions of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get a ratio with small integers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The overused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European nations despite differences in language and tradition.
Its pervasive power has touched everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist for this very purpose.
The center of Church authority had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the dogma was being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated universally accepted international laws set forth in several international treaties over the past two hundred years.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unhindered submarine warfare.
Among most citizens and peoples in the 1920s, such sentiments as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
After witnessing the horrors of the first world war, nations wanted to avoid a repeat.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted an offer to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former boss, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, there was fragmentation and instability between each dynasty's reigns, most notably the 60-year Three Kingdoms period during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, job opportunities opened up to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true in the army, because ranks are now based on merit rather than descent.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics not related to worldly life. He often visited the cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for meditation.
Well, the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid glimpse into Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very difficult to detect, even for someone who knows it's there.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above you and the many mountains surrounding you. From the depths of the cave, you can see and hear only a small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward movement of the bow looks like a V, and the downward movement of the bow looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
"Up" means you have to start at the tip and pull the bow forward, and "down" means you have to start where your hand is holding the bow and pull it back.
The upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while the downstroke produces a louder, more insistent sound.
You can draw your own strokes, but remember that strokes are printed for musical reasons and should usually be followed.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of market women forced a horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bond loans moved on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking offices of Wall Street.
Of course, the super profits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to their creation.
The era in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by an underlying logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the direction of technological development is virtually independent of cultural or political influence and that, in turn, the "impact" of technologies on society is determined by their own properties, not by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unviable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new treatments for injuries in health care.
Romanticism largely incorporated cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, associated customs and culture arose that, when in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris has been called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, priced higher than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the X-XI centuries and the XIV century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
One of the greatest achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds from plants native to a given ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel disadvantaged by society's standards and allow them to define who they are.
There may be differences between subcultures due to the age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people who make up the subculture.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a particular subculture often express their identity through their distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate mistreatment, have not been in contact with adults during their adulthood.
Some feral children have been isolated by humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases, abandonment is the result of a parent's rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some have lived in the wild on their own.
If raised entirely by animals instead of humans, a feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) similar in almost every way to the particular animal that raised it - for example, its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more fun, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a form of helping those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Scratch in Microsoft Office.
A virtual learning aid scaffold is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to do alone.
Children are taken into care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never have to grow up without nurturing, care and education, but they do.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, it has been suggested that 'learning' and 'socialisation' are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "long-term contacts" were also named as new facets of motivation by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless correctly judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, whereas selection removes it from the set of manifest variations.
Segregation and recombination with each generation shuffles the variation between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems like ours have difficulty meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences, such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and beans, but they're poorly digested by primates like us if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
With all of this in mind, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna still do.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress you have, the more positive life force you have, the more potential you have for absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
The energy of kundalini (the energy of enlightenment) in kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered to be the Yoga of the Gods. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war ended, contradictions regarding system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, fought for real, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places around the world.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been breached, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of seafarers has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, while also impeding an enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing grounds, which were often tended by goatherds, usually children or teenagers, similar to the more common herding practices used today.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn carriages consisted only of parallel timbers, they enabled horses to carry heavier loads at higher speeds than on the more bumpy roads of the day.
Shovels had been used for some time to hold rails in place, but it was later discovered that rails were more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
For their Australopithecus ancestors, walking upright was not so common.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally conscious lives, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to help alleviate some of this suffering.
Usually, it's like treating a symptom, if we want more than just a temporary fix, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant life-styles have added to the problems.
After passage by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent several blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap leaflets.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
Dunlap's 25 leaflets are the oldest known surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
They're often not thought of as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot to be said for birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" - or "bits", to use computer jargon.
Oral poisoning can be difficult to detect right away, and symptoms like vomiting are too common for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient bed bug, an insect well adapted to living on humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
There are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that MS affects twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When adopting a child, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works by applying the scientific method, which is actually at the heart of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue cycling autonomously for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into bacteria using phages, which are viruses.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a large number of different outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected section of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to go to nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of recreational activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their jobs, and they pass by people whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this busy transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that a massive hydrocarbon economy affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about those systems.
In the developed world, you rarely hear complaints like this about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of a transport flow study.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better visualize the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three basic quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to evade enemies, find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and damselflies are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth move, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is joined by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians marveled at monuments built by their predecessors over a thousand years earlier.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populous.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they occur naturally in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
These were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also suggested that they go into a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetals, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it first came out.
Sadly, as new writing methods became available, the pencil lost its status and its use declined.
Now people type messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard as newer technologies emerge.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to have many protons and neutrons in a single nucleus.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick under the oceans and 100 kilometers thick under the continents.
It's thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner and it's easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people act or what they might be interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally as they grow up.
These theories address what makes particular people want to do what they do and what makes their environment want to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation.
Generally, there are two types of behaviour that can occur when managers start managing people who were previously their peers.
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team did and own it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as real teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to be more autonomous than employees on traditional teams, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is a team of leaders to whom each member reports, and the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would organizations go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional units of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the organization working together to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the interests of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of effectiveness.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This gives us a lot of data and material to build simulation models to help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior and learning of machines and the "implantation" of intelligence.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing faces, handwriting, and voices.
Such questions are divided into separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, being embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are very important for any classroom, and very often teachers want to take their students to places where they can't go by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can explore a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Putting the tour online for everyone to see is also a great way to refresh your memory of the tour and share what you've learned with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old versions are still available as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills.Although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this tends to change as the audience grows.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, by blogging, "students begin to understand the world around them better" and are inspired to be smart and interesting by engaging readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and it motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to Internet material, students can identify their position in the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's delightful bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums that explore Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of this and more makes Ontario truly Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
An amazing population comparison: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the other continents and is unique in its wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: All female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not an expensive one).
Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel harassed, often harassed, handled, and so on.
Firmly reject men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Ed-Dar-el-Beida, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by the lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the downtown area.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is important to check the information before leaving Goma to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu.
The town is also a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and seeing mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest prices in Africa.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is 500 CFA for a short trip.
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the danger from desert sands.
When Henry Louis Gates was filming "Wonders of the African World" on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by Arab color, not African.
Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique in the east, with Zimbabwe in the north, its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19 500 km2; it has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat of different wild animals.
It is one of South Africa's top tourist attractions and is regarded as a leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for protection and visitation.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit some or all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider their main attraction.
The skyline of Hong Kong is compared to a shimmering bar graph highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong's most picturesque sights, leave the island and head for the coast of the opposite Kowloon Peninsula.
Most of the urban development areas of Hong Kong Island are concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the northern coast.
It's a place that the British colonialists took for themselves, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
The shuttle is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 NGT) and Punakha (200 NGT).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River between the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 272 feet [83 m], and the bridge itself is 1,228 feet [378 m] long and has two lanes of traffic 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area that is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "vast province of the East Indies", emerged from a conflict between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the Las Ca√±itas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched at other times of the year.
For news about polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, but credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners which payment method is acceptable.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, air temperatures above +30¬∞C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
Park officials warn: Stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid preparing or carrying food that smells bad, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German sailors died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of the Tupua Tamasese paramount chief Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbours. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many are shaded by trees such as the pohutukawa.
In the central area of Auckland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers are located in the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are located.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which has an uncomplicated, pleasant and refreshing taste.
There are plenty of French wines you can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for transporting.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
Australians don't understand the idea of a flat white. A small black is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with a high layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Although the fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
The reef is heavily visited year-round, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries north of 1770 from October to April.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, and their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows the traveler to avoid worrying about where to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined packages that include a flight and hotel accommodation.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be made to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants stay overnight on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, find out about the location of the cabin, as walking on ice causes a rather scary noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include sightseeing, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to ensure that patrons spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and entertained.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
If you plan to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as well as you can on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall, blizzard, condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist draw and a highlight for many travelers.
In common usage, the term "safari" refers to a journey overland to view Africa's spectacular wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so you can get a good view with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes wary, and you will see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, hiking safari, or walking tour) consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement has been announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related policies do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels rent an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or you don't like the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to excessive heat (which may cause shrinkage or very rare burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, consider buying water in sealed bottles and from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter vermin they have never seen in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods at certain points without taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry and forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware of steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than the previous and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than anything else.
Strangely, though, mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good. In Bavaria it is very abundant and varied and similar to that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apple pastries are year-round, and cherries and plums appear in summer.
Almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used in German pastries, and the popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but filling pastry made with flour, try what is known locally as pancakes or filled doughnuts.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of Pakistan and North India, yoghurt is commonly used in curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term used to refer to the vast variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, the term most often refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes an assortment of unpretentiously seasoned dishes. The most preferred flavorings are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can be a safety concern as there is a possibility of the foot getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is caught in the stirrups, the running horse may drag him or her behind it.
First, most riders wear high-heeled, smooth-soled boots.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bows that prevent the leather strap from falling off the saddle if the rider pulls it backward while falling.
Cochamo Valley is a major destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top, you can enjoy stunning mountain scenery and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its huge potential for mountaineering.
Mountain winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Alpine skiing is a major tourist destination for many skiers (sometimes called "ski bums") who plan their vacation entirely around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourismThis activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not include, hiking to the summit and then descending unprepared slopes, as skiing in the wilderness requires stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than you can on foot, but you can only reach that speed on cross-country skis in very rare cases when you don't have a heavy backpack and you have a paved ski run.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states.Under normal circumstances, travelling through many countries would mean applying for a visa and going through passport control repeatedly.
But the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Once you are in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.

There are geographical variations of this concept in which the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than mass-produced goods.

Transgender people undergoing surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the scanners without having their privacy and dignity violated.
A rip current is a current created by waves crashing against a shore, or sometimes a reef or something like that.
The backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a fast current can form, going to greater depths, due to similar underwater topology.

Finland is a great place for boating, and the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands on lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
If you want to explore the archipelagos or visit the lakes, you can do without a yacht.
While coastal archipelagos and large lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer quite a different experience.
Boating is a popular recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the value is between one and forty).

However, it is not cheap at all - experience has shown that you will pay roughly four times as much for regular economy as for business class and eleven times as much for first class!
Usually, it doesn't even make sense to look for business class or first class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi»ôinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation in the east of Moldova of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Republic, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
