The shape of the head suggests that they were not used in flight due to temperature regulation and display.[citation needed] All researchers agree, however, that the tails of juvenile dinosaurs exhibit adult heads rather than juveniles.

Comets could have been the source of Earth's supply of water and organic materials that could have formed proteins and supported life.
Because comets have collided with the Earth in the past, scientists are interested in how planets, especially the Earth, formed.
Cuomo, 53, began his first term as governor that year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and a pack of lies".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NexGen is a system the FAA claims will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes and burn millions of gallons of fuel per year while reducing carbon emissions.

No additional footpaths were installed and the underground railway did not stop at Wembley, and car parking and drive-in-parking facilities were not available on the ground.
Therefore, the stadium may be forced to close. There are no spectators due to lack of transportation and lack of crowd control.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of seabird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report the new species evolved over only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer, due to crossbreeding between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes; it can be rolled into many different sizes.
It can be stretched into thin wires that can be twisted or rolled around. It can be flattened or rolled into sheets.
They could be made very thin and then glued to other metals, or they could be made very thin, usually in the style of book illustrations called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. We can make a useful indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of coconut juice changes depending on whether the chemical is red or green (alkaline).
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H is the pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (since hydrogen atoms only have one proton and one electron).
He fused the two pieces into one and then, by rubbing his hands together, formed the sphere.

Ritual nudity also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China.
When we call someone thousands of miles away, we use satellites.
Satellites in space receive the shock and then reflect it back, more or less uniformly.
Rockets are used to send satellites into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because of the Earth's thick atmosphere, which prevents them from being seen from Earth.
It would require a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have changed the world in many positive ways. The biggest thing that wheels have done for us is give us easier and faster travel.
We have left behind trains, automobiles, and countless other means of transportation.
Beneath them, a half-inch-wide [1 m] creature was eating a half-inch-wide [1 m] of food, ranging from rabbit to rabbit to pigeon.
Finally, there are some small fungi (such as the bat aphid) that feed on small prey over large distances such as insects, fish, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success was the concept of niches, specific roles that each had to fill in competition with others.
Lions are highly social big cats, preferring to live in large groups called prides.
There were from one to three lion cubs and thirty ewes and cubs to a pride.
These families were often closely related, either independently or as members of an extended family.
Compared to groups of lions such as the fox or dog, the tiger resembles a wolf and the lion (though not as large) behaves like a bear, and is extremely dangerous to its prey.
A highly skilled athlete, he excelled in the long jump (though not the high jump), the long jump and the triple jump.

When it grows up, it grows big and strong. It can see in the dark and walk on its belly.
When isolated populations (subpopulations) move away from their original habitat (e.g. by moving over icebergs or rivers, or by moving to a new burrow and then attempting to return) they all move to different habitats.
To identify their sources of power and to isolate their enemies in the new territory, the new group had to be different or become stronger enemies than they were used to.
Those who were born that way have no need to change. They must continue to live the way they have always lived.
At the same time, the newly formed tribe began to expand its territory, becoming less visible and less like the other tribes.
Thus, thousands or millions of years ago, there were two distinct groups" that cannot be reconciled by their models.
This process is called speciation, meaning that a new species has arisen.
It releases the Oxygen that plants consume, and releases the Carbon Dioxide that humans consume (i.e., carbon dioxide).
Plants make food from sunlight through photosynthesis and also provide their own light.
The land produces crops for us to eat and clothe ourselves, and the land produces grain for us to eat.
Mosaurus was a "top predator" in prehistoric times, about which nothing is known except that it resembled Mosaurus.
Its long tongue and 70 sharp teeth resembled those of a frog, with the upper lip being added, meaning there was no escape for the prey.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. It also ate turtles, large fish and other Mosaurus, and may have been cannibalistic.

Having seen the National Treasure plaque, one might assume that there was indeed a treasure map depicted on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence.
But this is not true. The inscription is on the tomb, not on the treasure itself.
Inscribed at the base of the Declaration of Independence are the words "The first declaration of independence was written on July 4, 1776".
Although it is not known when they were written, from the beginning of their existence, large parchment sheets (approximately 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) were kept in storage.
Thus, you can see that the notation is added to the label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting led to the liberation of northern France, but not the liberation of the south.
"Vichy" France was the French section of the German right wing in 1940 and collaborated with the Resistance.

Only two weeks later, France was liberated from occupation by American troops and the Free French Forces, and they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture carried by people who can survive and interact with one another.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil or public. Civil is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen or resident. Civis is related to civitas, meaning city or town-state.
The city-state was the precursor to the nation-state.
These subcultures usually disappear, leaving behind vestiges of a history that can be considered a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states created a central government under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress's power to impose taxes was diminished, since in the absence of a national executive or courts, it relied on state authorities, usually unwilling to cooperate, to regulate its actions.
It does not have the obligation to change the taxation of the country and to transfer taxes between other countries.
The Articles were subject to ratification by the whole nation and could not be changed without the consent of the central government and usually without the presence of its representatives.
The Italy national football team and the Germany national football team are the second most successful football teams in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 auto racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the Northern Hemisphere, with international competitions and the Olympic Games following Italy in this sport.
Japan consists of over 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Since Japan consists of a group of islands, it is called an "archipelago" geographically.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when a European sailor passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began processing grain and hired Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, members of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and central coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
A large portion of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed as tourists seek to understand the origins of the earthquake.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored.
For example, the world's most common motion picture photographic format is 35 mm, and it was the dominant film size of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but the basic aspect ratio has been dropped in favor of the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35 mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
This aspect ratio format (divide by twelve to get the smallest "thousandths" ratio) is called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have the same or close to the same aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining the size of the picture.
It is said that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection that divides the image into three vertical and horizontal parts (see examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church was seen as both wealthy and powerful.
For over a thousand years Christianity had united Europe despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
His influence extended from the royal court to the common people.
The Christian principle was that wealth should be used for the relief of the suffering and the poor and that the church's treasures were for a specific purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and as the center of power and finance many questioned whether this principle had been fulfilled.
After the First World War, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, reducing a powerful military and civilian component, although the blockade was a violation of generally accepted international law codified by numerous international treaties over the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom maintained control of international waters by intercepting incoming ships, which threatened neutral shipping.
Because of the tactical question, the Germans also wanted their submarines unrestricted.

The ancient Chinese had many different ways of expressing time, all of which can be traced back to the Chinese lunar calendar or the Chinese lunisolar calendar used by dynasties.
It was among the most unstable dynasties of the divided provinces, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period that spanned 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period of uncertainty there was intense rivalry between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in Chinese history in which thousands of people died for the throne of the imperial court at Xi'an.
Its many social and political implications include the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutes to notions of community, and the emergence of a public trust in all citizens rather than government regulation.
After the revolution, many jobs were open to all able-bodied men who wanted to succeed.
Just as the military once distinguished ranks based on class, it now also distinguishes ranks based on caliber.
The French Revolution served as an example for other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very fond of meditating on spiritual matters. He used to meditate in a cave called 'Hira' on Mount "Noor" (light).
His successors, successful in their time, provided a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual nature.
Located on a hilltop south of Mecca, the isolated cave stands out from the surrounding landscape.
"No sign will be given to this people, except the sign of Jonah the prophet, which says,' If a man touches the mountain, it will be stoned. '"

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid was one of several large pyramids built to commemorate the death of a pharaoh.
In Egypt's Valley of the Tombs of the Kings are the Pyramids of the Giza Plateau or the "Giza Necropolis" (the Great Pyramid of Giza), as well as other smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramids were built to commemorate the death of the second pharaoh, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate his wives and concubines.
The upper arrow symbol resembles the letter V and the lower arrow symbol resembles staples or a square oval shape with no bottom edge.
At the top is the pointed end and the bow is pushed in, or the point is the pointed end (where the arrow is held) and the bowstring is pulled in.
The upper bow normally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is sharper and higher in pitch.
Our freedom to write, we recall, is a "symbol of our imprisonment" which was designed for poetry, and so it is usually celebrated.

In order to understand the human condition we must understand the stories that drive the events of the message.
It was a period of great turmoil known as the High Middle Ages, a European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of views within the discipline, ranging from the motivation and control of technology to a more narrow sense in which human behavior is driven by the lowest common denominator of discourse and knowledge and the use of technology.
Much of the consensus on technological possibility rests on two general ideas: that technological development is independent of cultural and political influences, and that technology can affect societies inherently without affecting socially conditioned societies.
For example, it can be said that "a motorcycle is a vehicle for the use of the road".
The way in which synaptic networks could be obtained was adapted to the type of car so that new production methods could be developed that would reduce the cost of owning a car.
We have a lot of cars and a lot of accidents on the roads, but also a lot of new techniques in medicine and tissue repair.
The Romantic movement was characterized by a deterministic element of language, derived from the writings of Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the place shaped the people, and therefore the meaning of the place was bound up with the customs and traditions of the place.
Whereas Paris was known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary era, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe in the imperial era.
Its rise to prominence began around 400 CE and lasted until 1100 CE.
This status declined in the twelfth century as merchants returned with gifts of spices that were priced higher than the prices in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fasion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early usage was heavily influenced by the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine usage.
Due to the narrowing of the communication channels, the average age of onset is between 25 and 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western European styles began to develop. One of the greatest developments of the period was the wearing of buttons, a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is a type of farming that is used to provide food for the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is the practice of growing a single crop, usually organic, in a field or farming system at a time.
Historically, subsistence farming was the most common form of agriculture, and it is still widely practiced in developing countries today.
A subculture is a group of people with a shared set of values and norms.
A subculture can be characterized by the age, culture, class, location, and gender of its members.
Language, art, religion, politics, gender, geography, or other criteria may be the defining characteristics of a subculture.
Members of a subculture typically identify with a distinct style, which encompasses a range of styles and means of expression.
One of the most common methods used to describe the severity of injuries is to determine how many cases are caused by negligence, blindness or willful blindness.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or feral children. Some feral children are confined by humans (usually their parents); others are neglected due to parental neglect or unacceptable physical or mental damage.
The victim may have been bitten or scratched before leaving or fleeing the scene.
Others were said to be eaten by wild beasts; others were said to live in solitary confinement.
While tending the pigs, the farmer observes the behavior of the pigs, such as fear or indifference to others.
If project-based learning is used to make learning easier or more enjoyable for students, then scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a separate learning path; instead, it provides support for an individual as he or she seeks a learning experience to master a new computer program or project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, where the teacher acting as a scaffold can act as an "editor" such as a small paper editor in Microsoft Office.
The virtual classroom is an internalized laboratory where software is developed to ask, answer, and explain questions to help students solve problems.
There are many reasons why children are placed in Foster Care, ranging from neglect, abuse, or extortion.
No child grows up in an environment of neglect, neglect and exploitation, but rather is nurtured.
The system and the guards were known to be a safe place for children.
The care system should provide safe housing, adequate care and good sanitation.
Foreigners had to provide the security that we lacked in a house that had been looted.
The Internet incorporates elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Other internal motivation leads to additional dimensions in terms of skills used and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Self-actualization" and "self-fulfillment" were introduced as new motivational indicators by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they considered the overall evidence of user reactions to websites.
It was the use of the video recorder that led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements now directly measured in millimeters per second.
In particular, it has been shown that if we correctly interpret microexpressions, we can know that someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his study of presidential speeches, pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still judge its sincerity.
He also suggested that even animals could be affected by human gestures, such as a trained dog.
Twentieth-century research suggests that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation and remove it from the pool of known variation.
Genetic variation is isolated and recombination occurs spontaneously between the two sets of offspring every generation.
In fact, primates have difficulty replenishing their amino acids from available plant sources due to the depletion of their digestive systems.
Failure to do so can have devastating effects; growth depression, malnutrition, and even death.
The easiest natural sources of nutrients are the proteins found in leaves and nuts. However, primates such as humans find it difficult to digest without chewing gum.
In contrast, similar animal foods (pork, beef, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also high in protein, and high in essential amino acids.
All things considered, I can't imagine your ancestor's brain would have solved the whole "protein problem" in the same way that a chimpanzee solved the common cold.
A sleep disorder is a disruption of the sleep-wake cycle during normal sleep, with a complete sleep lasting about ten to sixty minutes (10-60 minutes).
It is easy to use the Quiet Time Alarm to bring us back to consciousness without having to take a picture.
If we find ourselves "learning" time in a dream, it may be that we live on the edge of the universe, forcing our brains to experiment.
Other biorhythm choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, diuretics and salt) before bedtime, allowing the person to urinate.
The number of sexual partners a person has is directly related to the number of sexual partners a person has.
The less stressful, the more positive the experience of life. There is in every human being the potential to find a degree of ultimate satisfaction.
All good things come to those who wait, but only one thing comes to those who wait.
Tibetan Buddhism was originally Buddhist philosophy, but with the addition of Mahayana monastic life and worship, and many Indian Yoga techniques.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They are kundalini yoga, eternity, and the path of loving kindness.
With kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (burning energy) is awakened using yoga postures, compound exercises, readings and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga Deity. The practitioner visits the deity, clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and awakens enlightened consciousness.
Germany was an ally during World War II, along with the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years into the war, the two sides separated and the Cold War began.
It began more than 40 years ago and has been fought largely by proxy forces, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat back to the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, the plan was defeated within a week, when over 800,000 Soviet troops, including the Red Army, signed the Riga Security Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo ships were the easiest way to move people and goods by sea.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that our country can defend our borders indefinitely, as well as to keep our enemies at bay.
One of the most important recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States attempted to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German navy, largely equipped with U-boats, attempted to block the passage.
If the Allies were defeated, Britain would be as vulnerable to a German invasion as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats began about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Older cultures and tribes began to favor the cultivation of milk, fat, meat, and oil.
Traditionally, the goats were kept in large herds on the mountain, usually led by a boy or young man, and are still used today.
Wagonways were developed in England in the 16th century.
Although the carriages were made of parallel wooden planks, they did not protect the horses as they were pulled faster and the track was heavier than in the bad weather of the time.
The crossties shown were intended to hold the track in place, but for a long time the track was easier if there was an iron tip on top.
This was a common practice, but the heat caused the truck's wooden wheels to wear out quickly.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, all-iron railways were introduced.
Walking as a means of transportation first appeared two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (standing man).
Its ancestor, Australopithecus, no longer walked upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, while Sahelanthropus achieved bipedalism 7 trillion years ago.
We can begin to become more environmentally conscious, we can join environmental movements, we can become activists working to reduce our future suffering to some extent.
This includes symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if a temporary solution is not needed, then we must find the root of the problem and we must eliminate it.
It is clear that the world is undergoing profound changes as a result of human scientific and technological advances, compounded by problems such as overpopulation and declining human lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten design was signed by President of Congress John Hancock and his Secretary Charles Thomson and shipped several blocks to John Dunlop's printing shop.
The night spawned between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to the troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 8.
The 25 Dunlap plates whose whereabouts are known are copies of ancient documents that have survived.
Most paleontologists now believe that the only surviving group of dinosaurs alive today are birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because "they all had feathers and could fly".
There are many large birds that resemble dinosaurs.
Its legs were scaly and clawed, triangular in shape, and walked on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in use today are designed to manipulate information that is encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers have only one or two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Treatment may be delayed if toxicity occurs.Symptoms such as these three are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made.
If we want to know if someone is being poisoned, all we have to do is see if a pharmacy or a toxic household chemical store is open.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to a particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in its formal sense for this group of insects.
The origin of the term is a historical analogy with ants, the most adaptable vertebrates to parasitism in humans.
Both male and female cuckoos are brood parasites, meaning that they can survive on their own or with their mother.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 documented cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) making it the leading neurological disease in adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
It has been estimated that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
If a parent decides to abort a child it is not in the best interest of the parent, or the child.
These couples choose to make a child custody plan for themselves.
Adoption is the act of relinquishing one's parental rights to a child in favor of another person's parental rights.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method.
However, this is not the only method. In scientific research, one uses experiments to test hypotheses. Others use questioning and observation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient books, especially the Bible in Latin.
Compassion was Aristotle's approach to all of science, including psychology.
The decline of Greek knowledge cut off the source of Western Greek philosophical and scientific knowledge.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often strongly dependent on endogenous cycles and past biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, rather than responses to external periodic cues, have been observed for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue a period of free-wheeling cycles in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first demonstrations that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses to grow their DNA inside bacteria.
Two experiments attempted to detect DNA signatures in proteins by bombarding them with radioactive phosphorus or by bombarding proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material affected and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Mutations in these germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can give rise to normal or cancerous cells.

In a dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected to, and supports, a private car-based transportation system.
Today science shows that a largely carbon-based economy has made the biosphere one of the few stable environments that has driven human evolution over the past two million years.
All social actors use the peer-to-peer system to protest against both individuals and the peer-to-peer system.
In developing countries it is common to hear protests over poor water quality or broken bridges.
Why is the transportation system so complex, why does it fail so often, are the transportation engineers so incompetent, or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the behavior of passengers and vehicles between two points that interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study large ice streams because the movement of icebergs cannot be approximately one hundred percent certain.
Fortunately, these movements and driving patterns are usually constant; therefore, the amount of traffic flow is usually constant and can be roughly calculated mathematically.
To better describe the flow of traffic, a relationship has been established between three key properties: 1. direction 2. frequency 3. velocity.
These relationships are useful in the planning, design, and implementation of road facilities.
Small mammals were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly made it easier to separate from predators and easier to find food and more useful mates.

Humans have known about the basic chemical elements gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their native forms and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of one or a combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These four elements are (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although the theory also states that they transform into new substances to form observable matter.
A basic alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are also metals, as are other metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also be made with fewer non-metallic elements, such as carbon.

The principle of a fission bomb is that energy is required to fuse a nucleus of an atom with many protons or neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, crushing the nucleus and releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei; if the nuclei are disturbed, they can easily break apart.
The lunar surface is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers wide and 100 kilometers deep.
It is narrower below the maria and wider below the plateau.

Content theory focuses on why people are moving or interested in what they see.
This theory suggests that individuals have needs and/or wants that will persist into adulthood.
These theories explain what causes some people to do what they want and what factors in the environment cause people to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Typically, there are two ways in which managers lead their subordinates. One of them is usually to retain a subordinate.
If you show favoritism, you may find it hard to make decisions that are in harmony with your beliefs, to discipline your children, to check up on them, to give them responsibilities, or to hold them accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything his or her team and owners have done.
However, leaders are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of their teams.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leader and other team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with a few differences.
Virtual team members often function as "points of contact" for their immediate physical group.
This allows teams to self-manage better than conventional teams because different time zones can be used to meet other members.
The physical presence of "invisible teams" (Larson and La Castleo 1989, P109) is a unique component of virtual teams.
An "invisible team" is a management team that is accountable to its members.
Why does the organization want to be a learning and process-oriented organization?
When available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can occur.
Consequently, these organizational processes work together to overcome barriers that prevent new innovative processes from serving customer needs.

The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
As these new technologies have advanced, it has become possible to see and examine structures and processes in the brain that we cannot normally see.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the inner processes of our minds.
Despite the strong connotations of AI from science fiction, AI forms a very fundamental branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
Research in artificial intelligence is how machines perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, including fingerprint, voice and facial recognition.
It separates science from science, and its content is obviously the solution to the complexity of life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military as they have been built into many home computers and video game application software.
A field trip is a form of schooling in which a teacher takes a group of students to an area where there is no bus service.
It provides technological solutions with virtual field trips where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing virtual field trips is a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with classmates later.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol. The website is updated annually, but the original site is still online and made up of clippings.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. While students often start blogs about their experiences with arbitrary grammar and spelling, the presence of a general blog audience can help.
Since students are the most critical readers, bloggers began to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "encourages students to become more aware of their surroundings". It is important to note that the audience inspires students to be creative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to expand their distance learning beyond the traditional school day.
The goal of using blogs is to "make learning more analytical and critical"; through active responses to Internet content, students can interpret their own position in the context of others' opinions and express their own perspectives on certain issues (ORAVEC, 2002).
