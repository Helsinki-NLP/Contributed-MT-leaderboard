UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only worsen the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet this month with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions within the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation unresolvable".
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they had shown when they succeeded in reaching an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thereby addressing the crisis in Syria.
Eight poll numbers that show Donald Trump has a real shot.
Some have tried to label him a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump leading by double-digit percentages, and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it's still early days.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead gave way to Herman Cain in the polls, but neither won a state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why he would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group the Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's power and starting to support him with money.
Here are some numbers from recent surveys that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a fluke:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the figure had climbed to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
These figures hold.
A Quinnipiac poll last week in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "thrilled" if Trump won the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "angry" if front-runner Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as an issue.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted Monday.
We see the same numbers in Iowa, where 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
However, 44% believe he lacks the personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament has no place in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the intellectual stance, Republican voters think Trump is authentic.
According to a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, when asked who was most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump.
That's a far cry from late July, when four in 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: in the past, GOP voters haven't been very good at reading the future.
At the same time in the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, versus only 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
But these numbers show that a majority of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans have retreated to another candidate, Trump is still leading them all.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will split into more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September found that in the hypothetical scenario of Trump working with most of the other Republican candidates, Trump would almost always have majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush, and finally 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich, and Chris Christie.
He's neck and neck with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one matchup.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of Trump voters say they won't change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they are open to changing their mind.
However, Trump's most prominent opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he is twice as likely as voters who say they have decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign kickoff speech two months ago, immigration has been a central issue in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will drive a wedge between key Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
But according to an ABC/Post poll released Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with authority reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
According to an ABC/Post poll released Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, with 54% saying they are "dissatisfied" and 21% "very nervous".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the PMQs has been long-awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his Prime Minister's Questions debut, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of his six questions shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly appearances, he called for "less theater and more facts".
He also stated that he might give up some of his holdings and give them to his colleagues.
The showdown will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he appointed a "shadow cabinet" and delivered a speech to the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from some Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "respectfully remained silent" and acknowledged the "heroism of the RAF in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around a dozen ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leadership team, citing differences of opinion over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are "piling up" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his stance on the European Union and the benefits cap.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour would bring in changes that would remove the idea of capping altogether.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said the party was "very clear" in its exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the gallery in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from outside sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said the PMQs were too confrontational and that he would refrain from retorts and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has stated that Angela Eagle, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to discuss the matter.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the 'Punch and Judy' style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had not succeeded in doing so.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, the way he or she leads the Chamber of Deputies, and his or her standing among fellow parliamentarians, although critics say it has become a caricature and is in need of deep reform.
'Square in Joburg': Homeless youth benefit from photography lessons
It's tough being a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who grew up on the streets have found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of their neighborhoods and make money from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill says that an increase in the UK minimum wage could mean "greater spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh higher labour costs within the company, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis should be commended, not criticized, for his conduct.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral damage in the storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger half of the talented duo often referred to as the "Special Ks", was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios's scandalous skid against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a grueling qualifying match played shortly thereafter in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios down, and I should have put this kid down".
Although last seen taking a powder after suffering muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn into the conflict a little bit", Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a racket when he lost because he got cramps in the U.S., but he's not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of that.
But in all seriousness, he's handled himself extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and he's integrated into the team, he hasn't had any kind of conflict with the other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in excellent shape, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on his strengths and weaknesses.
Healy also supported the decision to disqualify Kyrgios for the all-important tie, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the best fit for all, but supported the Canberra native's long-term return to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the tie game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has come up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs some time away from the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for the team and good for him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
With at least five months to go before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've made up their minds about which candidate to support.
But Clinton supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percentage points.
Clinton maintains her lead among women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
Support among men has dropped significantly and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still ahead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digit percentage points among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were chosen to run on the party's ticket.
A quarter would support her somewhat reluctantly and another 15% would support her just because she represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters are enthusiastic about her election is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about the front-runner, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton supporters are asked an open-ended question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
With the vice president considering a possible run for president, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he should not run.
When asked about their second choice for the party's nominee, Democratic voters overwhelmingly name Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate most likely to win the general election; that's down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second but the percentage who say he's the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important about an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues over electability.
Just like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates do well on a few key characteristics relative to their party's primary voters.
A majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be people of integrity and trustworthiness and to have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of the three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say the same of Sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters also generally consider the three, Clinton, Sanders, and Biden, to have the same ideologies as them.
On all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject and say it hasn't affected their overall opinion of the candidate.
But it's a different story with the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on the subject in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say it has changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they've changed their opinion of Clinton in a negative way.
While Democratic voters consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, this continues to raise concerns among voters overall: only 32% consider her honest and trustworthy, down 8% from last month and 15% from May.
62% of voters do not consider her to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have carte blanche for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of people who think Sanders has integrity is higher than the number of people who think he doesn't, but like Carson, a lot of people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity brothers indicted for the murder of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, strapped to the back of a 30-pound backpack filled with sand, and repeatedly pushed as he tried to walk to a target on icy terrain.
Mr. Deng complained of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after he collapsed and claim they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national chairman of the fraternity, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members began hiding their personal assets and basically put the good of the fraternity before the good of Michael Deng", Wagner said.
He couldn't be revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated injuries to his head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the fraternity rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals", Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer for Deng's family, said in a statement.
The fraternities and their members need to be held accountable, and this action by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury has recommended that the first five members be charged with murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault and accessory to murder.
"We want to hold accountable not only the individuals involved but if there is an organization that has authorized the Brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is when it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few clues as to the time frame.
After the first interest rate increase, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor of how the economy and financial assets responded.
That's why Fed officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should focus not on when interest rates start to rise but on the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at play.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all the hype about interest rate increases has been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of cheap money", Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But that's not to say there won't be effects.
Here's how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate hike may make things volatile for a while.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for returns to capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, perhaps again reflecting the lag in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after Fed hikes.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by about 14 percent - moving towards rising interest rates, fairly unchanged in the 250-day period afterwards (average rise of 2.6 percent) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron's by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche stated that the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate cycle and the benefits start to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic low point for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice was nominal GDP below 4,5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question "whether this time is different", Deutsche said.
Market participants have been preparing all year for a Fed rate hike decision, with all eyes on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate hike at this meeting, forward trading indicates a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all cycles of interest rate increases to date have been in a profit growth supercycle, with GDP eclipsing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began", the report stated.
On the contrary, it was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession of the period considered.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and counting.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for equities when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first rise/fall in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, bond yields fall immediately,' Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that these interest rate increases will cause short-term and long-term bond yields to converge, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, though "we're still cautious about pushing yield", Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adjusted to expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the projected decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is straighter, the average credit spread has widened and volatility has increased -- all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Overall, US-based companies will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Heavily indebted multinationals will suffer because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate hike", the Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with both high returns on equity and low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality peers by an average of 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.
Debt will become a major issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the rise in the dollar.
Savers could also benefit, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for "goofing off"
It claims to be increasingly similar to its commercial rival
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits
Fellow comedian Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, claiming the show isn't original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a senior MP has said, putting pressure on the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public broadcaster was "dumbing down" and looking more and more like its commercial rival.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 is 'going nuts' - although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it is turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples I can think of that are just copying what's already out there", said Mr Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC denied the allegations, stating that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out about classical music anywhere that I'm not gonna find out about it on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivaled.
"In addition, I think it's also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and putting out new tracks", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said that he had to work harder to attract audiences than in the past because of the British public's lesser knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC brand criticised at the Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22 million.
Do you understand why there's often talk about that show being unoriginal and unremarkable?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - be done "in a BBC way".
He added that he wishes the Corporation would "find the golden goose in their own backyard" the next time they launch an entertainment show.
However, he refused to prohibit future takeovers of new seasons of The Voice or spending licensing money on other forms of entertainment.
Online sales saw their smallest increase ever in August, and it could be Black Friday.
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
Last month saw the slowest growth since 2000 so far.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could cause a reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, specialists say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the smallest increase since 2000 so far, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Specialists say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures showing a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go all the way back to 2000, there's always been a tendency to rationalize over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor at sales index IMRG, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so in various circumstances, such as from their couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little bit, you might see a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
According to experts, shoppers would refrain from making purchases before the event on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crowded in front of their computers to get their hands on deals, causing the websites of several retailers to crash.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers fought for bargains, may have contributed to this reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 in every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made through online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than in high street fashion stores.
After sanctioning Bin Laden's family, Muslims bury victims of crane collapse in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were paraded through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The health minister said a total of 394 people were injured in the crane collapse.
In the walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Dressed in white, mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy site, where just a few days ago a construction crane crashed through the roof of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In a street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of a crane collapse at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Among the victims was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the crash.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide that detail but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have come ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet commented on the crane collapse and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for comment.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and has undertaken major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son, disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in heavy wind and rain, just days before millions of people are expected to arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, an essential once-in-a-lifetime journey for every able-bodied Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased victims will receive one million Saudi riyals (£174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting credits into Swiss francs
Two offers for the conversion of Swiss franc loans into lei have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the absence of currency risk and lower rates.
The downside may come a few years down the road, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting Volksbank's loans into francs and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers a three-year fixed interest rate in lei of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Bancă Transilvania's conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in RON due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the amount of risk and administration fees paid by the client, then an additional 22,5% reduction was applied to the RON balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to what they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42,5% and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of converting CHF loans into lei is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected against future increases in the franc and the loan will be repaid in the currency of his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no revaluation of the property, no additional collateral and no further proof of income is required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and no additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to what customers were paying before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
The risks
The problem is that the first few years are mostly interest, and the customer pays very little in principal.
Bancpost's offer of very low interest for the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
However, it is not known how this interest rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3,25%, so overall the cost reduction is also lower.
A possible risk for all RON floating rate loans is that ROBOR will increase significantly in the coming years (more than Libor - CHF).
For example, the three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009 it was over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer, may arise.
It 's time for interest rate decisions for the US Federal Reserve .
The world's eyes are on the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of those who thought the decision would be made last week now believe it will be for a while and that interest rates will remain in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon zero rates and begin a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, a senior analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars onto the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less rosy global picture.
He warned markets to brace for a rise but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday at 20:00 CET.
Celebrities Who Lost Their Glamour
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), have been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also rumored to have struggled with drug abuse and in 2008 was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly comes at a cost.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is sidelined for several months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the tear-jerker that will keep him sidelined for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred following a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had broken through PSV's defence.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, struggles, then plays fantastically and now this happens.
In the locker room, they put the oxygen mask on him.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but with a double fracture the rest is six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It looks like Moreno got lucky and avoided the red card and a penalty kick.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourselves when I say it's foul and a red card.
It was a very nasty two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for your messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I start the road to recovery, I will come back stronger".
In related news, Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw injury in defeat to PSV.
The England defender has one more reason to recover in order to play in the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury".
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't mean to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good", Cocu said.
I didn't see that.
All I could see was the ball going the other way, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the action on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel really bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but he's still holding strong.
Winning against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tall order, but after seeing England's squad for the tournament, I'm not counting on a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the Tests.
I wouldn't rule out an away win either.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but they have good spinners on their batting line and their morale is high; they will not be scarred by the events of 2012 but will have a positive, youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali is evolving as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though unknown at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it's difficult for me to analyse the decision not to select Adam Lyth for the team.
He played his seven Test matches against two good forwards, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I've said this before - the players are their own selectors.
Some fifty years and Lyth may have prolonged his run but his destiny lies in his own hands.
I hope if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he'll get other opportunities.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when his performance was not up to his ability, and I'm not surprised; above all, he's a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes for a batsman to get noticed in Test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and away.
The only complaint you can have is that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was at his best - but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Joining the team is Alex Hales, a batsman I rate very highly.
He's an X-factor cricketer who we spotted early on for Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us on a pitch at Trent Bridge.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors but this will of course depend on the make-up of the UAE team.
The idea has been floated for Moeen to open the batting alongside Cook, which would take the extra spinner while retaining four quicks, and I'm fine with that.
I don't see why a pitcher can't hit there and this southpaw's already proven he's a hell of a hitter.
Moeen may not have brought success to his home county of Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, so the gap isn't that big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as a first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is joining the team as a back-up spinner and although I have had limited contact with him, I have been struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age -- 31 batting average, 35 home runs -- and think he's a punt returner, but there aren't a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England have also made a few changes to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a Test match consultant could be a coup.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, having played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker room, even if they're delivering messages that have been delivered before, can bring a breath of fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's team mate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not make the schedule.
And you have to remember, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
These decisions are never taken lightly.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy holds steady until 2017
With each passing day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more muddled, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the other day that - mired in crises similar to the one in the EU - not all of them internally provoked - some member states are fuelled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at their annual meeting, the TUC decided that they didn't want this either if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie diary.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that a number of obtuse ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the ultra-cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before she falters like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to believe that this will help the English posers, whose energy would be better spent trying to prevent Scotland from breaking away from the UK - something they don't want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up Brexit, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know first-hand how acquisitive Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons are who view the EU with scepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum which ratified our 1973 entry by a 2:1 margin.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who became famous in the early 1990s when he was Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of tax-evading crooks, foreigners committing wire fraud and pseudo non-doms who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same way, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in her opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a principled concession to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him not to waste his time with me -- seems in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC he vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would indulgently call evolutionary.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most people who disagree with the Tories' "anglicism" might agree with that.
That's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week, when the scholar in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's phrase - does not correspond with what McDonnell said nor with what JC told colleagues and MPs in the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey -- remember, he sensitized me, too -- message discipline remains important in the age of television and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass in Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell has claimed.
Simon Jenkins certainly seems to think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic sophistry about EU membership - consistent with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophistry - Tom Watson is adamant that the JC will not campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters there - on concessions to Britain when it could all be for naught?
The U.S. is already disappointed enough about the British military's poor performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts are critical of Public Health England's decision on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
Some researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
A paper published last month in the Lancet medical journal attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in BMJ questioned the claims and their foundation "on solid ground or shifting sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said they expected PHE's claims that "current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to summarise their views on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting have been summarised in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell or stated that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding in the past from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared funding received from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not funding reportedly received from the cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but they include some known 'leaders' in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of whom even declare industry funding in their paper.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's Head of Tobacco Control.
The group's research "convincingly masks" the lack of "strong evidence of harm for most products across most criteria", McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health policy at PHE, says the BMJ's claims have been challenged in the past.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking".
One out of every two lifetime smokers loses his or her life to the habit.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively low, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information that is and is not supported by evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about relative harms compared to tobacco.
Each year, around 80,000 people lose their lives to a smoking-related illness and the annual cost to the national health system from smoking is £2 billion.
By clearly articulating the current evidence - that while e-cigarette use is not risk-free, it poses only a fraction of the harm of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Ads that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
The dreaded killer drones!
Iron for breaking your ankles!
The cluster bombs!
And electric batons that cause excruciating pain without leaving a mark!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fiery charade, staged by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities' willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus and subway stations that need a second look.
"Important announcement, are you travelling on the DLR between 15 and 18 September?" reads one of the ads, using London Underground fonts and branding, with the DLR line morphing into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will swarm the DLR customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of Allen keys that they claim "provide access to about a third of the world's bus station advertising space".
Transport for London is not amused by this vandalism in the form of flyers.
One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists are turning to working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greeting commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty film had over 100,000 views on Facebook within 24 hours and was created by ad agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and voiceover artist also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was shocked by the silence surrounding the ad for the arms fair - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with making a more realistic ad but "enriching it with animations and strong colors, it was more striking".
'They did a great job helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,' says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would require the authorities in the UK to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to your door.
Perhaps the most creative arms fair art form comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the US Army for "AT4CS RS with shoulder mounted launcher".
It includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pretty.
Eight golden rules for living in the dorm

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not salesmen.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of an unusual project, quite "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being unavoidable.
Both performances, held on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience another way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at that time, the only classical music ensemble without a conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It's true, on the one hand musicians need an education to become either soloists or performers in an orchestra -- I'm talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "skilled workers".
They themselves feel they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so the business, the music business, is marketing itself.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if you look at this world, you have a skilled workforce, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen but has to watch, which is stupid".
The violinist attributes this change in his playing to the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my mid-30s, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So I found no sense in continuing on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at that time nobody did this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How can you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who make up the orchestra depend on the success of this project for a living.
In the 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiously, the more complex the repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", says Grimal, adding that at Sunday's performance "there were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very courageous" one, precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present and play 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition like the Enescu Festival, there is room and interest for something different, something that breaks down barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the profession of musician, as it is organized today, has a smell of death" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
In Bach's time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, they are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it has no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To get into the EU you had to pass sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as they are in France.
It's the same with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes that may not be pretty, but when you cut them, they're real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to center stage and that the institutions and industries that run this system understand that music doesn't need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and that can be done starting with education policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its teaching in schools, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products", believes Grimal.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, it's very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier, it has to be one way, if we want to train a musician, it's completely different.
In your opinion, which is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asks the smiling French artist.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from transcending this "soldier" status, transcending what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain point that they are not soldiers, and that is why they leave smiling after the concert".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a public discussion organized within the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.
Profile by David Grimal
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, during which he has regularly given concerts in the last 20 years on the main classical music stages of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the Orchestre National de Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Berliner Symphoniker, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestre de l'Opera de Lyon, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Sinfonia Warsaw, under conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schᅢnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fru<unk>hbeck de Burgos and Peter Evosot, Andris Nelsons,

In addition to his career as a solo artist, David Grimal was keen to explore more personal projects.
The freedom provided by his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts for and with the homeless at the Saint-Leu church in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Residence at the Dijon Opera.
He taught violin at the Musikhochschule in Saarbrücken, Germany.
He also gives many master classes and was a member of the jury of the Long-Thibaud International Competition in Paris in 2010.
She was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal played on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" of 1710, but also on the "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year's George Enescu International Festival with Orchestra Les Dissonances, featuring Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances took the stage again on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed by Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for Little Big Voices.
Cinema City launches the ultimate challenge for kids: dubbing two characters from the blockbuster "Snow Queen 3D"
You have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give her a chance to be a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign for enthusiastic and ambitious children between the ages of 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", offering them the extraordinary opportunity to voice two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic cartoons the emphasis was on the actor's voice being close to the specificity of the animated character, in the last period, when creating the story, those who are going to interpret the voices are also taken into account, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice, and we're challenging parents to enter their kids in our contest.
They're going to have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors", said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between 11 September and 30 September, Cinema City organises a pre-selection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio alongside professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where they can register their child for the contest and prepare them for the voice test.
Afterwards, they have to choose one of the four videos available on the platform, download the texts that the child will read and then, the child will record himself performing his own dubbed version.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants for the challenge: "Yellow Feather 3D", "Moon: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Koala 3D" and "Maya Bee 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will dub a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Crăiasa Zăpezii 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, lowering fiscal 2016 projections
FedEx reported disappointing results for the latest quarter, with the delivery giant cutting its full-year profit estimates due to low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
Around the same time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company's shares fell about 2.5% in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less than a previous estimate.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The decreasing estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, effective from 4 January, and higher surcharges for inland transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company stated that it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and the development of e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that 'the firm is facing a considerably weaker than expected economic situation, particularly with respect to global production and trade.'
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it planned to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of hires it made last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research poll.
Profit increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnating revenues from its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted FedEx Ground's bottom line.
In the last quarter, ground division revenues increased by 29% but operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express division saw an increase in revenue due to higher base rates, while the freight division saw a decrease in revenue due to rising costs.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares had fallen $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
By Tuesday's close, they were down 11% year-on-year and 17% from their record high on June 11.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank's meeting room, a mural of the United States will loom.
The map is meant as a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Federal Reserve was given a dual task by Congress: to maximize employment in the US and to maintain price stability.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third burden could be the X factor in a hard-to-predict decision that will be announced on Tuesday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to be unburdened by the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate that has been in place since late 2008.
Even if most data point to a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials from adding to the volatility by raising the federal funds rate - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation are going to be the first and foremost things they're going to look at", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
'But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them reason to wait,' she said.
There is no consensus on what decision the Fed will take, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg anticipated an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets are expecting the Fed to delay, with a key indicator showing the probability of an increase at just 30%.
This would indicate a stock market decline if the Fed raises interest rates, unless policymakers soften the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep interest rates steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise interest rates at this time", Lonski said.
If Fed policymakers were to do so, "they would have to act profoundly in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets".
Other experts said that an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise rates by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers total employment.
Wage earnings showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continued to fall short of the central bank's annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of plummeting oil prices.
The economy "can and needs higher rates given the tight labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to go into a tailspin later that month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16% below its record high reached in May as investors feared that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has retreated somewhat this month, with the Dow now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the timing of interest rate increases.
"Without what's happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer in the meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact is going to be on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on after the events in China", Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed's major interests, so it should practically not be factored into its decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
The mere hint by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion sent shockwaves through global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "The Fed has a history of overreacting to changes in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the decision-making body that supported the rate hike, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis affecting Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite implications with limited identifiability for US growth", Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those declines.
The Fed should only put the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turmoil is nowhere near that level, he said.
"We certainly don't want to get into a situation where we fear an interest rate hike because markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until something changes in that regard, I don't think they should take premature action.
Looking for a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a general store offering a dazzling array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's also an auto department where you need to buy some motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes at least an hour to walk through all the aisles.
If you get hungry from all that shopping, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food court (good, affordable) is close to homes and offers several takeaway options.
Do you need anything -- anything -- Thai?
Probably find you at LAX-C.
Products are reasonably priced and certain items are sold wholesale.
Fresh produce includes herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai produce.
The meat department is large, as is the fish department - the serving staff will clean and fillet your fish and even fry it for you if you like.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer section, where you will find frozen curry leaves, melon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish balls, traditional, semi-prepared sausages and much more.
Who buys there: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The discovery: fresh durian fruit right next to the housing area.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area shared with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Seven's Sunrise is dominating the polls, despite attempts by Channel Nine to broadcast the party leadership change on the Today Show.
The urgent trip of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the Liberal leadership changes did not bring a significant increase in Today's audience.
Channel Nine's morning show broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
Rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was picked up in London as part of a multi-week series that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruelty" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase from Monday's audience of 317,000 and last Tuesday's audience of 283,000, but the numbers were lower than last Thursday's audience of 343,000.
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise for the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, it is not just Parliament that is affected by the tide of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The headline news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics questioned whether Thomson was capable of handling a show on his own, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The ratings for last night answered with a resounding "yes".
Seven's X Factor maintained its position with 1.136 million viewers, slightly ahead of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven experienced ups and downs on the second night of airing The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5 to 5:30 p.m.) of the new general knowledge show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Chase Australia's second-night ratings drop will give tacit confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, the show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
For openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts diminished.
4 killed after police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into crowds demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Dhakal alleged that the police used tear gas and then fired in the air before using rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest development after weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern region, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution but a hugely contentious issue in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake killed thousands in April.
In Kathmandu this week, lawmakers voted on provisions of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange views with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with guns.
'It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s,' said Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister also said that all the facts and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and determined at the CSAT meeting on Thursday". concluded the Prime Minister.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low pressure front about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of forming into a tropical cyclone within the next two days, the Miami forecaster added.
Weight-loss surgery may be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight-loss surgery than those who undergo nonsurgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of people who received nonsurgical treatments for diabetes remained almost the same at 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured in 36 percent and partially cured in 28 percent.
In the medical group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1 percent and partially cured in only 2 percent of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgery group", the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal hemoglobin A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
But in the medical group, it stayed at about eight percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce five-year mortality, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes associated with the two types of surgery.
At five years, compared with the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and were more likely to have complete remission from diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of obese people in Sweden that surgery extends life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic outlook for people with BMIs under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this paper is critical, because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we're waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take in all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued an appeal for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even each continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but we also need to think about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved these problems", he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, stating that the violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush and asked him to resolve this issue without violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and it had unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children ingesting hand sanitizer in the past 4 years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, U.S. poison control centers have reported a roughly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol hand sanitizer.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, reports of children under 12 ingesting hand sanitizer increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Lopez stated that some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social media.
On YouTube, you can watch videos of teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
Apparently, the teens mixed the mouthwash with alcohol to make a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think it's hurting them", says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types are scented.
Strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers are the most appealing to children.
The hand sanitizer contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand sanitizers in accessible places, and if kids can get to them, that's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, ended up in the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is legally considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was stuttering and unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head from the alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or wet wipes and to keep hand sanitizer out of children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York plotted to poison their "evil" teacher by "putting antibacterial products in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and has banned it from her classroom.
The police considered the plan "insignificant" and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of the Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now an Ajax ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer broadcast Celtic match summaries; why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there.
This isn't just about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's where the interest is.
Tension is high in Old Firm matches and it's not just the Scots who want to watch these games.
I will change the situation, promises Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic are struggling but the Norwegian boss has promised to turn things around.
The defeat to Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by defeat to 10-man Aberdeen, now top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and they will bounce back".
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we need to go further.
We absolutely need the support of Celtic because that's how players get better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's caution about January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting he had identified several targets for the January transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect Ibrox's unity.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different to the summer one".
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more damage bringing in players you don't need.
Celtic target Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old struggled for two years with ankle problems and was unable to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clash with the SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was then cancelled - his third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson stands by his statements, insisting, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance".
The Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
The undefeated Hibee has been taken to task after admitting he sang a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle.
"It was the derby and it was the excitement of the moment", said the striker, adding: "Needless to say I'm not coming back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic".
Tannadice Council has confidence in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still trust the management team to turn things around - but agrees that the decline on the pitch needs to end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're going to get the guys back in shape", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for the "dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen desperately need to hang on to the Hamilton Accies to secure a seventh successive league win, which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's no team that's won anything, cup or league, that hasn't won games like that".
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it increases
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in July, while the number of unemployed in Britain as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's 5.9% unemployment rate was higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74,0% - a figure above the UK average of 73,5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The authorities' long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate rising and the unemployment rate falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, barring some belated legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will sit in an observation room in the execution chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws near, I dread the thought.
So, why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It's true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because applications usually outnumber available seats, there's a gruesome lottery to decide who gets chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for members of the press from 12 to five.
Those chosen will view the execution with impartiality.
I can not do that.
I'd be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I'd developed my own bond with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way they want it told, get access.
I complained to her.
He acknowledged that he "could have worded it better", but he still thinks they're wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't if you asked me.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants there to be an international report on the subject.
He thinks if he dies, the publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be joining me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files I made.
I won't go into all the details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I will watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For that, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll learn what it's like to watch a man you love die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and is threatening to pull out of the race.
Peter Moody claimed that Victoria Racing's stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from racing.
He launched an attack on the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, stating that they are waging a personal campaign against him, the final straw being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on race day.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing industry and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidari's positive cobalt test result, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words regarding the statements about spies and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I was silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that it all comes out at once", Moody said.
It is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to walk with my head held high, and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm doing my best for them.
The moment they start to think that's not the case, I have to quit coaching.
At that point I'll have to figure out what to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I will say if asked - and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there", Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current chief executive officer CEO of RVL, knew then and they know now.
Am I supposed to think this is personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a backbone and be able to hold people outside the trainers accountable for what happens in the industry?
Am I a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry that bad?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
They may have to take away my license and put me away, and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now may cause them to consider that option.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and I'll get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew with the lengthy investigation into cobalt testing that Lidari was involved in and his elimination prompted him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice was applied to the horses' legs, which violates the rules.
He's breaking the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this", he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on her leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It was the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race-day treatment of applying a poultice, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
This is a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand the need for rules but this has gone too far", said Moody.
The hit-and-run driver in Cobram has been arrested
Police have arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and a hit and run.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man turned himself in to Shepparton Police.
It looks like he's going to be charged with leaving the scene of an accident, failing to render first aid and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticisms of his team's tackling tactics "distorted topics" brought up by the NRL's top two seeds.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson stated that the umpires allowed Storm players to "slam" the team in Storm's nervous win in Friday night's qualifying final in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a mild reference to the Storm after his team's win over the North Queensland Cowboys in Saturday night's qualifier, when he called the match a "demonstration" of rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to the defense of his team's tackling tactics and stated that the players were simply focusing on "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two prominent coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would beat them.
"And it doesn't stop there - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, except that in the last six weeks we've really focused on contact tackling and that's how we've changed things.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how that always happens this time of year.
Bellamy disputed Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 championship playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his point by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was", Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George's got a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a damn.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be thrilling football, mainly because of the fast young midfielders.
That's the kind of play you want to make when you have players like that.
He made this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're kind of worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm-Roosters game was more of a scoring contest than the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two tries left, that means thrilling game?
Or does exciting mean taking breaks and not scoring?
They're plans to me.
If they're talking about us, it means we might run into them at some point.
The Storm have the weekend off as they have earned the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at home in next Saturday's preliminary final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg was using the girls' phones to lure pedophiles into sending him pictures.
A pedophile was using an 11-year-old girl's phone to request images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping then logged onto an online messaging service where another user sent him a series of indecent images featuring children.
The girl subsequently woke up and noticed the phone was missing, which she found in Hogg's hand while he slept.
She looked at her phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, police viewed the five pictures then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" Internet searches using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "lure pedophiles" onto the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Magistrates' Court: "He has stated that it is an addiction - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the images and about asking that person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he couldn't think clearly when he drank and that he wished he could see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used his computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
On 14 June last year, 23-year-old Hogg, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making or taking indecent photographs of child subjects, and violated the terms of his parole on 25 January this year and failed to appear at his court appearance on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be registered on the sex offenders register because it could be argued that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed sentencing until October, citing social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in that case but remained in custody pending appearances in other cases.
He was put on the sex offenders' register before he was sentenced.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, Africa's longest-serving leader, fell down the steps of a podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats threatening them not to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent from a hidden number but it is titled 'death'", he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
They shall warn the Members concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and that once they have left Parliament, parliamentary immunity shall no longer apply.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is going to lay off 30,000 people.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the services sector.
This year, HP will go public and split into two companies, separating its PC and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected layoffs will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
'These restructurings will provide the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with a more competitive and cost sustainable structure,' said Meg Whitman, HP's president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
'Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to the new way of doing business,' Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and "focus on providing unrivaled integrated solutions" to businesses.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called the "cradle of Silicon Valley" is spun off.
HP went through a massive reorganization to accommodate the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in a long line of moves based on the idea that firms that focus their attention more in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching a 15-year high.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the sufferer is surrounded by enough "healthy mood" friends, his chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who aren't depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends cuts the likelihood of developing a mental disorder in half.
Of course, for friendship to be effective, it must first be available.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style over substance, the immediacy of response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled down on the need to create the appearance of a strong, fun-loving, successful personality, even when in reality it's isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- which affects our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really does not buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it brought attention to this idea.
Characters were not defined by their job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, their moments of watching football in their comfy armchairs, and Ross' passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can relate to this situation, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me, "My role in listening to suicidal and depressed people showed me how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference".
Often, people who come to us don't feel able to talk to their friends.
The old adage of going it alone is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as weak if you talk openly about your problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term psychological coping mechanisms.
The show highlighted the small moments of male friendship.
As much as objective, out-of-the-box intervention over the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with a full set replay to celebrate, why not invite your friends over for coffee at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is airing on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG win against Swedish side Malmo.
Coming up next, we'll have a look at the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job, with Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group stage with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo in Tuesday's match at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut for PSG, putting the French champions ahead despite missing a number of opportunities before securing the lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Coming into Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as the French side's goal is not only to qualify for the knockout stages but also to improve on their progress to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's pupils were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the opportunity to score after being replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his illustrious career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable gap to the next ranked teams, even if there are still aspects that we have to improve throughout the season", Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I'm sorry we didn't manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury to make one of three substitutions for the Parisian side in a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentinian attacking midfielder was named the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe and he demonstrated this when he sprinted to Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defence before shooting incredibly over Johan Wiland in the far right corner.
But if anyone was expecting PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine international caps, a five-man defence and two defensive midfielders, were a strong opponent.
But their offense wasn't impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot past Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG's players slowed down a few times, giving some unnecessary passes and not completing interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani just after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved more adept at supporting his teammates, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a deflected shot by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's cross.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb long-range save by Wiland for David Luiz kept the final score before newcomer Ezequiel Lavezzi was disallowed a goal in extra time.
Malmo's Norwegian coach Age Hareide later stated that PSG were a class above and that "The last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year".
Since then, I've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played a great game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from share sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodities exchange, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.
Having lost 57% of its market value this year, the company is grappling with plummeting commodity prices as China's economic slowdown affects demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The pre-emption right increased Glencore's share price on the London Stock Exchange in trading on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose by 2,77% to 131,60 shillings on the FTSE 100, which opened 0,69% higher.
Glencore disclosed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, down 2.4% from Tuesday's closing price.
It pulled 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the prolonged stagnant growth of the Chinese economy led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges greater expansion of the world economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reform that the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening-up policies", Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening-up and encouraging reform will bring new impetus and vitality and make way for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital, and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the Declaration, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
According to the declaration, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and providing greater market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
According to the declaration, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up the state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened to private investment.
'The State authorities will not change their policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-invested enterprises and provide them with better services,' according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or 'green cards', streamlining requirements and the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right to practise of lawyers and educating judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
Education unions, unhappy with the government's proposal to raise wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and education union leaders came to nothing, with the government proposing a 10% wage increase from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanting a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The government's proposal today didn't satisfy us, otherwise we wouldn't be in the situation to convene the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than we expected.
"Actually, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016", said Anton Hadar, the president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, a meeting of the FSLI will be held, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations in the country the proposal for salary increase, and the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told the trade unionists that the government is trying to send the wage bill as quickly as possible to Parliament so that it can come into force on December 1.
The bill provides for a 25% increase in education salaries out of a total increase of 70%, to be phased in over the next four years.
Also, Victor Ponta has promised the trade unionists the full payment of court sentences for 2016.
The migrant crisis: tragedy in the Aegean
At least 22 migrants drowned Tuesday in Turkish territorial waters after their boat capsized.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, AFP reports, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea, heading for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had rescued 249 people from the sinking boat, but their nationalities were not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two more people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than it could carry, so it sank.
The route has recently become a popular one for migrants fleeing war and hardship in countries such as Syria and Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India is laying off about 130 flight attendants for being overweight, the company announced late last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist", reports The Washington Post.
The mass firing is the latest in a decade-long battle between the company and overweight flight attendants.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s when Air India started using charts with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India dismissed nine flight attendants who were considered 'exceptionally overweight' as this 'may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility needed to perform emergency measures'.
The flight attendants sued the company, won, and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to get them to lose weight have failed", a company spokesman explained at the time.
A football player from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali:
A Star player is giving Gigi Becali lessons on how to promote young players.
If the sponsor of the championship decided to close the football Academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, the defender Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" academy will operate in the town of Dej, local kids are expected to a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy to have reached this stage of launching the football academy that bears my name.
For me, it's extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without worrying about money for training.
They must have only one concern: that of playing football as well as possible.
The technical details shouldn't be their concern.
They need to showcase their talent.
That's what the Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I'm waiting for the mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he's with them", football player Papp told dejeanul.ro.
Star quarterback academy accepts children up to the age of 11.
The whole party wants to govern.
The interim president of the PSD Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If they want to formalize it through an act of Congress, we'll do that, too.
There won't be any excitement about it.
"There are no elements, no voices in the party, no opinions in the party that would make anyone feel insecure about the government or that would give anyone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister", Dragnea said at the end of the PSD National Standing Bureau meeting.
PSD has announced when it will hold a congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message is given if the government is to continue or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I'll sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the party leadership", Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's PSD National Standing Bureau meeting.
Asked if the hesitation to announce his candidacy was related to his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my party colleagues to announce or not announce my candidacy the moment the date of the Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation", Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic branches have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at the Bors customs with immigrants hidden in the truck
Two Sri Lankan nationals were detected Monday at the Bors border crossing trying to cross illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of a car driven by an Italian citizen.
Investigations revealed that the couple had paid the driver 4,000 euros to take them to France, reports the Border Police.
At the specific check, the border guards noticed a large travel bag in the cabin of the truck containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check of the means of transport.
On this occasion, the border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car manufacturer, among the plastic crates, two male persons.
Checks revealed that the persons in question, two 28-year-old men, are Sri Lankan nationals and asylum seekers in Romania.
"When questioned, the youths said that they intended to go to France, for which they contacted a fellow countryman, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to take them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person", says the Border Police press release.
The two migrants were charged with "attempting to cross the state border illegally".
Also, Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian citizen driving a Renault Magnum registered in Romania, transporting plastic crates for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours and will be presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians in the couple: men versus women
Most Romans are content with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the visit to Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of their relationship.
"However, 18% show themselves as 'slightly dissatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in the couple relationship, and another 18% declare 'appropriate'", is the conclusion of the study, as shown in a statement released on Tuesday, Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analysed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% adequate, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
For women, 33% were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% picked the right category.
When we look at satisfaction, we see that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state, we see a difference of two percent.
"Similarly, in the very dissatisfied situation, the largest difference was in the slightly dissatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent", the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also say that "Romanians feel they need something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1 on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe has once again embarrassed itself
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe had "put itself to shame" after Monday's failure of a ministerial meeting in Brussels on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
"Last night, Europe once again put itself to shame", said Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, at a press conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting EU structural funds to countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting in emergency session in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach agreement on the mandatory relocation of 120,000 refugees requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of Europe's worst migration crises since 1945.

Hundreds of people of all ages wait in a line that stretches from the entrance of the church to the side streets, to pass by the catafalque where the coffin with the lifeless body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor lies.
People wait for about an hour to get to the Church of St. George the New, where groups of up to 40 people enter.
Approximately 300 people per hour passed by the coffin with the lifeless body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor on Wednesday.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova came, starting on Tuesday, to pay homage to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, we only had so many people at the 300-year re-consecration of the church and the Great Church of St. Nicholas.

He said it was a great blessing this church of Brancoveanu.
He said: "Brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Michael the Brave, who took the hand of St. Nicholas".
"'Do you realize what a blessing this is for this country,' Vadim would tell me", the parish priest related.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor is to be buried Thursday at the Ghencea Civil Cemetery with full military honors.

He was the founder of the Greater Romania Party, a former member of the European Parliament and a former senator.
What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a career-defining decision as she must decide whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two have worked together this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician only joining the romance at major tournaments.
Simona had nothing but praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who's managed to stand up to the wayward athlete.
But the Adidas program ends at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a substantial contract or walk away.
We don't know exactly what's gonna happen yet.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer", Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, he's asking for a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last event Simona and Cahill will work together is the Tournament of Champions in Singapore.
It wasn't normal. I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca has revealed how he parted ways with the Romanian national team last fall.
The former coach confessed that he did not get along with the president of the FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he offered the head of the Federation a substantial raise to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I don't regret leaving the national team.
I was sorry then, I was leaving a job behind.
That's what I thought was right for me at the time, and I think it was right for me.
What happened to me when I was a coach, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with my predecessors at the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he got different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at that time, with the results I had, plus there was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, it went really well, and he probably changed his mind, too.
But I wanted to go.
If they really wanted me to stay, I offered them a contract extension.
We have about 400 and something thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I wasn't talking to Burleanu, I was talking to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group", Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
The technician accepted the offer to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Armour and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns to the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants trying to enter from Serbia despite Hungary erecting a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 policemen and two children were injured in the clashes, reports Russia Today.
So far 20 officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken in two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by all means", said the Hungarian Prime Minister's security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control the crowd with water cannons and tear gas as people threw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke through the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants at the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have also reinforced their law enforcement at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest has suspended the border crossing at Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted move to close its borders to stem the flow of migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that in addition to the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia he would erect one on the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the erection of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease from which a man suffers
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was drunk, he could barely stand and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he had not consumed alcohol, he was visibly intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk when I wasn't, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's a secret alcoholic'", he said, according to the Mirror.
When he saw his wife's videos of him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my own eyes and I wasn't there".
'It was awful, I couldn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath also smelled of alcohol.
The most sobering moment for Nick was when, after a minor car accident, he was found to have a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit, even though he had only had one beer the night before.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body makes all the carbohydrates he consumes ferment, turning them into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's illness was the wife herself.
There's no cure for the disease yet, but since he stopped eating carbs, Nick hasn't had any more episodes like this.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the service he received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be scrapped, reports BT.
The entire scene was captured on video and posted on the Internet, much to the amusement of viewers.
The man claimed that the car had malfunctions that endangered his life and that of his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car from didn't fix his problem as agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through in its efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on national territory", according to a press release.
The source quoted shows that the strategy aims at managing the phenomenon of immigration effectively, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and lines of action reflecting policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems encountered by the States in Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures are envisaged for the unitary and coherent management of situations arising from a possible inflow of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
'The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens coming from countries with migration potential or who may pose a threat to national security,' adds the same source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that may influence immigration and asylum, including the continuation of the conflict situation in Syria, the reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, the continuation of an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the continuation and intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more stringent checks on the legality of the stay of third-country nationals on Romanian territory and the proper application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also contain specific objectives relevant for the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the Romanian territory for third-country nationals who meet employment needs, promoting access for third-country nationals to Romanian higher education institutions for fields and professions identified as lacking.
As regards the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it is 'a means of setting out concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to tackle the growing migration phenomenon'.
Romania among top European labour market performers
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the highest increase in total labour costs among the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers' personnel costs.
The average labour costs of the sampled Union producers developed over the period considered as follows:
Romania ranks third in the EU for labour cost growth
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (down 2.9%), Cyprus (down 1.2%) and Italy (down 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in hourly labour costs in industry and services by 7,9% and 7,6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an increase in hourly labour costs of 5,8%.
The activity report of the TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The culture committees of the Parliament rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
17 MPs voted to reject the report, one against (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Permanent Joint Bureaux.
They'll decide, probably next week.
It will be debated at the next plenary session.
"I think that given the situation it will be done relatively quickly", said the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for the TVR management to be present at this meeting, given that no representative of the TVR management was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was sent to the members of the board of directors last night, about an hour before we knew the time, but today, after the meeting of the united offices, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting it.
I believe that the moment you are summoned, you being a public employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the assembled committees even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty, you are in an institution subordinate to Parliament", Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's joint culture committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The debts, we saw how they continued, they came up with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else's in these committees that the agreement with the banks and the tax authorities was lost, there are clear management problems", Severin said.
He added that once the activity report had been rejected by the plenary session, elections would be held for a new Management Board, which would choose the institution's Director-General.
I don't know who's going to be nominated for the job.
There will be no miracles.
The important thing is to make political decisions to make this institution work.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you there's going to be some genius who's going to stand in line here and fight.
I hope that the decision-makers, the plenum of the Parliament, by their vote will choose very wisely the people who will lead TVR.
It has to be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who he will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have - good sense in attitude towards employees because he is a mess of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you get 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation which is a disaster", concluded the chairman of the Senate Culture Committee.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, the President and CEO of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, asking Parliament to consider a series of measures that could save and guarantee the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV fee.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment and completion of HG 978/2003 on the public service television fee, in order to update the provisions in line with technological changes, as well as to regulate the procedure for the control of the payment of the TV fee and the finding of infringements and the application of sanctions and penalties.
It also wishes to issue a provision extending the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become mandated by SRTv for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In its view, a ceiling of 5% of the collection fee should be set.
Stelian Tanase asks for the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public broadcaster and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary allocations/funding for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - Football World Cup, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will become insolvent in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce court rulings, even if they are not final, and wage rights take precedence over any other obligation.
TVR's management made constant efforts to reduce personnel and production costs.
'As a result, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated and at the end of July TVR News was closed,' the letter from the president of TVR reads.
Tanase appreciates that the dire financial situation cannot be remedied by one's own efforts.
'Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Televiziunea Romana will find itself, sooner or later, unable to fulfil its public mission', the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to court
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by prosecutors from the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with a loss of approximately 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was remanded in custody on May 22.
He founded the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL with his mother in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigations revealed that, in order to avoid paying taxes to the State budget, representatives of a company specialising in the provision of security services had set up a criminal network made up of several companies, through which fictitious transactions had been detected.
"In fact, fictitious purchases of services would have been recorded in the company's accounts, which, in reality, were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by about 600,000 euros", explained the Romanian Police in a press release.
The sheiks have decided Sanmartean's fate
The sheiks of the Al-Ittihad club have decided the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the impresario of the entrepreneur Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Bologna is very pleased with the Sanmartean.
Lucian plays starter match by match and does it well.
The sheiks have also realized that he is the best and that it would be wrong to give him up.
They could have brought in another player, a much better player, but it didn't work out.
"There have been several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has materialized", Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice president of the Court of Accounts
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice president of the Court of Audit.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes in favor and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, informs Digi24.
Moreover, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment to this position and announced that they would challenge it at the CCR, given that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Accounts does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD Senator will occupy the position of Vice President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts, left vacant after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the world's sexiest actors:
As Bradley Cooper is set to play a chef in the movie "Burnt", the actor made a revelation his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he stated that he grew up mostly in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook".
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, to continue the same path.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian descent, so he spent his childhood cooking with his Italian grandmother, ContactMusic reports.
Asked about his future plans at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type to make five-year plans, "not even two".
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map", he said.
"I have dreams, things that you would laugh at if I told you", he said, adding that his childhood wish had come true.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who started directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday morning strongly condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's assertions that Hungary's policy makers are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational statements, insulted the whole of Hungary", the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians don't say such unchecked slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost support in Romania's domestic politics", the Hungarian foreign minister added, according to MTI.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the provocations coming from some Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; both in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in their treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!"
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is in favor of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are policymakers no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees are fleeing!
'I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we are seeing in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction with precisely these objectives and values!' underlined the Romanian head of the executive.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks about Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "mere lies", saying they were inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister are related to the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto was referring to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and I always say is that I am against the xenophobic discourse, the idea of closing the borders, that everyone who comes is a terrorist, is medieval nonsense, and I am totally against this approach.
If we can get more, we will, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with beatings and inserting.
"I don't agree with that", he told a news conference in Targu Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Hungarian government has decided to start preparations on the ground to extend the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to the Romanian border to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Subsequently, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that Hungary's decision to erect a border fence solves nothing of the refugee problem and "takes Hungary out of Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the crane crash in Mecca?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, owned by the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the crash of a crane on the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Friday, killing 107 people.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company "failed to comply with safety regulations", reports the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reports the BBC.
The company's executives have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case is completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
The Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Grand Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred during a thunderstorm on Friday evening when a crane, possibly unbalanced by strong wind gusts, crashed onto the eastern side of the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How The Hague Silenced Opposers
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer of all time, Gica Hagi has been labelled a poor coach after his retirement.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he owns.
Exactly one year after taking over the team, the King has shown that he is capable of turning a team struggling to avoid relegation into a top team.
Thus, after a year, Viitor recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 losses.
The record is one of a top team, competing in European cups.
Things took an even better turn for Viitor this season, as the team finished second in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
Viitorul also has the best attack in Ligue 1, with 20 goals (tied with Astra), more than double that of Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young players, and in the last period names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea appeared in the starting team.
The club's policy made Viitorul a team to watch for foreign teams, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to Steaua, Viitorul is the only profitable team in Ligue 1, according to the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far acted like a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like a seventh EU country.
Large countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, board member of the Romanian Centre for European Policy.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea pointed out that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress and that purely police methods will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people bring".
But there are masses that have been set in motion and we can't reverse history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best we can and make them adapt to us.
According to Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to today's situation".
Where are we on the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the polls said he'd get the votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the principle of unanimity applied in JHA and any Member State could block any decision.
That is why there has been very little integration in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, whereby the Commission takes the initiative and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the Member States, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it's such a sensitive issue, there was a backlash even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's open-door policy, and they didn't want it to come across in many countries as "the EU is sending us migrants".
So they postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for Schengen governance and we're probably going to see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of the Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of Member States at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migration has stretched the limits of the old Schengen system.
Maybe the Dublin principle, where migrants are the responsibility of the first country they enter, will be abandoned, because it's not sustainable.
If Greece collapses, you can't keep saying it's Greece's business.
It's a common problem.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for sharing the effort of reception?
Nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work, if at all.
Because one problem remains: what do you do with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European countries are going to start picking up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will probably lead to single filtering centres in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The fact is that we're talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are living in precarious camps and who have just started to go to Europe.
One estimate is that only 10% have left, the Mediterranean is hard to cross in winter, but we expect an even bigger wave next year.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so catastrophically from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with more or less experience.
Do you think there is any place that has really succeeded in integrating large groups from a non-European culture?
I look at the Maghreb in France, the Turks in Germany, they're all enclaved.
I wouldn't go in for radical statements.
Of course, integrating them is more difficult than with other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't integrate at all.
There's a disconnected part that's creating major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
Fortress Europe is an illusion.
The mechanisms of integration into European societies need to be examined.
There have been some mistakes here.
We have to be more sophisticated.
Let's ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
But you have to separate the immediate problem of these people from the long-term problem of integrating them.
Just because others have failed to integrate in the long term doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people bring.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean it's going to rebuild the country overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders are being closed, walls are being built, border controls are being reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such did not, the Schengen area as it was constructed did.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
I mean, we're free to move around, but we all have our own problems.
In the face of such a wave you can't do that, because some countries can't cope.
When there are these waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France we don't have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
There's a wave of public emotion building both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be manly.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion is stirred.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European single market.
And I don't think the Europeans are going to give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is another.
Schengen is now like an animal that was created in another era and was not adapted to today's situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
It's like a small country that thinks if you pull the blinders over your eyes and plug your ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your small country's problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like a seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians' appetite for Schengen will decrease a lot.
President Iohannis says it's probably a good thing we're not in yet.
So we move from the desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen that migrants will see us as the alternative route.
Which is not a reason not to join Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become a shared responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules for deporting those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president was saying that after Russia shifted its focus from Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two fires, a Russian game?
Russia is behaving like a frustrated power.
She thinks being a great power means confusing the Americans and the Europeans.
From that point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, it is likely that the Assad regime would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good that it collapsed before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For about two years, there was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias backed by Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose, and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia may have complicated things, but it can't be part of the solution.
It creates pockets of instability and chaos that it can't close.
But you're only great power if you also have solutions.
Playing the offside is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to push the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers aren't coming because people aren't convinced that he can somehow solve the problems he's created.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are being driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not make Putin more powerful than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have grown accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the social network is preparing its opposite, the "Dislike" button.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's co-founder and chief executive, announced on his account that the button will be available soon, the New York Times reports on its blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button would show a shade of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised concerns that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid moments where someone posts on his account about an important life event, and someone else dislikes it.
Users of the network, which has grown to 1.5 billion active accounts, have long requested the ability to express their negative emotions or empathize with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that he's not really comfortable with people liking current events, like the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable liking that post", the Facebook representative pointed out.
The idea of a new Facebook button wasn't welcomed by everyone.
"There's already enough hate on Facebook and social media", Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan commented on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'm going to dislike the dislike button", he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it's hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she claims, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of the thousands arriving en masse at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along its border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing it would build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The move drew a sharp reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border to those who want to cross, but not to those who want to claim asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different", said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Ahead of the imposition of new immigration laws, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said Monday.
Also, over 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" County Council building is falling down.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments made here in the last few years to move the institution are about to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went bankrupt during the works.
The County Council building on Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up falling down by itself.
A year and a half after the consolidation and redevelopment of the building should have been completed, the work is not even half done.
A final stage in the building's epic has been consummated in recent days, when the National Council for the Settlement of Disputes (CNSC) rejected a complaint of the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the constructor and the interruption of the works, negotiation procedures were initiated without publication of a contract notice with Impex Romcatel, which was to update the technical design and then organise a new tender for the works.
'The negotiations did not result in a contract, however, as the CJ considered that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage,' summarised Razvan Timofciuc, the CJ's public relations representative.
The CJEU's decision to discontinue direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
According to the Icelandic authorities, there is no evidence that the Icelandic financial market has been negatively affected by the collapse of Kaupthing.
But that doesn't mean CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to challenge the CNSC's decision before the Court of Appeal, and only after a final judgment by the CNSC can the possibility of finding another designer be considered.
Thus, work on strengthening the building could be resumed next year at the earliest.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, it shouldn't take long to rebuild the technical project, but we have to reach a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC decision will be appealed or not", Timofciuc said.
Work to consolidate the former headquarters of the Police Headquarters began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of RON 4,5 million had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded to Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company became insolvent, and this contract was terminated after payments of RON 1.5 million had been made.
Work has so far been carried out at a rate of approximately 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, re-functionalization and attic of the building had been valued at RON 7,7 million.
'That's it, I'm telling everything!' - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Land Registry
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case at the Land Registry Office signed an agreement to confess in exchange for a suspended prison sentence.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
A councillor from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iași accused by the DNA in a corruption case has admitted his deeds.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Court of Iasi, the judges determining to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was charged with continuous intellectual forgery and agreed to serve two years of deferred imprisonment as well as community service.
As regards the facts imputed to Dascalu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Land Registry Office, together with other colleagues, 'falsely drew up several minutes of acceptance, concerning the service contracts previously concluded by the OCPI Iași with the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agenția de Cadastru și Topografie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, which unrealistically attested that the contracted services were fully performed, in the conditions in which they were not performed and were not submitted to the OCPI Iași'.
A few days ago, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, and other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to court in this case, the accusations being the settlement of some services to the companies mentioned, although the work was not done.
The damage exceeds RON 300,000.
Adventures in the stone age
According to the president of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's national handball team for qualifying for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, in a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the Romanian women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this they have to go through two stages of caudine forks, first the World Championship and second the prequalification tournament", Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic demands from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will consist of seven or eight people.
He wants an assistant coach, a doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeping coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to qualify for things, specifically physical training materials, that we'd never heard of.
These are all to get to the Olympics, and I will do everything in my power to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, a lot of money.
But that's the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age of preparation.
"The teams we are fighting have these materials and have had them for some time", said Dedu, who mentioned that they are trying to obtain the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a hall in Bucharest.
It's an infrastructure issue, and it's shameful that a European gymnastics championship is being questioned.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world, entire Olympic districts have been built in the space of two years.
Before 1992, the current Olympic site in Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beacon of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympic Games were also a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition", Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
It's a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Puss went in with a civil project, the people agreed in principle, but it became clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they agreed to invite them to the first match in the new arena in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
"So we have all the openness, both at EHF and at IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure", the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they do not come true they turn against them".
Have a good trip to the World Cup.
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday in a press conference that all the components of Romania's lot are ready for the matches at the World Cup in England, where they hope to get two victories: "We are ready".
My colleagues and I are firing on all cylinders.
We've trained to give our best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All bands are hard, and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But for sure, if we win against Canada, the game against Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the culmination of so many years of work.
My wish is not to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and to bring home beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family as rugby is in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor", said Macovei.
The coach of the Romanian national team, Lynn Howells, on his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It's an amazing experience for me.
It's very important for me to make the Romanians proud of the national team at every match.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the top of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends, who set out to achieve a dream", said Dumitraş.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on September 23 in London; with Ireland, on September 27 in London; with Canada, on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy, on October 11 in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the match between England and Fiji in Group A.
New courses of Japanese culture organized at "Al.I. Cuza" University
You can learn about flower arrangement in a vase, ink painting, but also a light study of the fine arts specific to the Land of the Rising Sun at courses organized by students from Iasi.
The Japanese Culture Students' Circle in Iasi is organizing new courses of Japanese culture (ikebana, sumie and fine arts) between October 2015 and June 2016, courses for both beginners and advanced people.
These will take place at the Centre for European Studies of "Al. I. Cuza" University in Iasi and are organised to promote traditional and modern Japanese arts and culture.
For these there is a single participation fee of 50 lei per month per person.
In addition to art lessons, participants will be able to take part in exhibitions and other cultural activities promoting beauty.
The Japanese culture courses that I have proposed to you have been conceived as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"Interested people will be able to learn how to make harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to capture the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of ink painting (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the multi-purpose universe of fine arts (graphic, drawing, painting) ", said Sorin Mazilu, the teacher of these courses.
The courses are aimed at all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registration is open until 30 September, and those wishing to request more information can do so by calling 0742.027.153 or by e-mailing studenticultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei given to the "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Iasi at the budget rectification
What will be purchased with this important sum of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget rectification, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received for use until the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and fitting-out of clinics and in medical equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new computer tomograph, a new radiology machine, six surgical kits, six appropriately equipped ICU beds, an ophthalmic microscope and other necessary medical equipment.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget amendment, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will receive the works of the bridge that connects the UPU to the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics", explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have the Tătărași Dermatology Clinic in the yard, which will be organized in the outpatient department, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the outpatient allergology, haematology and endocrinology departments are located and will have approximately 30 beds.
The coward, made a fool of by RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Misadventures of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After our experience, neither my wife nor I want to set foot in your town again.
Unwittingly, they encountered erroneous information in the leaflets, the insensitivity of the RAPT inspectors, and, bonus, a fine "according to the law".
The couple arrived in Iasi a few days ago, checked into a downtown hotel and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a leaflet listing the RATP routes.
"Armed" with these maps, the couple visited Iasi.
But two days ago, out in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palace Mall.
Since there was no ticket machine at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they boarded a bus and tried to text the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there hasn't been a service for two years and it's been announced in the press that it's been cancelled.
How would I know what was written in the local press, coming the night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they can do is give us one fine instead of two.
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visiting day standing at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!", says Ovidiu.
As a result, the family was fined because of the erroneous information in the leaflet and because the inspectors "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a complaint to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's not about the money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the point is that I felt cheated.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and were remanded in custody
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal of Iasi.
Magistrates in Iasi tried the first term of the trial in a closed session in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the hearing, one of the judges from Iasi to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request to abstain, which was accepted by his colleagues in the court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Criminal Section, and it was he who, on 9 April, accepted an appeal by four of the defendants, ordering their placement under house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a panel that includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, Judge Dan Anton abstained from the case on the grounds that his daughter was in a common-law relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges ruled that the Vaslui rapists remain in custody.
The young people will remain in detention for at least another 30 days, when the judges will reconsider their release.
The next hearing will take place at the Iași Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal of Iasi, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the neighborhood of Păcurari, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco van in which the seven rapists were travelling hit a Volkswagen car which had left Canta Street and the driver tried to turn left.
The van was coming from the end of Pacurari.
The car entered Iasi through here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi via Grajduri, then on the ring road.
They thus shortened the trip by several miles.
Immediately after impact, the detainee escort called for another transport to pick up the prisoners.
Shortly after, a car from the Iași Maximum Security Prison was sent to the scene of the accident, which picked up the seven inmates and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of those arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the rear of the cars and the detainees sped out, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police because the drivers of the two vehicles agreed on the damages to be paid", said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Țăranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is coming.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and loudly: the almost 7000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 people, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants do accept to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely low.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlopers and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The failure to integrate Gypsies is just one banal example.
In addition, governments of all stripes have been unable to absorb European funds, build modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent health care, clean up the streets, create decently paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country they're fleeing?
But what is especially puzzling is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is handled.
First, there is the bellicose hypocrisy of the powerful EU states, which are extremely generous when it comes to sharing the burdens of smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably afraid someone will steal his national essence.
Finally, there is the hypocrisy of many migrants who, while invoking only the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, accept no other destination for the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Now, not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be ridiculed.
The causes must be addressed, some argue, and, strictly on the political correctness card, they call for peace and investment in migrants' home countries.
But in Romania there is peace and even some foreign capital enters the national economy from time to time - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, divided and outdated construction.
We lamented the fact that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but here the EU has no plan for the future.
And improvising and threatening doesn't help.
So what good is the EU if the only advantage Romanians enjoy - the right to free movement - could be jeopardised by waves of refugees streaming across borders?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion and so on will drive millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa to seek a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination practically imposed
The concession tender covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Museum of Romanian Literature is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a usable area of 134 sqm, on two rough levels.
The CJ only accepts the use of the building as a literary café, bookstore or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at EUR 68,300, with a starting bid of EUR 6,830 per year, with a bidding step of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building on a continuous and permanent basis and fully cover the costs of rehabilitating the building in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
'The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of deterioration due to the fact that neither during the period in which the public catering facility operated in these premises, nor after its evacuation, were routine repair and maintenance works carried out as are normally required during the operation of a building,' states the tender documentation.
Bids for the concession of the club are expected by 18 September.
Two brothers from Tomesti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-old and 11-year-old children from Tomesti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on medication, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the "Sfânta Maria" hospital in Iasi.
They're in stable condition, according to the doctors.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that will break your heart.
At 20, she received a courageous gift: biological parents.
Lost in the hospital in unclear circumstances, in the dark of the 90s, when she was only two months old, small, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl from Iasi, now a blonde and beautiful girl, was reunited the day before yesterday in Iasi with her biological parents from a village in the county, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina is about to turn 20 years old, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have decided to give their beloved daughter a surprising and brave gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to learn about her unclear past.
"Ziarul de Iași", which witnessed the efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporters' accounts, the emotions of the moment, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
Crina's story begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, Iasi, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
My parents quarreled, and my mother left home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't heard from her since.
"By the time I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late", recalls Alina, the girl's grieving mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pașcani, and the girl's father, Costică Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives were about to end forever.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After Crina's admission, her father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
It must have been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She must have thought she was abandoned", says a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child in all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, which then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
Those were years when abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but could not.
They immediately fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would move permanently with them to Italy.
She was almost two years old by the time the adoption was finalized.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our daughter.
"It's as if my wife gave birth to her", smiles Salvadore, her adoptive father, as he takes her fragile hand in his.
In the country, Crinia's parents, Alina and Costica, continued the search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child could be.
The police then told her that she might be dead, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the court that she had gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her I never had.
We prayed to God that he was okay.
I've thought about it all these years, but there's been no way to walk around and find it.
"It's hard", says Crina's biological mother with tears in her eyes.
But even after all these years, the parents in Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past linked her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to get to know my Romanian parents", says a delighted Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling in Iași, was contacted by an acquaintance in Italy who explained Salvadore's desire to find Crina's biological family.
And the searches started with just one name.
Following a request from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I only got one name, Balkan Costica, then the town, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there by locality the name received.
That's when they gave me some leads, only the person they found wasn't the person they were looking for.
"It took us about a month to finally find the girl's biological father", explains Chief Commissioner Romică Ichim.
Altogether, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costică and Alina, especially since they lived in different towns.
We started the process around March, and by June-July we had completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
"We then arranged for a first meeting to be held in September", added Romică Ichim.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica saw their lost daughter for the first time in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The emotional father could hardly hold back his tears, and his hands were trembling uncontrollably.
He barely exchanges a few words with anyone.
The week before the meeting, he could barely sleep.
He was all excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years is something", says a granddaughter, who also came with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Carina's reunion with her biological mother and brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is about to study at a prestigious university in Italy, Costica Balcan told her, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to his village, she should come quietly: he could give her some sheep, goats, so that she could find a village boy and start a household.
The mother is also emotional, crying, and finds it hard to believe that this could happen to her.
I'm really excited.
I never thought something like this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking about it all these years, I've been hoping, but I never thought I could be like that.
There are very big emotions.
If only he could forgive me.
I hope we can visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep in touch", says Crinia's mother, Alina, with tears welling up in her eyes.
In it she also hides her tears of happiness, because soon she will see her daughter after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will turn 20 in just a few days this month, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
She thinks they're young, but now before the meeting she's trying to gather her thoughts, because she has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But my parents are ultimately the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a good memory with them, because now there is so much to talk about", says Carina.
First family reunion in Iași
In Union Square, under the early autumn sky, the Ruginoasa family reunites their destiny with their Palermo daughter.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They are no longer divided by borders or countries, but only by a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian restaurant owner in the center of Iasi, they passed easily.
Those who made this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind ever, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It's the first event of its kind organized, of such an emotional charge, and I'm glad it's a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who use, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give something back to society.
"If I'm asked again for an event like this, I'll do it with great pleasure", says Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counselling Centre in Iași, with a smile.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walk away talking.
They're understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with the guns down, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone 's taking a deep breath
The camps in the Iasi branch of the PSD concluded a ceasefire at gunpoint.
After successive rounds of talks from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Under pressure from the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the exiting Social Democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for party positions.
Far from over, the internal party war seems to have merely paused to allow the combatants to catch their breath.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very timely message in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd we have party elections.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure", said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend have only led to the conclusion that nothing definite has been settled.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the county branch of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the party's branch in Iasi are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councilor Vasile Câtea and the interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is the candidacy of the leader of the county councilors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will not enter the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day nominations can be filed, and it wouldn't surprise anyone if that happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain so after 3 October, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Office and all new management structures", Câtea said.
Until the organization of internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on vacation until September 29, and the preparation of the elections will be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of PSD Iași, the list remaining open", commented Stanciu.
A judge from Iasi refused the case of the rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of cohabitation
The seven young people from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iași Court of Appeal.
Vasluians sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will today present their arguments regarding their release, after the court of first instance, Vaslui Court, established their incarceration immediately after the sentence.
The case was filed in the Court of Appeals late last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton filing a motion to dismiss, which was granted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' attorneys, attorney Bogdan Luca, is the common-law husband of his daughter, attorney Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest sentence in this case.
How the Judges Reasoned
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people gave reasons for the sentence.
In his reasoning, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The court finds that after the placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, a measure restricting freedom but not depriving of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of indignation was felt at the local and national community level about the fact that persons accused of serious offences are tried under a less restrictive measure, "says the reasoning of the Vaslui Court.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
'The court emphasises that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants have sought to highlight through the defenses they have formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext,' the reasoning also states.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades cannot continue in the coming years.
Until Saturday probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing Labour leader since the war.
An avowed Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once called on then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), fiercely anti-American and a supporter of Vladimir Putin (he has been regularly invited to comment on political events by the Russia Today television channel), and the terrorist movements Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up its nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time regarded the killing of Osama bin Laden as a tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Like all populist demagogues, Corbyn of course has anti-austerity silver bullets.
The kind of things that Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he faced the real world and the economic realities.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader envisages, among other things, massive renationalisations and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the printing money solution is not universally adopted across the globe, we would then have a general global prosperity!
Sure, we can tax the bankers to the bone, make them some kind of official enemy of the left, but as we've seen so many times in the past, not just in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The additional sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, empty promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, 'the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money'.
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a realistic chance of ever becoming Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in his beliefs as the new party leader anyway, failed miserably in the elections.
And there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively substantial and structured.
And the unions were considerably more influential than they are now.
In the context of the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the workforce and extensive automation has left industry in massive need of highly skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
But even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit, the United Kingdom's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with the radical right's anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the EU, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide, in a referendum to be held by 2017, to leave the Union, the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep rifts created within it by the Euro crisis and now by the refugee crisis, between North and South, between East and West, leaves room for the most worrying scenarios.
This was all the more so as, for a number of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin was increasingly becoming the dominant player).
It's true, Britain's business community, the City, are strong advocates of remaining in the EU.
But today's Europe is not the Europe of the past.
There's a lot of resentment, and it's growing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we had a sample of it just recently in Jean-Claude Juncker's speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of member states by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening at a time when electoral support for anti-establishment, anti-immigration parties that are also Eurosceptic is rising dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
Hence the conclusion reached by the Financial Times when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation of the national interest.
If voters make the cerebral decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in politics today.
Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of interest and decision-making in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from the accumulated frustrations in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, Eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that took into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may seriously affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to rule anything out in terms of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancusi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Go and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a big dream: to be somebody, to become famous, to be heard all over the world.
But behind his fame lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories, recipes for success in life, are delivered to us.
And that something has a name.
It's called hard work.
What to write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say, really?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a commercial.
Brancusi produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards named after him.
By the way, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when she goes outside with her cub, she hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brancusi's".
The country is littered with his statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancusi's ability to infiltrate is enormous.
Even the communists failed to eradicate it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are now all over the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what would there be to say, to write about this man?
Seen from the pile of books and articles that attempt to reconstruct his fate, Brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that unless you're lucky enough to be born in a big city and into a moderately wealthy family, your chances of success in life are pretty much nil.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget about the crappy success stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on television.
Look closely at this man's face.
Do you want to know how he made it in life, how, today, the whole world heard about him?
It's as simple as that.
He's worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobița, a small village in the commune of Peștișani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brancusi led a modest life, but one from which he would pick up the landmarks that would guide his later artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess in a meeting with Petre Țuțea in Paris in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, humans have happily lived a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
Brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years spent in his native village.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși.
In 1879, Constantin Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the cottage cheese was being made "in the cauldron", watching those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going well, Brancusi catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills the cups of his hands with brandy and drinks without stopping.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
It takes the first humans a few minutes to notice.
The mother panics, then hysterics, thinking her son is dead.
Towards evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by lutenists, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those waiting for him with bated breath.
The party quickly turns to mourning.
Father's already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandușa, doctor and servant of the Brancusi.
The midwife checks the baby's breathing, then places horse manure, collected from the surrounding area, under the baby's nose.
The child sneezes loudly.
People are applauding.
While the boy is allowed to sleep off his joy drunkenness, the lute party continues with even more vigor.
The next day, father and son meet by the orchard.
Radu Brancusi has Constantine gather some sticks and bring them to him.
The father puts his child upside down and, with the sticks brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And as he feels the sting of the blows, little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around him can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in his old age, if the star itself did not participate in his disturbance.
Was the sun as troubled by what had happened to him as his father had been?
Currently, the city is not functioning
An MP appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blajuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we're seeing right now in our political landscape is a great divide and that's it.
I haven't seen anything from the 2012 USL Draft to go on.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see politicians fighting over possible sites based on real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside for a moment, get together and talk.
Currently, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with the civil war, you don't have time for the people who elected you", said Owl.
He considered that the current political class had disappointed the electorate of Iasi, the consequence of which would be a very low turnout at the next local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MEP also believes that voters will still turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party to be launched today.
The local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties rely on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is fragmenting even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD", said Blajut.
He stated that he is not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for Mayor.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I'm still considering whether to continue as a deputy in the next term.
I tried to call for unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the corridors, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it does not mean that they are stupid to vote for us if they do not see anything", said Blăjuț, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of elected officials.
A colleague from Tatarasi said he didn't have enough money and had to go by bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's no shortage of money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to take money from the cashier.
At the end of my term, I'll make a report of everything I've spent, except for the salaries of the cabinet employees and its maintenance.
It happened that in one month I also raised 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and other bills.
"It is pure hypocrisy for a parliamentarian to say that he does not have enough money", Blăjuț concluded.
