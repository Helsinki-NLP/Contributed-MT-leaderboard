While there appears to be one experimental vaccine that could reduce Ebola mortality, as yet, there are no suitable drugs to treat existing infections.
There was a combination of one antibody, ZMapp, and there were initial hopes for this, but formal studies showed that the benefits of this combination were less than those needed to reduce mortality.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that the scientists took it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already popular theory, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown from the snout and its underside was pale or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not contain a fully developed bone chain, called a "spine", but possessed secondary characteristics of feathers - such as bumps and small projections - researchers concluded that the spine was most likely an evolutionary outgrowth of these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the rump of a juvenile dinosaur.
The researchers noted that although this tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult bird feathers and not juvenile dinosaur.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at a police station in the Gaziantep region of Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

As for the work done, it is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Milky Way.
The effect that the team investigated is due to tidal and island forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is wrapped in a halo-like envelope, consisting of small particles in large numbers.

Candidates can designate representatives to observe each part of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision following a set procedure.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gaj Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit me, none of them were injured.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries .
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT .
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is currently in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness may be questionable since her photo has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have held that the publication of photographs can be considered biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that ""It seems that journalists are certainly taking a risk if they publish photographs or material that involves suspects".""
The Crown Prosecution Service indicated to reporters that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the border, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, an issue of importance to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
The guards had to supervise the shooters closely in a supplemental pesticide experiment, and the experiment was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, they selected qualified volunteers under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunt underwent extensive safety and training exercises.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is Martelli's fifth temporary election in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
Demonstrations, sometimes violent, have erupted over the failure to hold elections scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of vulnerabilities, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded to Apple's call for a postponement of the report as "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there were no indications of a tsunami wave.
A former Filipino policeman took two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila , the capital of the Philippines .
Rolando Mendoza fired his M-16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were quickly released, including children and a young man, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The cameraman then took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and was appointed to the Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His research has shown that the secretion of a certain hormone will accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorder or "black box" on Wednesday.
We received a lot of praise from colleagues.
"Luna was my first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna, died on a moonlit night. A strong, unique woman", said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "She was as eccentric a color as I am ... maybe more so ... I loved her and I miss her ... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced during the 2010 federal election campaign that she envisioned Australia becoming a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness became questionable due to his complaint, as he was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the 3 m springboard at the Commonwealth Games.
He can 't take the medication he needs for the pain because it 's forbidden in the games .
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth as well as organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed from a comet impact long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense".
He is likely to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks, parking facilities or on-street parking.
Concerns about transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, without fans present.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was previously thought to take much longer in Hawaii - due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the sharp-billed ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn as a thin wire that can be twisted and screwed. It can be rolled or folded into sheets.
It could be flattened very thinly, and glued onto another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It is called the pH of a chemical substance, and an index of this number can be determined using red cabbage juice.
The color of orange juice changes depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H for pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
The dry powder should be stirred together and then squeezed with clean, wet hands until it forms a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, a toilet had a drainage mechanism in almost every house and was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan townhouses on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public baths where men and women entered together in mixed spaces.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost instantly.
A satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
We need a giant rocket more than 100 feet (30 meters) high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
Bicycles have changed the shape of the world dramatically; however, their most important contribution to us has been to provide an easier and faster means of transportation.
It led to the invention of the train, the automobile, and many other transportation devices.
Next to them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to sheep to deer.
Finally, there are a variety of small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of status, a special function for each zodiac sign that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The lion family consists of one to three adult males, as well as about 35 females and cubs.
The females are usually closer together, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, animals similar to lions (but not other big cats) behave and are very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim and leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, jaguars, and jaguars. These four are the only ones that can visit.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but is more like a shout with angry words.
Leopard geckos prefer to eat smaller animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals preyed upon by leopard geckos are smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that leopard geckos track and locate prey using their sense of smell; smelling where they are on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and move very quietly. Leopard geckos hunt their prey by camouflaging their surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) is separated from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in an environment that is different from the one it was in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly formed group will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it previously needed.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, because they still need the same methods of adaptation as we are used to.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups would appear so different that they could no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its era, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
It had two long jaws with more than 70 blade-like teeth and a second set at the top of its mouth, which meant that nothing could get in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other dinosaurs, and it may have been carnivorous.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called the vole.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men liked to sit together and recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, beets, or cacao and none of the ancient Romans ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and considered it the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs during festivals and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a secure vault that only priests can enter.
Unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not of great importance.
Most of the Arab family's life was outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open-air caf√©s facing the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited sporadically. According to stories in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, he reached Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there previously.
There were notable differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, although they were all Scandinavian countries.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably noticed that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that 's not true. Although there is something on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known with certainty, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 75.5 cm by 24 1‚ÅÑ2 inches by 62.2 cm) was folded and stored early in its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still unliberated.
Vichy France was ruled by a group of Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies occupied southern France, an invasion code-named Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town-state, and is also loosely defined as a social mass.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original 13 states formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and because it had no national executive or judicial branch, it depended on state governments, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it does not have the authority to override interstate tax and tariff laws.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended and the states mocked the central government so much that most of their representatives were absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, sledge hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century and European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Iha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on the citrus and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Antihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
Further production has continued to the present day, but more importantly the image sensors in digital cameras have inherited their higher aspect ratio.
The 35 mm model is, in fact, a bit confusing, being 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the smallest integer) 3:2.
Many common formats (a set of AVCHD formats, for example) equal or approximate this aspect ratio.
Misused and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order.
The most striking location of the main subject is said to be the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power he possessed affected everyone from the king to the common people.
A central Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church coffers exist specifically for this reason.
The Church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this focus on power and money led many to question whether it met the requirements of dogma.
Britain quickly initiated a naval blockade of Germany after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified and coordinated by several international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the oceans, which even threatened neutral shipping.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected the same response for its own unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or dynasties had a different kind of power.
In addition, Akko between each dynasty was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods a fierce war arose between various nobles who wanted to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history in which thousands of people died fighting for the top positions in the Great Hall of Xi'an.
There was a fascination with social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to the ruler alone.
After the Revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the army because instead of the army's classifications being based on class, they are now based on criteria.
The French Revolution also inspired a passion among other oppressed working classes in other countries to foment their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor for meditation.
The garment itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you know it is there. Once you enter the cave, you will be completely isolated.
You can see nothing but a beautiful clear sky over the many mountains surrounding the place. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramids built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (most notably the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and a Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
A "turn up" sign will look like a V and a "turn down" sign will look like a button or a square missing a bottom edge.
A high mark means you should start at the tip and push the bow, while a low mark means you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to make your own markings in pencil, but remember that curved printed markings are there for a musical reason, so they should always be respected.
Frightened, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people who were shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
A crowd managed to force the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
A gangster once waved the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Philippine people bore the brunt of the U.S. imperialist war with its invasion of the Philippines.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of U.S. imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the Order, in order to understand the Templars.
The era during which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages and is the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and technological manifestations.
There are two general ideas shared by most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely exceeds cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on embedded, rather than social, societies.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily leads to better roads.
But building a nationwide road network is considered economically feasible because there are fewer cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also causing an increase in road accidents, and this is leading to the development of new healthcare technologies to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with this geography were formed, and these, as consistent with a society's location, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed rules.
While Paris was known as the capital of love in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of love in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were of higher value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Paris was dubbed the capital of love instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East heavily influenced clothing.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles lag behind by about 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades that led people to use laces to bind clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming, often organic, is a simple system using stored seeds adapted to the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Most farmers historically worked as subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disconnected from societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through a distinctive and traditional use of style that includes clothing, make-up, and jewelry.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization relies on the unfortunate few cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, suffered from being socially disconnected from adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children are kept by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to severely disable the child mentally or physically.
Feral children may have been abused as children or suffered severe trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been domesticated by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
For those raised by animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble pet-specific behaviors, such as fear of humans or indifference to them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
An interactive learning process is not a method of instruction but rather an auxiliary tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be both virtual and physical, in other words, a teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is a Microsoft Office clipboard.
Interactive learning is supported internally by the program and aims to ask questions, stimulate and explain actions that would be difficult for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing and nurturing and nurturing, but that is what these children will become.
We know that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care must provide all the necessities that were lacking in the previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of public and private communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage patterns and saturation modes.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) who studied audience reaction to websites".
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the president's speech indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess truthfulness.
It has been suggested that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals, such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a latent group and a manifest group.
Mutations add new genetic variants, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive variants.
The processes of segregation and recombination cause variation to randomly shift back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will result in dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins that they could get from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should be no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees did on the savannah.
Sleep bruxism is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet stimulus to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while you are sleeping, you should leave it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other options, based on biochemistry, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get out of bed and go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positivity the life force provides. Everyone has the potential to find inner peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, and this led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, a clash of regimes, actions, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to continue for the next 40 years, fought on the ground, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union forming the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interdicting your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was attempting to repel this invasion and was strengthening its submarine force.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were raised in herds on hills or secondary grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Carriage roads were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railway carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to greater speeds and to haul larger loads than the more rugged roads of the time.
Rail tracks were invented relatively early to stabilize tracks, but it became clear over time that placing an iron bar on top of the track made it more effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused further corrosion of the carriage's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the earliest mode of transportation. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Bipedal forms of Australopithecus have been found in fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Coelenthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as treating symptoms with a placebo. However, if we want only a temporary solution, we have to get to the root of the problems, and we have to solve them.
The world is obviously changing rapidly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancement, and the problems are only getting bigger due to the increasing population and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks from John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap Cash Booklets".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8.
He sent a copy to George Washington on July 6, and read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios represent the earliest surviving copies of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is damaged.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Some people think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But I am a fan of things that have to do with birds and look like dinosaurs .
It had two legs with protective outer plates and claws, was oviparous, and walked on its hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Symptoms of internal poisoning may not appear immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs have a long incubation period, during which they adapt to living in their host's nest or home.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their children .
In the process of adoption, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that other spouses can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is not unique to this field, however; experimentation is testing that can be used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including matters of psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend critically on the presence of circadian rhythms and are produced by biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external circadian signals, have been documented for most organisms, including the circadian rhythms of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Circadian clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first demonstrations that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Only two experiments have been performed to label either bacterial DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations can only be passed on in germline cells to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work and are met on the way by people from work who have recovered from their illness.
With this dynamic mode of transportation, everyone is supported and somewhat connected to a car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems. Everybody complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why are there such complaints about transportation systems, which fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, the driver tends to behave within a reasonably orderly range; therefore, traffic has a reasonably orderly flow, which can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships are established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by the ability to fold their wings to accommodate their body length.
This gives them a larger variety of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people found this to be true but a minority of people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the ground moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching 6 miles (9.6 km) in width.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza are unsurpassed in size and architectural excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most civil servants, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and all of these elements can be found in nature in native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything was composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are, of course, minerals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also find alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. And all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil was a good hobbyist friend of the people who showed up.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil was relegated to lesser status and uses.
Nowadays people type messages on computer screens, without having to use a clipboard.
One can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when a newer invention comes along.
A fission bomb works by accumulating energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy car rolling up a hill. The nucleus splits again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker at higher elevations.
There may have been a lunar impact crater on the near side because the crust was less dense. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are more about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that automatically emerge as they reach adulthood.
These theories explore what makes some people want the things they want and the things in their environment that make them want or dislike certain things.
The two most popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two types of behavior may be exhibited by those whom managers perceive to be led by their former peers and one of these is trying to be "like everyone else".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary procedures, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, the individual becomes someone else who feels that he or she must change everything that the group values and owns.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same criteria of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams because their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" is described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the "Invisible Team" management team. The "Invisible Team" maintains standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create a learning organization with a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and efficiency can be achieved.
As a result, collaboration within an organization to overcome obstacles can result in new innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry. This narrows the research area and makes it more narrowly focused.
The connection between neurology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in a way never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automatically perform all tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is used today in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been used to build various software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any class. Often a teacher will want to take her students to places where going by bus is not possible.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to revisit a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website describing their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned each year, but they keep older versions online to serve as a record of their trip.
Forums can help students improve their writing. For those students who express their experience in forums with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a forum writer tends to write better in order to avoid criticism.
Forums also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to feed the public's attention inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of forums can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to online material, students can identify their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada 's charming bilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada 's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the beautifully unspoiled nature reserve of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario what outsiders perceive as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated and partly uninhabited.
For a startling demographic comparison: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is the largest of all, and is a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama established a Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is preferable for women to declare that they are married, regardless of actual social status.
It is helpful to wear loose-fitting clothing (but not the kind that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may consider harassment or unusual behavior, such as being stalked, handcuffed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences make this unacceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as "Casa Branca", and abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, and Spanish merchants renamed it Casablanca and established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to see that there are places selling traditional Moroccan goods all over the old city, such as crockery, pottery, leather goods, rugs and all sorts of cheap products, but these are all intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which flooded most of the city streets, especially in the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is important to check before making any visits outside Goma, to understand the situation of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and is one of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride a boda boda (a type of motorcycle used as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the typical fare (locally) is about 500 CFA for a short trip.
In addition to being relatively difficult to reach, Timbuktu was used as a passage to distant foreign lands.
Nowadays Timbuktu is considered a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, as well as having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main locations for Henry Louis Gates' PBS special series on the Wonders of the African World.
The city is strikingly different from the rest of the cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most visited attractions and is a major park of the South African National Parks (SANPs).
There are daily fees for park maintenance and admission is free, as in all South African national parks.
It may be worth buying a Wild Card, as it gives you access to a selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists visit.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong 's skyline resemble a glowing diagram rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong , walk around the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side .
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists used to make their homes, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to look.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) through the coastal hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inter-district terminal (across the river) during the day, although most, especially eastbound and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" buses that are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to S√£o Jorge do Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, at the Polo Grounds of Canitas Palace.
In addition, smaller leagues and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, follow the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money at the island 's only Stanley Bank opposite the FIC West store .
Pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; you should check with the owners to find out which payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before the islands recover.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, summer is winter there for those in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; temperatures commonly exceed 30 ¬∞C in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but air and moisture tend to clump together and the air becomes colder than the thermometer reads.
The amount of precipitation remains approximately constant throughout the year, and there are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons.
Although a zookeeper is accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals eventually become feral and may be eaten or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (23 m) away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors each year are injured because they are not kept at a safe distance. These animals are large, fierce, and considered dangerous, so they must be given their own space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so try not to take or cook smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of infamous naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans were drowned.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of top leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
Because Auckland is situated between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the sandy beaches allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by baobab trees.
The Tamaki Road beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are often crowded and have a good selection of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main folk beer is known as "Number One", which is not a complex drink, but a fun and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are varied, but New Zealand and Australian wines are most common.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easy to mistake it for mineral water, if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although they are expensive.
Reef trips are a year-round hobby, and reef injuries are rare for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, and heed all signs and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are abundant near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s. Occasionally they can be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Although you will find that other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, can be booked through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include accommodations, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even combined packages that include flights and hotels.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or complete other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site as this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action , you have to get there early to find a campsite near the music .
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stages may be over, some sections of the festival continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing through the ice makes a very loud noise in the most affected cabins.
Saint Petersburg cruises involve spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos often make a concerted effort to keep guests staying longer and spending more money. They often have no windows or clocks, and exit doors are often hard to find.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood while they stay.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness impairs good judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping the gambler sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as on smooth asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to impede your progress in a very short time.
Snowfall, ice storms, condensation, or ice on windshields can cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular hobby among visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to cross-country travel to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach more closely than vehicles where standard equipment provides a better view.
Lions, leopards and tigers are often shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle safari" or "hiking safari" or "hiking") is a long distance walk, lasting an hour or several days.
The Paralympic Games will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations around Japan.
After hosting the 1964 Olympics, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellations remained in place until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will be priced between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen with a typical regular price being around 7,000 yen.
A dryer helps wet clothes dry. Many hotels have a washer and dryer you can borrow, even if it is not in the room.
If the water is too hot, or you don 't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Don 't let the cloth get too hot (as it may shrink or burn in the worst case).
There are different methods of water purification, some more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, while in other areas you have to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying bottled mineral water that is well-sealed and from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter animal pests unknown in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are called pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially money spent on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has some of the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, regularly passing through isolated forested terrain.
If you are used to driving on country roads, you should be aware: there are always steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is important.
Surprisingly, cell phone coverage is better here than in many other areas along the route, such as the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good, and in the province of Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are very popular and apples are cooked in pastries throughout the year while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Folk cakes are often eaten especially with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small, rich pastries, try varieties called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krappchen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry seasoning can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, as there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia to compare.
However, if used without additional terms, the meaning of the term is more likely that the food originated from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of mildly spicy dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddles are supports for two imaginary men hanging on the sides of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the imagination but has safety concerns due to the possibility of two imaginary men interfering with it.
If a rider falls off his horse and his leg becomes stuck in the stirrup, the horse may drag him if he runs too far. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots that have soft, tight-fitting soles and heels.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rails that allow the rider's skin to slide off the saddle if the rider pulls on it while the horse is descending.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.

Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you would not need to make a separate application for a visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money and transactions.
