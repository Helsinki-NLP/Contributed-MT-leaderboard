This not only confirms that dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held belief, but also provides details about the fossil, including its color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were dark brown above and lighter gray below.
The findings provide insight into the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed tip, called a rachis, but have other wing features - barbs and barbules - researchers conclude that the rachis evolved later than the other features.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were used, not for flight, but for temperature control or illumination. The researchers suggest that while this is the case for the younger dinosaur, the specimen indicates the weight of the adult and not the chicken underneath.
Although this is the tail of a dinosaur, the find indicates that the wings of the oldest bird were not smaller, say researchers.

Martelly's fifth CEP term in four years.
Last month the presidential commission decided to replace the CEP as part of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The commission was in response to widespread protests against the Martell regime that began in October.
The violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, the next of which was scheduled for 2011.
At least 60 incidents of iPod malfunction by overheating have been reported, making a total of 6 fires and 4 accidental burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MET) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents, which the company called "non-serious incidents".
The department responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.

And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of an imminent tsunami.
A former policeman in the Philippines has kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong as they traveled by bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza points his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, and at least six are now dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later moved out of the elderly man's apartment, as they needed a more suitable place to live.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and studied medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating paranormal phenomena in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone were administered to an unborn baby, it could help to speed up the development of its lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Ex-Queen. Luna was my first boss. Luna died that night two months ago. She's as beautiful as she is different. She's a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna is as busy as I am...maybe even busier than I am...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 election, those who favored independence increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard's deputy during the 2010 election campaign said she believed Australia would become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared that view, preferring Queen Elizabeth II as the last monarch.
In a split vote, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a democratic country immediately, while 31 percent said Australia should not become a democratic country at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but poor health made it doubtful that he would qualify.
He was still unable to take the pain medication he needed because he had been banned from the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the famous prime number on January 25.
The discovery was confirmed by a team of astronomers and technicians early in February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of earth's water supply as well as the building blocks of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially the Earth, from the collision of comets in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.
He refers to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He is rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a program that the FAA claims could enable airlines to fly shorter routes to save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon pollution.
It uses basic satellite technology in contrast with previous technologies to allow the wind to guide aircraft and provide pilots with accurate information.
No additional transportation is being installed, and the subway will not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking facilities above the stadium.
Fears of a shortage of transportation have increased the pressure to hold the games behind closed doors.
Research published Wednesday in the journal Science reported on the evolution of a species of finch in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the creation of a new species in two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer because of crossbreeding between Darwin's finch, Geospiza, and a cactus.
Gold can be shaped into almost any desired shape.
It can be drawn into thin strips that can be bent and twisted, pounded with a hammer, and rolled into shape.
It could be softened so that it would adhere to the metal, and it could be softened so that it could sometimes be used to decorate illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical pH. You can test this by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two ingredients together and, with clean, damp hands, beat the mixture into a ball.
The wetness of your hands interacts with the surface of your hands in a unique way and creates a barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains have been found in a Minoan palace on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in civilized Rome, they were sometimes part of the bathhouse, where men and women bathed.
When you make a long-distance phone call, you are using a satellite.
The central satellite picks up the signal and quickly brings the sheep back down to earth.
Scientists use telescopes because the earth's shadow obscures their view.
It takes a rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or a telescope.
Transportation has changed the world in remarkable ways, not the least of which is its convenience and speed.
He has given us trains, cars, and other means of transportation.
Beneath them are a number of medium-sized predators ranging from rabbits to zebras and even deer.
Finally, there are numerous small cats (including house cats) that prey on small animals, such as insects, rodents, voles, and birds.
The secret of their success is position, a special job title that relieves them of competition.
Lions are social cats, living together in groups called prides.
The number of people with a fever is greater and more significant - about 3 men for every 30 women.
Female lions bond closely with one another, forming a large family unit made up of both males and females.
A pride of lions acts like a pack of wolves, or hyenas, animals that are similar to lions (but not big cats) in behavior, and they kill their prey.
A complete runner runs a marathon in which he climbs (or skims), swims, runs a long distance, and throws with five times the force of a man.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
A leopard's roar is not as loud as a lion's, but it is no less ferocious.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when available.
Scientists believe that feral cats track prey by using their sense of smell to locate prey.
Ocelots hunt by hiding in their surroundings and growling to catch their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population) becomes separated from its parent group (as when they cross a mountain or a river, or migrate to another island where they cannot easily return) they usually end up in a different environment than the one they came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need new resources to be more competitive than it was in the past.
The population has not changed, but the adjustment is the same.
Then, as the new generation adjusts to its new environment, it begins to look different.
In time, thousands or even millions of years from now, the populations of these two groups will likely be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation - the development of a new species - and it is an inevitable and necessary part of evolution.
Trees take in carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) and produce oxygen (from the air).
Plants use photosynthesis to make food, and they also provide shade.
We use trees to make our homes, we use trees to make our clothes, and we use trees to make most of the food we eat.
Mosasaurs were the most aggressive predators of their time, fearing nothing but mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 teeth, with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that none could survive crossing the road.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue and lived on a diet of crabs, large fish, mosasaurs, and possibly a few spiny lobsters.
It also attacked anything that moved in the water; even a T. rex would have been no match for it.
Although many of their dishes are familiar to us, the Romans had some unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormouses.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women usually ate on couches, the rich preferred to have their meals in comfortable, collective groups.
Ancient Roman food may not have included foods introduced into Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted figs.
Individual Babylonians built temples for hundreds of gods and goddesses that they viewed as household gods.
People brought offerings to these gods, and the priests tried to meet the gods' needs by holding festivals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open sanctuary to which only the priest could enter.
Sometimes towering structures called Ziggurats were built as part of the temple complex.
At the top of this peak was a special sanctuary for these gods.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not necessarily a luxury.
Hebrew family life was often marked by openness.
Women cooked in the open air; shops opened onto the street; stones were used to build houses.
Forests were scarce in the land of Canaan, and wood was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red, who was banished from Iceland for murder.
But beyond his discoveries, Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each of these lands was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
The inscription still exists on the back of the document, but it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" appear at the bottom of the Declaration of Independence page, written upside down.
Although no one knows who originally penned it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, its massive document (about 11 by 10 inches [29 by 4 cm]) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it is possible that the inscribed sign was included as a label.
The Allied landings and ensuing battles brought relief to northern France, but not to the south.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, the French who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon, an invasion of southern France.
Within two weeks, American and French troops had liberated southern France and were on their way to liberating Germany.
A civilization is a shared culture of a large group of people living and working together in a particular place.
Civilization from the Latin civilis, meaning civilization, referring to the Latin civis, meaning population, referring to the city, is in some sense a description of the population of a nation.
Autonomous communities are the oldest in the country. Multiculturalism combines the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, maintaining a long-lasting culture and spreading knowledge in a fair manner.
Simple rituals are disappearing from the pages of history as the world becomes more civilized.
During the American Revolutionary War, the ten states formed a single, unicameral legislature under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress no longer had the power to levy taxes, and as there was no state governor or judges, it depended on federal officials, who were unwilling to cooperate, to enforce its every action.
It also did not have the authority to overrule governmental taxation laws and procedures.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states tolerated the frequent absences of their representatives.
Along with Germany, Italy's national soccer team is the world's second-best, and it won the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, boxing, handball, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are popular throughout the Nordic countries, and Italians compete in international championships and the Olympics.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's group of islands, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The settlement of Taiwan began back in the 15th century when European sailors passed by an island called Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a colony on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, where they introduced a system of local grain production and hired Chinese laborers to work their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the southern and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three sections, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings at the end of the complex have been restored so that visitors can see how they looked in the past.
By 1976, 80 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most popular motion picture format was the 35mm format, which became the standard size of film before analog cameras were replaced.
They are still being made, but more importantly, they have been replaced by modern cameras.
The actual 35-millimeter format is a maze, 36 millimeters long and 24 millimeters high.
This ratio (divided by 12 to get a whole number) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or nearly equal to this ratio.
The third rule, much abused and often ignored, is a simple rule that creates contrast while maintaining the integrity of the photograph.
It states that the effective point of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal lines (see illustration).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united Europe despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
The quest for power has affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the fundamental principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are especially designed for that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the church had been the ultimate authority in Rome, and the lure of power and money made many question its legitimacy.
Immediately after the outbreak of war, Britain began sinking German merchant ships.
The strategy, which has proved successful, is a military and civilian blockade, in violation of international law and international treaties signed over the past two decades.
Britain laid minefields in the world's oceans to prevent any ships from passing through, endangering even civilian ships.
With only a fraction of their number responding, Germany expected a similar response from unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the dominant ideology of the day was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar fate in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own unique system of time-keeping; each dynasty or ruling family had its own.
Within each dynasty, there were provinces, such as the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During the Middle Ages, there were violent struggles between various aristocratic factions for supremacy.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. Thousands died in the struggle for supremacy in Xi'an.
There are as many social and political problems with the metric system as there are with the strict adherence to political ideals and the notion that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
And after the Reformation jobs were opened to all male applicants so that those who wanted to succeed could do so.
Similarly, instead of having rank and file soldiers, the army is now organized by function.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed foreign workers to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was fascinated by the idea of an afterlife beyond this life. He often went to the cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
He built a cave, which stood for a long time, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad becoming a spiritual person.
Resting atop one of the hills to the north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if someone knows that it once existed.
Nothing is visible except the clear blue sky and the surrounding mountains, and very little of the earth's atmosphere can be seen or heard from there.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many built to honor the pharaoh's death.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" The Egyptian necropolis contains numerous pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), numerous tombs, numerous temples, and a giant sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" is in the shape of a V, and the "down bow" is in the shape of a base or a square with no base.
High means that you start at the bowstring and push, and low means that you start at the hook (the part of the bow held in your hand) and pull.
A high-pitched instrument usually produces a soft sound, while a low-pitched instrument produces a loud, sustained tone.
Feel free to write in your own words, but remember that the printed text is there for a purpose and should be treated with respect.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the Queen's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were marched from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, escorted by an army of women.
They were driven back to Paris, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
In one scene, a member of the mob holds up the severed head of a royal guard at Versailles before the horrified Empress.
The cost of the U.S. war effort during the conquest of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay U.S. taxes when they were pressured to hand over part of the costs and interest of unpaid bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street.
Undoubtedly, the major benefits derived from the long colonization of the Philippines include the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand why they were forced to do so.
This dramatic period is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which in turn ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many possible theories, ranging from the development of new technological devices or the testing of the validity of a technology to the human attempt to control a law related to scientific laws and the human reaction to technology.
Many versions of technocentrism share two common assumptions: that technological development follows a path that transcends cultural and political forces, and that technology ultimately "influences" nascent societies, rather than existing ones by association.
For example, someone may point out that the automobile led to the development of roads.
However, the global road network is not economically feasible for the average car, so new construction methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Increased traffic can lead to more accidents, resulting in new technologies for treating injuries.
Romantic themes have had a profound influence on cultural decisions, according to such authors as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Romanticism, with its emphasis on the primacy of the individual over the dictates of a higher power, has influenced much of modern culture.
Just as Paris became known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople came to be regarded as the fashion capital of Europe.
It flourished as a center of trade from about 400 C.E. to 1100 C.E.
Its fortunes began to decline in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices of superior quality to those sold in Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, there was the influence of Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of technological change, Western styles may lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own method of fastening clothing - one that was influenced by the crusades.
Subsistence farming is a type of farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simpler, often organic, system that uses locally available seed stocks and crop rotation or other simple production methods.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel excluded by society's norms and allows them to develop an identity.
Subcultures differ by age, nationality, social class, geography, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish one culture from another may be language, values, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a combination of these.
Members of an ethnic group often mark their membership with distinctive styles and symbols, including clothing, behavior, and language.
One of the most common methods used to highlight the importance of social interaction is to find these children's stories that inappropriately, or out of spite, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, adults restrict contact with other people and grandparents.
Some foster children have been hidden from humans (usually their parents); in some cases abandonment resulted from the parents' inability to accept the child's disability, be it mental or physical.
Children raised in single-parent homes often experience severe abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others were raised in isolation.
When raised by nonhuman animals, a feral child displays characteristics (physical characteristics) that closely resemble those of its foster parent, such as fear or dislike of humans.
Although using a worksheet makes learning easier and more enjoyable, the teacher's role is to help the student develop knowledge and skills.
A teacher's method of supporting students in their studies is not a teaching method but an aid that provides each student with something new, such as learning to use a new computer program or to start a new job.
To help students in this way, the teacher can meet with the students electronically or in person, in other words, the teacher provides the help but using a Microsoft Office application.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are designed to ask, ask to do, and explain what a learner would find difficult to do on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse, and threats.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of nurturing, care, and education - but it happens.
We view the one-child policy as a safe haven for children.
Our social programs should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, quality education, and reliable health care.
The day-care center should provide all necessary services that were not available in the children's previous place of residence.
Social networking involves communicating with others both in public and in private.
The Internet's versatility has led to greater freedom in its use and in its content.
For example, "reading" and "entertainment" are recommended as important to motivate Internet users (James et al., 1995).
"Sharing of content" and "ongoing relationships" were also described as motivators by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they asked people about their feelings about social networking.
Video recording has made it possible to capture in real time the facial expressions of the translator.
In fact, it says that you can tell when someone is lying by his facial expressions.
Olive Sacks, in her paper The President's Speech, showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity correctly.
E-learning enables teachers to help students work together, as if the whole community were learning together.
Over the past two centuries, research has revealed that there are two types of genes: recessive and dominant.
Mutations can add variation to a gene pool, and selection can remove variation from the population.
Prejudice and reform have prevented progress between the two generations.
In the wild, great apes, which have a digestive system similar to ours, cannot easily obtain their amino acids from plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has tragic consequences: depression, malnutrition, and even death.
Vegetables and legumes provide us with quick energy, but grains and legumes are more difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Similarly, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only digestible but also rich in proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "problems" perhaps in a similar way to modern apes.
A sleeping disorder is when someone deliberately awakens you from a deep sleep and causes you to fall back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using an alarm clock that emits a low-pitched sound to keep you awake without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself setting your alarm clock to go off while you are still asleep, you could set it to go off in another part of the house, requiring you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Alternatives to biorhythms include drinking too little fluid (especially water or tea, substances known to stimulate urination) before bedtime, which causes someone to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness that a person can maintain in the face of extreme emotional, physical, and spiritual stress.
The less anxious you are, the better off you will be physically and emotionally.
Anyone can become enlightened, but only if he has self-confidence.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but it also incorporates Mahayana rituals of love and meditation from the Indian tradition of Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Along with Kundalini Yoga the power of Kundalini (enlightenment) is awakened through yogas, breathing exercises, repetitive phrases and visualization.
Through the meditation of various deities, the energy channels are purified, energies are renewed, and a sense of right and wrong is formed.
Germany was a foe during World War II, which led to the alliance of the USSR and the U.S.A. At the end of the war, tensions arose, and political and cultural rivalries developed.
Two years before the end of the war, the Allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to be followed by 40 years of actual warfare, with armies of noncombatants, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish army was in ruins, and the only hope for survival was a united Poland.
However, those plans were abruptly shattered when some 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded Belarus and Ukraine after invading Poland's eastern provinces in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties.
Compared with other modes of transport, shipping is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The navy's purpose was to keep your country moving and at the same time make it difficult for your enemies to move.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States sought to supply the British Empire across the Atlantic Ocean.
In the meantime, German troops, armed with torpedo boats, tried to impede our progress.
If Britain had not intervened, Germany would have lost the war, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient customs and rites made possible the ready supply of milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds in the mountains or in open country, under the care of shepherds, usually boys or young men.
The earliest wagon roads in England date back to at least the 16th century.
Even though carriage roads were generally made of wood, they allowed the horses pulling the chariots to travel at higher speeds while carrying heavier loads than they could on the rough, paved roads.
Railroad ties were originally designed to hold the rails firmly in place, but it was found that they could be made stronger by adding metal to the rails.
This was a common practice, but the field had caused serious damage to the wheels of the wooden chariot.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and by 1767, all railway tracks were made of iron.
Of the earliest known forms of human locomotion, walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
The ancestors of Australopithecus did not walk in a straight line.
Bipedal features have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join an environmental organization, and we can become an agent for reducing future suffering in some way.
However, if we are not to experience temporary relief, we need to identify the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of human advances in science and technology.
After approval by Congress on July 4, a proclamation signed by President John Hancock and Secretaries Charles Thomson was sent to a nearby printery owned by John Dunlap.
That night, from 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and it arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap Codex is the oldest of the 25 Dunlap manuscripts known to exist, and the original copy is now lost.
Today, paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived into modern times.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there is more to birds than dinosaurs.
They have powerful, webbed feet, large paws, and can walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all modern computers are based on the binary numeral system.
A binary number can have either a zero or a one, and these numbers are called binary digits - or fractions, using computer terminology.
Symptoms, such as vomiting, may be so mild that they do not require immediate medical attention.
A good indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for information on first aid for that poison.
Entomologists use the term "mite" to designate this group of insects.
The word comes from an ancient word related to bedbugs, insects that commonly feed on human flesh.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are territorial, often living in nests or in the home of their caretakers.
Throughout the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading cause of disability among youths and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are three times more likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide not to have children, or they may choose not to have children at all.
The couple may decide to have an abortion.
Adoption is a legal process by which a parent relinquishes his or her parental rights to another family.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works by scientific means.
Experimentation is one of the best ways to eliminate uncertainty and allow scientists to make accurate predictions
Naturalists and philosophers paid more attention to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in almost every field of science and logic.
As Greek learning declined, the West found itself increasingly cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Much of the observed variability in physiology and behavior often lies in the presence of internal cycles and products of the biological clock.
Periodic expressions, which are not intrinsic responses, have been documented in nearly all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Living clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue running time even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first major suggestions that DNA is a hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or bacteria, to grow their own DNA into bacteria.
In two experiments, they extracted DNA from the bacteria using high-energy X-rays or from the bacteria's proteins using high-energy X-rays.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the gene involved, and whether the cells involved are germ-line cells or not.

Scientists now estimate that carbon has been removed from the atmosphere and from the environment on which the theory of evolution was based some two billion years ago.
Everyone participates in community activities and uses public transportation. Almost everyone complains about public transportation.
In developed countries, it is not uncommon to hear complaints about the quality of water or the safety of dams.
Why are public transportation systems often criticized, why do they always fail, are transportation engineers at fault, or is something else going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from two locations and the interaction they have with each other.
However, studying traffic can be a challenge because drivers can no longer be relied upon to act in good faith.
Fortunately, the drivers are careful; hence, some cars run smoothly.
To represent flow accurately, a relationship is established between three quantities: (1) flow rate, (2) volume, and (3) velocity.
This network facilitates the planning, construction, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so enables them to evade predators, find food, and reproduce.
Most moths have the advantage of covering their bodies with their wings.
This gives them a wide berth with few places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can flap their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought that they were right, while many others thought the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
That seems reasonable, since the earth does not seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest river, accounting for more than one eighth of the earth's water.

Humans have known about the basic chemical composition of gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since these elements can be found in nature and can easily be mined without the use of special tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
These were in the same state (same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he formulated the theory that transformed them into new matter to form what we see.
Alloys are usually a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, most elements are on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals, and there are other metals, such as gold and silver.
It can also be a compound that includes small amounts of other elements, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillionth of them would fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became man's best friend.
Sadly, modern writing methods have made the pencil obsolete.
People now type messages on a computer screen instead of using a typewriter.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when the next generation arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill, it splits a nucleus and releases some of its energy.
Some atoms do not have nuclei attached to one another, so they tend to break apart under the slightest pressure.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, the outermost layer of which is called the mantle.
The moon's crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and 60 miles [100 km] thick on the far side.
It is smaller at sea level and larger at higher elevations.
There may have been more on each side, making it easier for the lava to climb.
Theories of motivation are designed to find out why people make choices or complain about them.
These beliefs imply that people develop certain needs or desires as they grow older.
These theories focus on what motivates certain people and what in the world influences them to do or not to do certain things.

Often, people's attitudes can change for the worse when those in positions of authority try to dominate those younger in years.
A foreman now finds it difficult to make decisions on unusual matters, to administer discipline, to evaluate performance, to assign duties, and to ensure accountability.
On the other hand, a renegade feels compelled to change everything the group stands for and adopt it as his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This often leads to misunderstandings between management and the team as a whole.
Seeing-eye groups are held in a similarly sophisticated manner to normal groups, but there are significant differences.
Members of the visible group often act as a bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds.
They are often more vigilant than other members of the group, since their groups may meet at different times without the local authorities' knowledge.
The existence of a true "power group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique aspect of a group of workers who meet and communicate using technology.
The "invisible governing body" is the governing body to which all members must render an account.
Why would an organization want you to spend time finding out about it or studying about it?

The link between mental and behavioral disorders continues to fascinate scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, trauma, traumatic brain injury, and tumors affect behavior and alter brain function.
Modern technology allows us to study the brain and its functions in ways that were previously unimaginable.
This provides us with a wealth of information and the means to build and rebuild something that helps us understand the processes in our brain.
Although Al has a strict definition of science fiction, he founded an important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior of matter and the intelligence of machines.
AI research involves the replacement of human brain functions with machine ones.
Examples include directing, planning and organizing, the ability to respond to clients and inquiries, as well as written and verbal.
From such examples, we can learn practical lessons about how to deal with day-to-day problems.
AI is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, as well as in a number of computer programs and video games.
Field trips are another teaching method, and often the teacher takes the children on field trips instead of taking the bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual space tours. Students can explore museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy the beauty of art while sitting in their classrooms.
A virtual field trip is an excellent way to preserve memories and to share them with the class on future trips.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year the website is updated, but the old websites are kept online for safekeeping.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. As students begin to frequently use blogs written in a non-standard grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience often changes that.
Since students are by far the most avid readers of books, authors strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The need to be curious about people made students smarter and more motivated (Toto, 2004).
In the Blog is a tool that promotes collaboration, and encourages students to pass on learning beyond the classroom during regular school hours.
Effective use of blogs "can empower students to think critically and deeply; by commenting online, students can share their thoughts on other people's posts and voice their opinions on specific issues (Ovarec, 2002).
