This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils do not usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feathers are chestnut brown on top and light or carrot-colored on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed main stem - this is called a "feather shaft" - but had other features of feathers, such as feathers and fins, which the researchers inferred may have evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show mature feathers, not juvenile feathers.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the samples show adult feathers, not those of a Tyrannosaurus rex.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of Sagittarius.
The effect the team is looking for could be caused by tidal forces between galactic dark matter and galactic dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a force on the earth, causing tides, the galaxy also exerts a force on the Sagittarius constellation.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in some sort of halo around the galaxy, composed of many small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caverns on Earth, which typically maintain fairly constant temperatures, but they are similar to deep underground caverns", said Glenn Cushing of the USGS Space Geology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a fairly non-technical experience: voters go into a cubicle and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate into an envelope.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
France's electoral law imposes strict rules on the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of the vote, and that no one else has put envelopes in the box except those who have been counted in time and are entitled to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every step of the election process.

Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, said: "There does seem to be harm if journalists publish information such as photos of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the main body responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that it would not comment further, at least until the charges are filed.
It is revealed that the document will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a 10-year military presence in the valley after the deal is signed, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to only five years.
Rangers will closely supervise shooters who participate in the Pest Control Supplement Trial, as the trial will be monitored and its effectiveness will be evaluated.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), the Shooters' Association has recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage management at the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), said the four gunmen selected for the first shooting had undergone comprehensive safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
This is the fifth time in four years that Martelly has been elected to Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The council is Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by the failure of some elections to take place as scheduled, sometimes escalating into violence.
Approximately 60 iPods were reported to have malfunctioned and overheated, resulting in six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had noted 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified the ministry of another 34 accidents caused by overheating, although the company called them "not serious".
The Ministry of Economy and Industry responded by saying that it was "very regrettable" that Apple delayed the release of the report.
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
An ex-police officer in the Philippines has hijacked a tourist bus in the capital, Manila, and taken a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza brandished his M16 rifle and opened fire on the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six hostages are now confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and the elderly) and the Filipino photographers were released early.
The two photographers then substituted for an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and has worked at Auckland Women's State Hospital since 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
His research has shown that administering hormones can accelerate the maturation of a baby's lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Chamorro said: "Luna was the first queen and my first manager. Luna died on the night of the double moon. A night like this is as special as she is.
Dustin Runnels commented: "Luna is as elusive as I am...she may be even more elusive...I love her and miss her...hope she is in a better place".
In a survey of 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of respondents opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the abdication of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agreed that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
The poll was polarized, with 29% of respondents saying Australia should become a republic as soon as possible and 31% saying Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been called into question due to his complaints.
He has been unable to take medication to relieve his pain because the competition prohibits the use of these drugs.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people with different hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of Earth's water and organics, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to understand how planets, and especially the Earth, have formed since comets collided with Earth so long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been governor since the beginning of the year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political rubbish and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NextGen air transportation systems can shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There are no additional vehicles, no overground trains stopping at Wembley, and no parking or transfer facilities on the ground.
The game may be forced to be played behind closed doors without team supporters due to fears of lack of transportation.
On Thursday, a study published in the Journal of Ornithology reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's warbler and the exotic cactus-billed warbler, although it is thought that the process took longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into fine threads for twisting and knitting. It can also be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and because it is so thin, it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity of the chemical.
The pH value is expressed as the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
A lithium ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a lithium atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders until they are mixed, then roll them into a ball with a clean, wet hand.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers to form a shell-like structure.
Nearly every household in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians and Chinese also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were always part of mixed-gender public baths.
If you want to call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
Satellites in space bounce phone calls back almost as soon as they receive them.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
To send a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is to make our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits and antelope to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that feed on much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, where each cat is responsible for a specific job, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most gregarious of the cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult males who are only related, and up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females are often closely related to each other.
The behaviour of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs. The behaviour of these animals is strikingly similar to that of lions (but different from that of other big cats), and these behaviours are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is an all-around athlete, able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump, and pull five times more than a human.
Tigers belong to the same genus as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not as deep as the roar of the lion, but more like an angry word.
Opossums like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch rabbits, snakes, rodents and birds.
Scientists believe that jaguars track and search for prey by scenting and sniffing the tracks of their prey on the ground.
They have strong night vision, can see clearly in the dark, and are stealthy in their movements.
When a small group of organisms (a subpopulation) becomes separated from their original main population (e.g. they cross mountains and rivers, or they reach a new island from which it is impossible to return easily), they usually find that their environment is different from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor than they did before.
The original populations have not changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to new environments, they begin to become less and less similar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will eventually look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "species formation", that is, the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence of evolution, and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants get their nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The tiger was the top predator of its time and was not afraid of anything except its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and a row of upper incisors.
It may have a forked tongue, but we're not sure. Its diet includes seals, large fish, other crustaceans, and even cannibalism.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it.
Although much of the Roman food was familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called the dormouse
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich like to gather for feasts and eat lying on their sides.
Food that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have been part of the ancient Roman diet.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ate turkey.
For every one of their gods had the Babylonians built him a house as the place of his habitation.
People offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests fulfill the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
In the temple courts there were two courts, one at the front and the other at the back. Only the priests were allowed to enter these courts.
Some special pyramid-shaped towers, known as pyramid shrines, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special holy place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life is spent outdoors.
The women cook in the courtyard; the shops are actually open counters facing the street.
There are no large forests in Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Redbeard was banished from Iceland for murder. He sailed west and discovered land, which he named Greenland.
But whether he did or not, Eskimos were already living there.
Although all belong to "Scandinavia", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the Declaration of Independence depicts a treasure on the back.
However, this is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The words are at the bottom of the document and are reversed.
Although no one can be certain who the author is, the large vellum document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) is said to have been rolled up at the time it was written.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 not to fight the invaders but to collaborate with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people (societies) who live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "of the citizens") and is related to both the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city-state"), which also define the size of a society in some way.
The city-state is the predecessor of the nation. Civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down from generation to generation, cultural traces are preserved, and culture can be spread equitably.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not treated as decent civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (of which Congress was the only component).
Congress has no power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judiciary, it must rely on state governments to enforce all laws, which often do not cooperate.
It also does not have the power to overrule tax laws and tariffs between states.
These articles must be amended with the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states are so lax in dealing with the central government that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the north, where Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Japan is often referred to geologically as the Archipelago due to its large number of islands.
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern region of Taiwan and began to change the way the natives produced food and hired Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
In order to give visitors a better idea of the original appearance of the complex, most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size in the late film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been applied to the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, so the format is actually a bit confusing.
Therefore, the width-to-height ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats, such as the APS format family, are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
Often abused and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics and keeping images organized.
It states that the most efficient location for the subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, already rich and powerful, was closely monitored.
Despite the diversity of European languages and customs, Christianity has bound them together for more than a thousand years.
From kings to commoners, its power reaches out in all directions and affects everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund was set up specifically for this purpose.
The centralization of the Church in Rome for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they are living up to their creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom began a naval blockade of Germany.
They cut off vital military and civilian supplies, a strategy that has proven effective despite the fact that such blockades violate universally accepted international law developed over the past two centuries under several international agreements.
British mines in international waters prevented any ships from entering the entire sea, even threatening neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response from its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitudes of most citizens were pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the atrocities of World War I, countries are eager to avoid a repeat.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; each period of China or each ruling family in the world is a distinctive dynasty.
Similarly, the period of successive dynasties was a period of instability for small states. The most famous of these was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period, which was between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, the Lords fought fierce battles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle for supremacy in the luxurious palaces of Xi'an.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state does not belong to a single ruler but to the people.
Moreover, after the revolution, the civil service was opened to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful a chance to shine.
The same is true in the army, where ranking is no longer based on rank, but on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this world. He used to go to meditate in a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light).
The cave itself has not only withstood the test of time, but also provides a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on a hilltop in the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's not easy to find.
Nothing can be seen except the beautiful clear sky and the surrounding mountains. In the cave, there is almost no sight or sound of the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid is an Egyptian masterpiece of the third century B.C. It is one of many large pyramids that pay homage to the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead (also known as the Giza Pyramid Complex) includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large statue of a lion.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "upper bow" symbol resembles the letter V, while the "lower bow" symbol resembles a thumbtack or a missing square at the bottom.
Upward pointing is pushing the bow from the top, and downward pointing is pulling the bow from the bowstring.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger and firmer sound.
Feel free to make your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed notes have musical meaning, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of fairground women.
They returned to Paris by carriage and were surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows completely.
In front of the terrified Queen, a mob once waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The cost of the war waged by US imperialism to conquer the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, which paid for most of their expenses, as well as interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the high profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the background that led to the founding of the Templar Order.
The era in which the events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages.
Technological determinism is a term that covers many schools of thought in practice, including technological determinism, technological necessity, and a strict definition that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and second, that technology in turn has intrinsic "effects" on society that are not constrained by social conditions.
For example, one might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to build a national road network for only a few cars, so new production methods should be developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Higher Volkswagen ownership will also lead to a higher rate of road accidents, which will drive the development of new medical technologies for repairing injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinist coloration. This comes from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, geography-related customs and cultures emerged, which were much better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were in harmony with the place where the society was located.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury goods began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silks and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow cultural exchanges, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own styles.
Subsistence farming is agricultural activity undertaken for the purpose of producing only the food necessary for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses local seeds preserved within the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture. This is still the case today in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and foster a sense of identity among them.
Subcultures may be distinct, given the differences in age, race, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subcultural group often symbolically use distinctive styles of behavior to indicate their membership, including stylish clothing, manners, and profanity.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most commonly used methods is to use the case of a small number of unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, did not grow up with the help of adults.
Such children are referred to as feral children. Some feral children are kept in captivity by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because the parents refuse to accept that the child has a serious mental or physical disability.
The child may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, wolf pups will behave (to the extent that their physical condition allows) very much like the animal, such as showing fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a means of assisting people who are just learning to use a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be done online or offline. In other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, like the paperclip helper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is built into the software to question, prompt and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for and educated against their will.
We believe that the foster system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that their original family lacks.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet add an extra dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying audience responses to websites, Eimear and McDade (1998) also cited "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating factors.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions (facial movements that last a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks points out in his paper The President's Speech that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggests that this ability to understand human behavior may be a skill shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: explicit and implicit.
Mutations add new gene variants, while selection removes variants from the pool of expressed genes.
Variation moves back and forth between the two libraries every generation due to separation and reorganization.
In tropical grasslands, primates have digestive systems similar to humans, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet the needs of primates for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available vegetable source should be protein from leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting this protein unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (chickpeas, egg whites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a lot of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In summary, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the tropical grasslands do today.
Sleep disruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up without being fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while sleeping, move it to the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other circadian-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which are known to promote urination) and forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The degree to which one's mind is calm is the opposite of the degree to which one's body and mind are tense.
The less stress there is, the more positive the life force is.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through the practice of Mahayana Buddhism's universal love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, meditations and visual imagery.
The central activity of Tibetan meditation is the swan. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are purified and the wheel holes are activated, thus reaching the state of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which fostered cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, institutional, procedural, and cultural conflicts drove the two countries apart.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
The war lasted for 40 years and proxy armies fought to the death on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive line had been breached and the only hope left was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's mission has been to ensure that the nation maintains its ability to transport personnel and cargo while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport its personnel and cargo.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, led by U-boats, tried to intercept the shipment.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain as it had conquered other countries in Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eating and using their milk, meat, hair and skin.
Domestic goats are usually raised in herds in the mountains or other grazing areas, and they are often cared for by goatherds (mostly children or adolescents) who resemble the more widely known sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
The British built wagon roads as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn carriages were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to run faster and pull more on the slightly bumpy roads of the day.
Rail pads were introduced at an early stage to fix the rails. However, it was gradually realized that if iron plates were placed on the rails, the rails would be more stable and effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron pieces made the wooden wagon wheels wear worse.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron track appeared.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, were not used to walking upright.
Bipedalism has been found in the fossil record of southern apes from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become environmental activists to reduce future disasters to some extent.
In many cases this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind have made the problem worse.
The handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4 and sent to the John Dunlap Printing House a few blocks away for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed - what is now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of these letters was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the earliest extant versions of the document. The handwritten manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and has survived to the present day, which we call "birds".
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like orangutans.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing binary-encoded information.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and such a number is called a binary digit, or "bit" in computer terminology.
Poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indicator of poison ingestion may be the presence of open containers containing drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label on the poison to get specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this class of insects.
The term is derived from the familiarity with bed bugs, an insect that is well adapted to living as a parasite on humans.
Cheetahs and beetles are nest-dwelling insects adapted to live in the nests or housing of their hosts.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, and the disease has become the leading neurological disorder among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own sake or for the sake of their children.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method can guide most scientific research.
An experiment is an attempt to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. However, an experiment is not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Vulgate.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were universally accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West became detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers often depend to a large extent on the endogenous cycles generated by the biological clock and their existence.
Periodic rhythms are not simply responses to external periodic signals. They have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that continues to cycle freely for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiments are one of the main indications that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Jones used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one labeling the DNA of the phage with radioactive iodine, and one labeling the phage's proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are passed on to the child, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas and come to see the natural scenery, including wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about red gorillas in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns to go to work, and the workplaces of the people they pass on the way are exactly where they left them.
In this dynamic commute, everyone is in some way connected to and supportive of the car-based transportation system.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do the transportation systems cause such complaints? why do they break down every day? is it the incompetence of the transportation engineers? or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to be within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency, which can be roughly expressed mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, relationships are established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to evade predators and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them more small areas to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are also many who hold the opposite opinion; they think that the solar system revolves around the earth, the sun too (and even other stars too).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with some stretches up to 6 miles wide.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the flow of all the rivers in the world into the sea.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed for their sheer scale and superior construction techniques.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the more than 1,000-year-old monuments of their predecessors.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they could be transformed into new matter to make up what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as nickel and cobalt are metals, and elements such as silver and gold are, of course, metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence can hold trillions of atoms.
As a result, the pencil has become popular among many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil's status has declined and it is used less and less.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to touch a pencil.
One can only speculate what will happen to the keyboard when the updated product comes out.
A fission bomb works like this: it takes energy to bring together a nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a bulky cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
The ground beneath the shadow is thinner, and the ground above it is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more shadows, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
At the heart of motivational content theory is the search for factors of identification or interest.
These theories suggest that certain needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to a certain extent into adulthood.
These theories study why some people want to do what they do and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, when managers begin to lead former colleagues, two types of behavior occur. One is that they strive to maintain "intimacy" with team members.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions and has difficulties with discipline, performance evaluation, assigning responsibility, and accountability.
At the other extreme, the person becomes a completely different individual and feels he/she has to change everything the team does and take ownership of the results.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often leads to disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their corresponding offline team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of true "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" refers to the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take an organization so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments of an organization.
Therefore, in the process of working together to overcome obstacles, an organization often brings new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before organizations can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organized learning.
The continuum approach is explained by Wu Angelian (2006) as a methodology that can help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research. Thus, it narrows the scope of the study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors can affect people's behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain as never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction flavor, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence (AI) research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, respond to customer diagnoses and customer issues, and handwriting recognition, voice and facial functions.
All of these have become disciplines in their own right, focusing on solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and some home computer and video game software applications already have AI systems built-in.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution.Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire fine art in the classroom.
Sharing the field trip in a virtual way is also a good way to review the trip and share the experience with the next class.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website about their trip to the state capitol. The website is redesigned every year, but the old version is kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills.Although students often have poor grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the arrival of readers usually changes that.
Students tend to be the most picky readers, so bloggers started working on improving their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more insightful about the world around them".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school curriculum.
"Appropriate use of blogs, 'can make students better analytical and reflective; by actively responding to online material, students can find their own position in the context of other people's articles and be able to present their own point of view on specific issues' (Oravec, 2002)".
Canada's capital, Ottawa, is a glamorous and bilingual city with an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
These are the things that make Ontario the typical Canadian outsider thinks it is.
To the north, the vast areas are sparsely populated, and in some places are uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising set of demographic contrasts: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar, by far the largest island, is a continent unto itself for wildlife.
The smaller islands, most of which are independent countries or belong to France, are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which is practiced in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring will also help (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment; it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed, etc.
When rejecting a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, renaming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading post here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in Morocco.
Shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and various trinkets can be found all around the old city of Medina, but these shops are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east of the country, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is still safe, any travel outside of Goma should be investigated to see if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has subsided.
The city is also a base for trekking Nyiragongo and Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project.
You can visit Goma on a boda-boda. The normal price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs.
Timbuktu is also used as a metaphor for a distant, exotic land because of its relative remoteness.
Today, though Timbuktu's fame has made it a tourist destination and it has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
This is an important stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, supporting different wildlife species.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee.
There are many benefits to purchasing a Wild Card. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region and is a focal point for many visitors.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are like a shimmering bar graph, especially striking in the reflection of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, you can leave the island and head to Kowloon Beach on the other side.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
It was occupied by the British, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial history.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast to Bangladesh and inland India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, there are also some remnants of the huge jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is water/marshland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Pygmy deer living in the area.
There are buses throughout the day from the inter-city bus station across the river, but most buses, especially to the east and Jakhar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, as the buses are often crowded.
In most areas, you can take the comfortable and sturdy Japan Coaster minibus.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River between Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They are semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who make their living from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Indian Province", a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the city's indigenous features and characteristics.
Argentina is known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
The largest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Cañitas racetrack.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions are also held.
For more information on the tournament and how to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equal in value to the British pound sterling.
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, but British or American currency is accepted; please check with the host in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; temperatures often exceed 30 °C (98 °F) in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than it seems: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season": the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, wild animals are wild animals, after all, and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park managers say you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Almost all large animals, such as bison, reindeer, camels, bears and others, are capable of attacking humans, no matter how docile they may seem.
Dozens of tourists are injured each year for not keeping a proper distance.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or scattering odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to sail through the bay.
Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
A peaceful rally in the town led to the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III during the struggle for independence organized by the Umbrella Movement.
Auckland straddles two harbours, so there are plenty of beaches.
North Shore Beach (located within the North Harbour area) is on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and the shores are lined with all kinds of shops.
The main local beer is the "No. 1" beer. Its taste is not complicated, but it is good to drink and refreshing.
You can buy a lot of French wines here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better for long-distance transportation.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "white coffee" is still relatively unfamiliar. Small cups of black coffee are "concentrated coffee", cappuccino cream (not foam) is piled high, and tea is without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but the quality is good.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are very few injuries associated with any of these activities.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear on the beaches and estuaries of the town of 1770 between October and April of each year. Occasionally, they can also be seen at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not in the ocean, but in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and some even offer flights and hotel accommodation.
If you need time to think about whether the price is right or if you need other documents (such as a visa) to get to your destination, they can hold your reservation.
If you need to make any changes or have any requests, you should first contact a travel agent and not the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and the majority of attendees consider this to be an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to see the show up close, get there early and camp near the stage.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some music festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabins, as sailing on the ice can be very noisy for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include sightseeing in the city. Cruise passengers may be exempt from visa requirements (see terms of service for details).
Casinos generally try to make their guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They often offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and stay in the casino.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On a road covered with ice and snow, there is little friction and you can't drive like you can on a smooth asphalt road.
During a snowstorm, the amount of snowfall in a very short time can be enough to trap you.
Snow, sleet, water droplets on the windows or ice may also block the view.
On the other hand, ice and snow are very common in many countries and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Hunting is perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and a highlight of many travelers' itineraries.
The term "safari" is commonly used to refer to a journey overland to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the tropical grasslands.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) tend to prefer to be close to cars, and standard equipment can give a better view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes afraid of people, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking,
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, first in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellations due to the novel coronavirus have not been extended beyond July 2020, when the Games were originally scheduled to take place.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with general admission prices around 7,000 yen.
Even if the room does not have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer a rental service.
If you don't have an iron or you don't like wearing socks, you can use a blower (if you have one).
Be careful not to let your clothes get too hot (this can cause shrinkage and in extreme cases, scorch the clothes).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others for specific contaminants.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are uncommon in their home countries.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, and in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill humans by violence, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to buy duty-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a lot of money by purchasing alcohol and tobacco at special discounts.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, the most challenging driving conditions are between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently passes through remote areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns everywhere.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, with a common speed limit of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the speed limit is more important than other sections.
Surprisingly, though, cell phone service here is much better than many other routes along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
Germany's pastries are good, and Bavarian snacks are even better, similar to their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit snacks are common, and apples are eaten as snacks throughout the year, with cherries and plums available in the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, oranges and other nuts.
If you're in the mood for a tasty snack, try the fruitcake, which is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in different regions.
A curry meal is a dish of herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry meals can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of water used.
Yogurt is commonly used in curries in the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, while coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
There are 17,000 islands in Indonesia, so Indonesian cuisine is just an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of local dishes throughout the country.
However, without further modification, the term often refers to foods native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is available throughout the archipelago, with a variety of dishes that are easy to season, and the main spices that Javanese people like are peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The saddle is suspended on either side of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for the rider, but also pose a safety hazard as the rider's foot may get stuck.
If the rider is thrown from the horse, but there is a foot peg in the saddle, the horse may drag him away while running. To minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear belts and boots with smooth and fairly narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles - especially English saddles - are fitted with a safety buckle that allows the saddle belt to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls back.
Chile's top climbing destination, Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with its variety of granite boulders and cliffs.
The view from the summit is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are constantly breaking new ground on its steep walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes regular skiing and snowboarding, is a very popular sport in which a ski or snowboard is attached to your feet and slides down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many ski enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski freaks", who plan their entire vacation to ski somewhere.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, when Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia in 1861.
Ski Freeride: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski tourism or ski touring.
The activity is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but is not usually practiced in either. Both activities require steeper terrain and harder skis and boots.
Imagine the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
When conditions are good, you can go further than walking - but only in rare cases can you reach the same speed as cross-country skiing on a flat track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Often, traveling through multiple countries means having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
As long as you are in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, a Schengen visa saves you time, money and paperwork by eliminating the need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country.
There is no uniform definition of what processed items are antiques. Some tax authorities define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, and the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although the age of the handicraft is much shorter than that of mass-produced similar products.
Reindeer herding is an important Sami livelihood. The culture surrounding the industry is also important to many people in other professions.
However, even in the traditional sense, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They make a living from fishing, hunting and similar activities and usually keep reindeer as livestock.
Tourism is one of the main sources of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the term "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If you are visiting a country that is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The travel warning only provides a brief summary of the situation on the ground.
The advice given here is often sketchy, general and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that causes destruction, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of severe weather depending on geographic location, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather in their area, which may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "countering hostile environments courses" may reveal the addresses of local companies that offer training.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here and is often deepened by hands-on experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about survival in war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documentation when returning home.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without an indication of gender (X) or to change the documents to match the desired name and gender.
The extent to which these documents are recognized by foreign governments also varies.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, searches at security checkpoints have also become more troublesome.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery are forced to reveal their privacy when they go through the scanner and are unable to protect their dignity.
Offshore current is the rapid return of waves from beaches to the sea, usually at reefs or similar places.
The underwater terrain causes the return flow to be concentrated in several deeper areas, where it may form rapids flowing into deep water.
Most of the deaths are caused by going upstream against the current, and swimming against the current is unlikely to be successful.
Once you get out of the rapids, it's not that hard to swim back.
Try to swim to a place where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted).
The shock of returning home comes faster (the honeymoon period is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe than culture shock.
For travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it is sometimes difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad for a while, you will find that you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding because they know that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
One might not expect that travelers also need patience and understanding on the way back.
For children, the sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts you can see them silently there.
Usually you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here.
The backdrop is a statue of a lion, which is also the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, and the islands have the largest number of bases, with sixteen in use as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic crater was flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula merge into the plateau here and then re-form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which were split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern, or Sentinel Range, is home to Antarctica's highest mountain, Mount Vinson, with its highest peak at 4,892 metres.
Satellite phones may be your only option in remote areas where there is no mobile phone coverage.
In general, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones, because calls can only be made outdoors where the satellite signal is good.
The service is often used for shipping, including yachts and expeditions with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide details on how to connect to this service.
Studying abroad is becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning to spend their gap year.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before going to university without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can substantially improve your chances of returning to your home country to continue your studies.
Usually, tuition fees are charged for participating in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for sailing and is known as the "land of a thousand lakes", with thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and lakes, yachts are not necessary.
The coastal islands and several of the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 78 people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand have a similar situation, but are unique in other ways (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is 1 in 40).
Most typical Baltic cruise ships stay longer in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can have several full days to visit the historic city before returning to the ship to sleep at night.
A separate visa is not required if you are only going ashore on a boat tour (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and the price of the cruise does not include a tour of the city.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and loathing that many people have for other things.
For some, it may be helpful to understand how airplanes work and the procedures for flying if they want to overcome their fear of the unknown or uncontrollable.
Express delivery companies can be highly rewarded for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods or parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and small companies, there are problems.
If they are transporting goods by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The fastest way is to carry it as checked baggage.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for you to fly).
However, it's not cheap: according to rough estimates, business class tickets can cost four times more than regular economy, and 11 times more than first class!
In general, there is no need to look for discounted business or first class tickets to fly directly from A to B.
The airline is well aware that there are some core passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so the airline will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova have been rebuilt.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million. It is the second largest port in Turkey after Istanbul and a busy transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center, surrounded by huge bays and mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and ancient mosques and churches are scattered among wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers, but the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
In the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy a beautiful view of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
In the churchyard, some of the tombs are topped with interesting marble sculptures of monkeys.
It's worth a half-hour stroll through this charming village.
To the north, the romantically charming town of Sintra is easily accessible; it is the land of Lord Byron and is therefore well known to foreigners.
There is a regular bus from Scotturb 403 to Sintra, which stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, the site of the world-famous apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting the site of a huge mass grave, which has immeasurable significance for a large group of people in the world.
Many men and women survived here, and they are still alive today; and many more have relatives who were murdered there, or worked there until they died, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please give this place the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not mark or graffiti buildings to avoid damaging the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand Catalan, and almost everyone understands Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular broadcasts in the metro are only in Catalan, but the automated system makes temporary broadcasts in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is to behave as well as possible and behave like a "bien élevé".
If you show a little basic courtesy, the rudeness of the Parisians will soon disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested with beech, spruce and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimate, soil and altitude, the plant community here is very rich in species and therefore famous in the world.
The area is also home to a variety of animals and birds.
There you can see rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, lynx, owl, lynx, wildcat and lynx, as well as many more common species
Women visiting the monastery must wear skirts that reach their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries will provide a shroud for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, the monks at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow them from the wardrobe at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed every time someone passes by, so the socks may be a bit uncomfortable to wear.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and exclusively on olive oil.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner that is especially popular in summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredients you can find, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns except "Sie" should begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from slang.
This can also make reading easier, although it complicates writing to some extent, as you need to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used as a nominative form.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce, as most words are pronounced and spelled exactly the same
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes according to the following vowels:
Also, make sure that the r and rr are pronounced differently: "caro" means "dear" and "carro" means "two-wheeled chariot".
The grammar of Persian is mostly relatively simple and regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar primer will help you learn more Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
There is no doubt that if you speak a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who know a little Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is so close to Spanish that it doesn't need to be learned in isolation.
Today, most of the pre-modern observatories have been decommissioned and are preserved only as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as severe as it is today in their heyday, observatories were usually built in urban areas or on campuses that were more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Flower viewing, also known as hanami, has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms are a favorite flower.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom parties were held by the Emperor for himself and other members of the Imperial family at the Imperial Palace.
Plants do best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a single plant.
If you are visiting a landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" is also out of the question.
Generally speaking, Singapore is a very safe place and easy to navigate.
But because of the "high tropics" a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with both high temperatures (all year round) and intense sunshine (relatively rare on sunny days).
Several buses also headed north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Please confirm that the bus you are planning to take will enter Hebron and not just the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a holiday.
For example, visit the castles in the Loire and Rhine valleys, or take a cruise to visit the fun cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also mark the route of popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake somewhere outdoors on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it is most likely a pre-Christian ritual celebrating spring and praying for a good harvest.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, and congregations usually flock to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
Originally, animals reached the islands by swimming, flying or floating.
Being far from the mainland, mammals are unable to travel long distances, making giant tortoises the main herbivores of the Colón Islands.
When humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon for a period of time.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less continuously throughout the day.
These areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is generally not a problem, and you can enjoy the starry sky.
Compared to the work culture of Westerners, the Japanese work culture has a clearer and more formal hierarchy.
Suits are standard business attire and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
A harmonious workplace atmosphere is essential, emphasizing team efforts rather than individual achievements.
Employees must have the approval of their superiors when making any decision and must obey their instructions unconditionally.
