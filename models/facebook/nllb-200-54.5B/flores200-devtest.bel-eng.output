Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, it also provides information that you can't usually get from studying fossils, such as about the color and three-dimensional arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and had a pale or reddish-yellow tint on the underside.
This discovery offers new insights into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, the caudal peduncle, but have the secondary features of feathers, the antennae and barbels, the researchers concluded that the caudal peduncle was likely a late evolutionary change compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or draw attention to itself, and the researchers speculated that even though this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, what you see here is not the down of a bird, but the tail of an adult.
The researchers speculate that although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern shows adult plumage, not the down of a chick.

Dr. Tony Moll had discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He once stated in an interview that the new strain "causes considerable concern and anxiety because it has a very high mortality rate".
Dr. Mol believes that a number of patients may have contracted the disease at the hospital, and at least two of those infected were hospital staff.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech affair, with voters locking themselves in a voting booth and taking out a pre-printed sheet of paper with their preferred candidate's name on it and placing it in an envelope.
After the identification of the voter by the officials, the latter puts the envelope in the ballot box and puts his signature in the voter list.
This whole procedure is conducted in strict accordance with the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can confirm that there were no envelopes in the boxes at the time of the start of voting and that no other envelopes (other than those thrown into the ballot box by duly authorized and counted voters) were dropped in.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and in the evening, under strictly supervised procedures, volunteers count the votes.

Hoon has resigned and will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP and Norman Lam MP is expected to take over as Davey's Trade and Industry Minister.
It is scheduled that on 16 February Price and Heun will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cadbeck, 21, were killed in the accident. Cadbeck was driving.
Christopher Schneider will need facial plastic surgery, and Edgar Vogel has been shot in the jaw and arm.
When Ucho held a gun to the head of the fifth soldier, it didn't work, leaving Schneider in constant pain, blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face now partially made of titanium.
Schneider gave testimony from his own country by video link, while he was at a US Navy base.
In addition to competing on Wednesday, Carponeda took part in two more individual races in the championship.
She first took part in the slalom, where she retired from the race in the first race. 36 out of 116 competitors showed the same result.
During her performance in the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in a seated position. Her total time was 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher, Austria's Klaudia Lesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Hungary's Jongi Dani.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers failed to qualify for participation in the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
"We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss tourist and we were able to recover her mobile phone and laptop", said D.K. Arya, deputy inspector general.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutto Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of those named as accused.
The accused appeared in court with their faces covered, police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said.
Even though when the car crashed into the house, there were three people inside, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
While emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT, traffic on the road where the accident happened was temporarily blocked.
He was first admitted to the James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court as she is accused of murdering her son.
She is awaiting charges and trial, and is currently in custody, but as her photographs have been widely published, all eyewitness accounts have been called into question.
While this is common elsewhere in the UK, the legal system works differently in Scotland - the courts consider that publishing photographs can be potentially harmful.
"Journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path when they publish photos etc. of suspects", observes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Office of the High Court, which is in charge of criminal prosecutions, told reporters that at least until the charges are filed, no further comment could be obtained.
According to the information received, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in a way that preserves the borders that existed before the start of the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information received, among other topics covered by the document are the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that following the signing of the agreement, the military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years, while Palestine agrees to only five years.
The shooters who took part in the supplementary program for controlling the spread of animals had to be under the close supervision of rangers, because the program was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia, Inc. recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, implemented under the auspices of the Sport Shooting Association.
Mick Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's Park Conservation and Heritage Division, stated that the four shooters selected to conduct the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in the new Provisional Electoral Council, composed of nine members.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martheia in four years.
The Presidential Commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Provisional Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
To the major anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelly responded with a commission.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by a lack of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, they had information about the 27 accidents that occurred due to the use of the devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it had received notifications from Apple of 34 new cases of overheating, which it defined as "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (at 21:19 GMT on Friday).
Officials from the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of destruction or accidents in the country.
In addition, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of the disaster.
A former Philippine police officer has hijacked a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
An elderly lady needed to go to the bathroom, so photographers were taken hostage in her place.
Liggins followed his father's example and became a physician.
He trained as an obstetrician and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, he began to study the problem of preterm birth in his spare time.
According to his research, administering the hormone speeds up the maturation of embryonic lungs.
According to Xinhua News Agency, government investigators on Wednesday found two so-called "black boxes" - flight data recorders.
Luna was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first extreme queen. She was my first manager. She passed away on the night of the two-month anniversary. That's pretty original, and she was pretty original. Luna was a strong woman", said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked, "Luna was a freak as much as I was... maybe more... love her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a poll of 1,400 people that was conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that, in her opinion, at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of the respondents, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, are of the opinion that this should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and take part in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness raises doubts: he has complained about his health quite a lot.
He was unable to take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
On January 25, a mathematician and professor of computer science at Central Missouri State University, Curtis Cooper, found the largest known prime number.
This discovery by early February was verified by multiple people using different hardware and software and was announced on Tuesday.
It is thought that comets may have brought back to Earth not only organic matter that can form proteins and serve as the source of life, but also water.
Given that comets have collided with the Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the Earth.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor. He signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
"Political babble and nonsense", he dubbed the rumor.
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that with NextGen systems, planes will be able to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radars, it uses satellite technology that allows air traffic controllers to locate planes with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no increase in public transport, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking at ground level, nor intercept parking.
The likelihood of having to play a game behind closed doors without fans of the team increased, because it may well be that there are not enough vehicles.
The formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands is reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to a report by researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of the new species took just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process takes much longer. The emergence of the new species was made possible by crossing the endemic earthworm (Geospiza fortes) with the non-native cactus earthworm (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which is easy to twist and braid, and can also be cut or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that from time to time it was used to decorate the illustrations of books, the so-called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a particular chemical, and you can make this acid-base indicator yourself from the juice of red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH of a test chemical is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (as you know, a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir these two dry powders in circles until they blend into a single mass, then roll them into a ball with wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers and creates this amazing sensation, and it forms a kind of a shell.
Almost every home in Harappa and Mahenjodaro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan-period houses in Greek cities on Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths where men and women bathed together.
You use a satellite to call someone thousands of miles away.
In space, the satellite receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
A rocket was used to send a satellite into space, and scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends and distorts light.
To get a telescope or a satellite into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in profound ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to make travel easier and faster.
He made trains, automobiles, and many other forms of transport possible.
Below are medium-sized cats. Their prey is also medium-sized - they hunt both rabbits and antelope and deer.
In addition to everything, many small cats (including free-ranging pets) catch and eat more numerous small prey - insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is that each is a niche cat with its own function, so it doesn't need to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most social of all cats: they live in large groups known as prides.
A pride may include up to three adult males who are related, as well as up to thirty females and juveniles.
In most cases the females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behaviour of lion prides and packs of wolves or dogs is similar in many ways; the latter may strongly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to their prey.
A tiger can climb (but not as well), jump great distances, swim, and pull with a force five times that of a strong man, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). No other cats, except these four, can roar.
A tiger's roar is more like a sentence of sharp, loud words than the full-throated roar of a lion.
The ocelot eats small animals, including monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds when it can, and almost all of its prey are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing out tracks on the ground.
Their night vision allows them to see in the dark and they move around very confidently, and as ocelots, they hunt by blending into their surroundings and attacking their prey from hiding.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks off from the main population from which they originate (say, when moving across a river or mountain range or when such organisms migrate to a new island, so that coming back will be quite difficult), they often end up in an environment that is significantly different from the place from which they came.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, and to become competitive, a new population will need different traits or adaptations than it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals become less and less like the parent population from which they split.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later, those two populations will look so different that no one would think of them as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which literally means the emergence of a new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome and a crucial step in evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that we breathe, and then they consume the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants cook their food from sunlight through photosynthesis and they also provide shade.
We use plants to make our homes and clothes, we eat mostly plants, and animals can't survive without plants either.
For its time, Mosasaurs were superpredators, so they feared nothing and no one but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws boasted over 70 razor-sharp teeth and there was an extra row at the top of its mouth which meant that its prey would never be able to escape.
It is not known for sure, but it is possible that it had a forked tongue, and that its diet consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs.
Besides, it pounced on anything that got into the water; its tray was not worthy of even such a giant as T. rex.
While most of their food would not surprise us, some of their dishes were unusual, to say the least, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent known as the nuthatch.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men held banquets where they ate and slept on chairs.
Ancient Roman cooking could not have included foods that came to Europe later from the Americas or Asia.
In particular, they had no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever had the opportunity to taste a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple that served as their home.
Believers brought sacrifices to their gods, and priests tried to satisfy their needs by holding feasts and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had an inner courtyard with an outer courtyard for the priests to enter.
In some cases, temples were built with special pyramid-shaped towers known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
For the most part, Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked outdoors; shops were simply open-air stalls that faced the street; houses were built of stone.
Canaan lacked extensive forests, so wood was highly valued.
Greenland was not densely populated, and according to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he sailed west, he came across Greenland, which he called the Greenland.
But whatever his discoveries, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you saw the movie "A National Treasure", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
But that's not true, because while there is something written on the back of this document, it's not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the back, it says, "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776", and it's upside down at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows for sure, but what is known is that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) in the early part of its existence was rolled up for preservation.
So it's quite possible that it was put there just as a reminder.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south of the country was still under occupation.
It was ruled by the Vichyists, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began - the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they headed towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people working and living together in society.
The aforementioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., "civil". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civis, i.e., "citizen", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city-state". All of this, in turn, says something one way or another about the size of a society.
City-states are the building blocks of nations, and a civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, an equitable distribution, and a sustainable cultural footprint.
It's not uncommon for small cultures not to be considered civilizations in the true sense of the word because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, a government consisting of only a Congress.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since a national executive and judiciary did not exist, it relied on enforcing all laws with the support of government agencies that were often uncooperative.
In addition, it lacked the power to override state tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles of Confederation required the unanimous consent of the states for any change to be made, and the states took the central government so lightly that it was not uncommon for their representatives to be absent.
Italy's national football team, like Germany's, is the second strongest in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing are among the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians also taking part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the world's seventh largest island.
Japan is often called an "archipelago" in terms of geography because it is a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when its name was recorded by passing European sailors as "Formosa" - meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive farming practices, employing Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized western and northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over the island to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main sites: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order for tourists to get a better idea of what most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked like, the latter were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered, and restoration work continues today.
So, the world's most popular format of photographs for still frames is the 35 mm format. On the eve of the era of analog photography, this film format prevailed.
This type of film is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is now used in the matrix formats of digital cameras.
This can be a little confusing, but the 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, it is believed that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats have the same or similar aspect ratios (for example, the APS format family).
Often attacked and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is simple advice for providing dynamism while still maintaining a degree of order in an image.
According to him, the best place to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph in the vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny.
For all the linguistic and cultural differences, the Christian faith held Europe together for more than a thousand years.
Everyone, from the king to the commoner, was under her all-pervading rule.
It is the essence of one of the central tenets of Christianity that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering, and that the church treasury exists for this very purpose.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the dogma is true.
Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
Embargoes on vital military and civilian goods, while violating generally recognized international law and having been enshrined in law by several international treaties over the past two centuries, have proven to be an effective strategy.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, thereby endangering even neutral shipping.
Due to the fact that there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany thought that it would not be limited to unrestricted underwater warfare either.
Among most citizens and countries during the 1920s prevailed sentiments of pacifism and isolationism.
States and peoples were determined to avoid such a situation in the future, having already witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York.
Just four cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
Ancient China had its own unique way of referring to different eras, and each era or dynasty had its own distinct dynasty.
In addition, the dynastic periods were punctuated by periods of disunited provinces when there was instability, the most famous of which was the 60 year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, the many nobles who fought for the throne fought among themselves mercilessly.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the period of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died while fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political effects, including the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the rise of nationalism, and the idea that the country belonged not to a single ruler but to the people.
In addition, various posts after the Revolution were made available to all male candidates, with the result that the most successful and ambitious made their way to the top.
In the army the same thing happened, because if earlier military ranks were assigned, proceeding from the estate, now - on the basis of skills and abilities.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcended mundane life, and he often visited a cave on Mount Nur (translated as "light"), known as "Hira", for meditation and contemplation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, is one of the most striking glimpses into Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world - it is on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if anyone knows of its existence.
Aside from a clear sky above and lots of mountains around you, there's very little of this world to see or hear from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, one of many pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh, was built in the third century B.C.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Death Valley, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs to the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The sign indicating the bow's movement upwards looks like a "V" and downwards looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom side.
"Upstroke" means to start at the end of the bow and go up, and "downstroke" means to start at the peg (where your hand is holding the bow) and go down.
A bow's upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while its downstroke produces a stronger and more confident sound.
You can write your marks in pencil, but remember that the printed symbols for the bow are there for a musical reason, so you should usually save them.
On 6 October 1789, frightened by the crowd of women from the market, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse), and Madame Élisabeth, the king's sister, had to return from Versailles to Paris.
The royal family was driven to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage, and as they drove, they were surrounded by a crowd of people who were whistling and wailing and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage under the pressure of the crowd.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved to the queen, who was already scared to death, the head of a guard killed at Versailles.
The U.S. imperialists' military expenses incurred in the conquest of the Philippines were to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay for much of the costs and interest on the bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the greatest achievement of the U.S. imperialists would have been the super profits generated by the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To get a sense of who the Knights Templar were, you need to understand the preconditions for their creation.
Traditionally, the era when these events took place is referred to as the Classical Middle Ages - the period of European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
It was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, the latter of which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" refers to a range of practical ideas, from the emphasis on advancing certain technologies or technological necessity to the notion that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based and their embodiment in technology.
Two general ideas characterize most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technologies is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technologies, in turn, make their own (rather than socially determined) impacts on society.
In particular, it is believed that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of cars is small, a nationwide highway network does not make economic sense. For this reason, new modes of production are being developed that will reduce the cost of car ownership.
Increased car ownership is leading to more accidents, which in turn is leading to more medical advances in treating many types of injuries.
A strong element of cultural determinism, influenced by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When it comes to the Romantic era, people were heavily influenced by their geography, and as time went on, there were traditions and culture around it that were better than arbitrary laws, because they were in harmony with the place and the situation of the society.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gains fame as an epicenter of luxury and retains this status almost until 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status as the capital of luxury grew, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts of spices and silks at a much higher price than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople gave up the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style came between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the Eastern Byzantine culture had a strong influence on the style of clothing.
However, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind because of slow communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own distinctive style towards the end of the Middle Ages, and one of the biggest things that happened was that people, as a result of the Crusades, started to use buttons to button their clothes.
Subsistence farming produces enough food just to feed the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple and generally organic system based on the use of ecologically appropriate, locally stored seeds combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Many farmers have historically practiced subsistence farming and still do in many third world countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members may be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a distinct subculture may be based on a variety of factors - linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination thereof.
Members of the same subculture often identify themselves by a distinctive and symbolic style of dress, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most commonly cited illustrations of what socialization is and how important it is comes from children who were unfortunate enough to be neglected or abused and who were not socialized as children by adults.
Some "wild" children were kept in captivity for long periods of time (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care was the result of a reluctance on the part of the parents to notice serious physical or intellectual disabilities and defects in the child.
Before being abandoned or running away, bullied children may have been severely abused or traumatized.
Others appear to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild.
When a child is entirely raised by an animal, his behavior almost invariably (given his physical limitations) mirrors that of the animal caretaker: for example, such a child may be fearful of people or indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather an adjunct to help people gain learning experience, which may mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be physical or virtual, and the assistant is the teacher and a little bit of Microsoft Office, for example.
The software is designed to allow virtual assistants to ask questions, give hints, and explain procedures that a student or listener would not be able to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, ranging from abuse to neglect to coercion.
Children can't be allowed to grow up in environments where they're not cared for, nurtured, educated, and yet this happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe space for these kids.
And the assumption is that through our foster care system, our foster children will have good health care, safe homes, kind and caring caregivers, and a stable education.
The idea is that the foster family is supposed to provide for all the needs of the child that were not met in the home they were taken from.
The Internet is not only a tool for mass communication, but also for interpersonal communication.
Due to the special characteristics of the Internet are additional possibilities for its use and meet the needs of the audience.
Thus, for example, it is suggested that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are important motives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "persistent relationship" were also identified by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new dimensions of motivation when studying audience reaction to Internet sites.
The video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial muscle movements that last only a few milliseconds.
The claim is, among other things, that correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
And Oliver Sacks looked at this in "The President's Speech", and he looked at how people who have brain damage, without understanding speech itself, can still accurately judge sincerity through images.
He even speculates that animals -- like domestic dogs -- may also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
Research throughout the 20th century has suggested that there are two foundations of genetic variation, namely, explicit and implicit variation.
Mutation creates new genetic variations, and selective breeding removes them from the gene pool.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination mix the variations in these two pools.
In the savannah, the available plant resources cannot meet the amino acid needs of primates when their digestive system is similar to ours.
What's more, if they fail to do so, the consequences are serious, including malnutrition, stunted growth, and inevitable death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in legumes and leaves, but if not cooked properly, they can be difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of proteins, rich in all essential amino acids and at the same time easily digestible.
It's not surprising, then, that it turns out that our ancestors solved their own protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate waking up of a sleeping person during normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
And you can do that with a relatively quiet alarm clock, which will wake you up but not completely.
If you find yourself doing this in your sleep, try putting the clock in a different part of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on biorhythms, before going to bed it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (primarily water or tea, the famous diuretic) - this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
The inner calmness of a person is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force is. Absolute calmness and contentment are within everyone's reach.
Enlightenment is within the reach of everyone, and the only obstacle is our own negativity and our own stress.
At the heart of Tibetan Buddhism is the teaching of the Buddha, which was supplemented by the way of Mahayana love and a number of techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all of humanity.
Followers of Kundalini yoga believe that certain yoga poses, mantras, visualizations, and breathing exercises can be used to awaken the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment).
Divine yoga is a major part of the Tibetan meditation practice, and the visualization of various deities helps to clear the energy channels, open the chakras, and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led the USSR and the United States to cooperate. After the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to friction between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins - former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was really fought by friendly armies, and the battlefields were all over the place -- from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by 17 September 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, in just one night these plans lost their meaning, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers as part of the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Cargo shipping by ship is obviously the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of navies was to ensure that their country was able to move people and goods, and at the same time the enemy would not be able to move their people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II was one of the most significant examples of this idea, as Americans sought to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this movement, using mainly submarines.
Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well in the same way as it had conquered the rest of Europe, if the Allies had failed.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats usually grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often tended by child or adolescent shepherds known as kazapos.
As early as the 16th century, England had horse-drawn carriages.
Although carriage roads were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to travel at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on existing rough roads.
Sleepers were used to hold the rails in place quite early; however, after some time it was realised that movement along the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the cars wore out faster.
The first all-metal rails appeared in 1767.
Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus -- meaning "man who walks upright" -- humans began to walk upright.
Australopithecus, their predecessors, generally did not walk upright.
Walking Australopithecus individuals have been found in fossils that are 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, but it is possible that the coelenthropus was already bipedal seven million years ago.
You can become more environmentally aware, you can become part of the environmental movement, you can even become an activist so that the future that I just mentioned is not a future of so much suffering.
Often, this looks more like symptomatic treatment, but while we need more than a stopgap solution, we need to address the root causes.
There's no doubt that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity's technological and scientific advances, and we can see the problems that overpopulation and people's wasteful lifestyles are causing.
After the Declaration was passed by Congress on July 4, its handwritten copy, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to John Dunlop's printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlop Sheets".
On July 8, John Nixon for the first time publicly read this document in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9.
Twenty-five first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) survive; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
And many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive, and that they even exist today, but we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, most people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But birds still share a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs, and, like T. rex, they walk on their two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers operate on information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can contain only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may have no obvious symptoms. For example, heartburn is a fairly common symptom, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The first sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of pills or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions for emergency medical care for this particular poison should be consulted on the label.
To designate this group of insects, entomologists use the term "clover" in a formal sense.
The term "bed bug" arose because people have long recognized that bed bugs are highly adapted parasites on humans.
Both kissing bugs and bed bugs are nest parasites, having become accustomed to living in nests or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
A study found that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
The couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or the best interests of the child they already have.
Couples who don't know each other may give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, the child's natural parents renounce their parental rights so that other spouses can raise the child.
The fundamental purpose of science is to find out, through the scientific method, the way the world works.
There is, however, more to it than that. An experiment (that is, a test conducted to rule out one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also guides and stimulates scientific research.
Philosophers and naturalists were especially interested in the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
The conventional wisdom at the time was Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology.
As Greek-speaking populations declined, the West found itself cut off from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms observed in animal behavior and physiology are strongly influenced by the presence of endogenous cycles resulting from the functioning of the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, have been recorded to have periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining process that keeps going even in the absence of external cues in independent, free-running cycles.
One of the basic hypotheses that DNA is the genetic material was tested in the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments in which they used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of a bacteriophage or radioactive sulfur to label a bacteriophage protein.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited; other mutations result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism appeals to those people who have an interest in visiting different natural areas and territories, as they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including enjoying the observation of flora and fauna.
Some examples of things to do in nature are fishing, hunting, birding, visiting parks and exploring ecosystems.
For example, visiting, studying and photographing orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People in small provincial towns drive out of their cars every morning to go to work, passing other people on the road who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic traffic cycle, everyone is somehow involved in and supportive of the car-based transport system.
The evidence shows that our modern high-carbon economy has upset the stability of the biosphere, which has powered human evolution for the last two million years.
Transportation systems are used by all the people who participate in society, and almost all of them are not happy with them.
In the developed world, you hardly hear so many complaints about collapsed bridges or water quality.
Why are our transportation systems such a constant source of these types of complaints, why do they regularly break down, is it that transportation engineers are not competent enough, or is there something more going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is a complex problem because there's no way to predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite sequentially; therefore, usually, traffic flows are characterized by some rationally determined sequence and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To more fully and qualitatively show what is the movement of vehicles, it was established as related to each other three of its main parameters: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Having these connections helps with the planning and design of road facilities, as well as their maintenance.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose ability to fly helped them better avoid predators, as well as find mates and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects are folded along the body.
This allows them to squeeze into all sorts of small spaces to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
There was a guy named Aristarchus a few thousand years ago who proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
While some believed that he was correct, many held a different view - that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
That sounds smart, because if you're on the Earth, you can't really see it moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on Earth and the largest, with eight times the volume of the next-largest river.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes up to six miles wide.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the world's oceans from rivers.
The Amazon River, which is fed by thousands of smaller rivers, is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although stone-building of the pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in scale and technical sophistication.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom revered the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City is home to only about 800 people, making it the world's smallest independent state with the smallest population.
In the legislation and official communications of the Vatican, Italian is used.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as a daily language, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All inhabitants of Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Since basic elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur naturally and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, they have been known since prehistoric times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that stated that all things were composed of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like there were four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although his theory said they could transform into other matter and eventually become what we observe.
Most alloys are a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many more elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain trace amounts of non-metallic components, such as carbon.
Matter is what everything in the universe is made of. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
And atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence can hold trillions of them.
And as a result, when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and the frequency of its use declined as new writing techniques were developed.
People are typing messages on computer screens now, and you don't need a sharpener.
We can only guess what fate the keyboard will meet when it is replaced by something that is fundamentally new.
A plutonium bomb works by harnessing the energy of nuclear fusion, which creates a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a very heavy cart up a hill, some of that energy will be released by the re-fission of the nucleus.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no external force.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side about 100 km.
Beneath the lunar mare, the Moon's crust is thinner, and beneath the highlands, it is thicker.
The lunar maria may be longer on the near side of the moon because here the crust is thinner, and consequently the lava was easier to rise to the surface.
Good theories focus on what drives people or what motivates people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires which they internalize and which become subjective (i.e., internalized) during adulthood.
All of these theories describe what makes individuals desire what they do and what factors in their environment can influence whether they will do these things.
Maslow's "hierarchy of needs" and Herzberg's "two-factor theory" are two authoritative theories of meaning.
Essentially, when managers supervise their former colleagues, there are two types of behaviors that can occur: On one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "their boyfriend" (or "their girlfriend").
A manager of this type may have difficulty evaluating performance, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, assigning responsibility, and holding accountable those responsible.
At the other extreme, you're changing beyond recognition, and you feel like you have to change everything that the team has been doing, and take ownership of it.
At the end of the day, it's the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this kind of behavior results in arguments between leaders and team members.
The same standards of excellence for physical teams must apply to virtual teams, but there are subtle differences.
Typically, virtual team members act as a contact center for their corresponding real group.
Given that such teams can meet across time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, something that may be incomprehensible to local leaders.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of managers that each member reports to is called the "invisible team". It sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of becoming a learning organization? Innovation is one of the purposes of applying organizational learning concepts.
Creativity and ingenuity can occur when, across functional departments of an organization, all available resources are used effectively.
So the process that an organization uses when people are trying to collectively overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for meeting customer needs.
The leadership of an organization needs to create a culture that is characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning, only then can an organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), the continuum approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to studying cognition is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data, thus narrowing the field of study and making it more precise.
Researchers have found a strong correlation between brain disorders and behavior.
We've known for a long time that various types of traumatic brain injuries -- lesions, growths, plaques, lesions and tumors in the brain -- affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
Advances in new technologies are making it possible to explore the very structure of the brain and its previously unknown processes.
So now we have a huge amount of material and data available to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" is usually associated with science fiction, AI is actually a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the study of behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of computers.
Artificial intelligence research involves trying to make machines automate tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
Examples include planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical issues, and face, voice and handwriting recognition.
They have emerged as a set of disciplines that look at real-life problems and offer solutions to them.
Today, AI is used extensively in economics, medicine, technology, and the military, and is a software component in some computer applications and video games.
Field trips are an important part of the school curriculum, and teachers often take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology makes it possible for students to take virtual field trips so they can explore museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or marvel at the beauty of art, all from the comfort of the classroom.
Sharing virtual tours is also a great way to reflect on your trip and share your experiences in future activities.
For example, the students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capitol, and every year they redesign it, but the old versions remain on the web as an album.
Blogging can also improve students' written language, while grammar and spelling can sometimes be "crippled" at the beginning of blogging, this usually improves due to the audience.
Considering that students are usually the most picky audience, the author of the blog, in order to avoid criticism, does everything possible to improve his style.
Besides this, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them". The need to keep the audience engaged inspires and compels them to remain competent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional classroom approach offers.
If students use blogs appropriately, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; actively reacting to Internet material will help students to formulate their own position on what is written by others, as well as express their own views on particular issues" (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, the fun and charming bilingual capital of Canada, is home to numerous art galleries and museums that offer a window into the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and to the north is Muskoka Lake, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
For this and many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other outsiders consider Ontario to be typical of Canada.
Large parts of its territory further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited desert.
For population comparisons, here's a fact that will surprise many people: there are more African Americans in the United States than there are total citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, of course, the largest of these, and it's the size of a continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or part of France and are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, European influence and colonialism began.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are advised to always say they are married, even if they are not.
In addition, it may be useful to wear a ring (such that it does not look too expensive).
They need to be aware that as a result of cultural differences, they may encounter behaviours that they may find unwelcome, such as local people may harass tourists, shake hands and so on.
Say "no" firmly to men and stand up for yourself (this is totally unacceptable despite cultural differences!).
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and later rebuilt it as Casa Branca (White House) and abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and renamed it Daru el-Badja. The name Casablanca comes from the Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Near the Old City of the Medina, you can quickly find places selling traditional Moroccan products - leather goods, pottery, tajines, hookahs and various toys, but they are all intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano swept through Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially in the downtown area.
Although the city of Goma itself is safe enough to go outside, it is worth doing a little investigation to know if there are fighting at any given moment in the province of North Kivu.
The town also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers very cheap services for mountain gorilla watching enthusiasts - more attractive prices in Africa are hard to find.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's relative inaccessibility, its name came to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic locations.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport, Timbuktu today is a city of poverty.
In 1990, it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to threats from the desert sands.
Henry Louis Gates devoted much of his PBS series "The Wonders of Africa" to the city.
Compared to the rest of the country, the city even more stands out because it has more Arabic than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. To the east it borders Mozambique, to the north Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and contains 14 ecoregions, each with different animals and plants.
It represents one of the most interesting places of the country and is also considered the most significant of South Africa's National Parks.
Like all national parks in South Africa, there is a daily entrance fee and an environmental fee.
In addition, the purchase of the so-called Wild Card - a subscription that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all national parks of South Africa - can be profitable.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from Hong Kong Island, which is the center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings that shape the city's architectural face are set against a glittering bar graph, and the waters of Victoria Harbour accentuate its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be had by leaving the island and heading to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on drained land.
This area was colonized by Great Britain in the past, so if you want to see evidence of the country's colonial past, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline deep into Bangladesh and the interior of India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The name "Sundarbans National Park" is the name of the part of the forest that is located in India.
It's not just the mangroves that are called forests, it's also some of the last remaining virgin jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which reservoirs or wetlands cover about one-third.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are reportedly found in the region.
From the inter-district bus station (which is across the river) buses depart throughout the day; however, in most cases they depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakhar (which is in Bumthang district).
Due to the fact that inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy tickets a couple of days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable small Japanese-made Coaster buses serve most areas.
Shuttle taxis are a comfortable and convenient way to get to places nearby - for example, to the cities of Punakha (fare - 200 NGT) and Paro (fare - 150 NGT).
The bridge over the Ayapock is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the banks of the Ayapock River between the cities of Ayapock (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Luapock (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, the roadway consists of two lanes, each with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017, although its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led the life of semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous people who inhabited the territory of present-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups in the Chaco region, such as the Payagua and Guaycura, survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", actually came into being in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors met indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a 300-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its distinctiveness and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the polo grounds of Las Cañitas host the biggest tournament of the year.
At other times of the year, smaller-scale tournaments and matches are held.
Information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
In the Falkland Islands, currency can only be exchanged at the country's only bank, located in Port Stanley opposite FIC West.
As a rule, anywhere on the islands British pounds are accepted as payment. In addition, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley itself.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British or American cash may be accepted; ask the owners in advance what their payment method is.
It is virtually impossible to exchange local currency outside the Falkland Islands, so do so before you leave.
When it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, and vice versa, because it's south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above 30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer bar rarely dips below freezing, but winds combined with humidity make the temperature seem lower than it actually is.
Precipitation is almost constant throughout the year, so there are no distinct rainy or dry seasons.
While many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of humans, there is no need to feed or disturb them - wild animals remain wild.
The park advises keeping at least 100 yards (meters) away from bears and wolves and 25 yards (meters) away from other wildlife!
Bison, moose, antelope, bears and almost all large animals are capable of going on the attack, no matter how docile they may seem.
Dozens of visitors each year are injured due to a lack of proper distancing. Do not get too close because these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing food with strong flavors, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city of just under 40,000 people is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia has existed since the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 the harbour became the site of an infamous naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbour.
With the exception of one British cruiser, all the other ships sank, resulting in nearly 200 American and German deaths.
The assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Leolofi III ended a peaceful assembly in the city held during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
Due to the harbour on both sides of Auckland, there are a large number of beaches. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches are located near North Harbour and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south along the Pacific coast.
Most of the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and most have some shade from trees.
In the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers (the central area of Auckland) in the harbour of Waitematā are the beaches of Tamaki Drive.
This is another time crowded beaches for families with lots of shops. Swimming here is safe.
The main local beer is known to customers as "Number One". This drink is simple, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is "Manta".
You can try a variety of French wines, but your trip should include wines from Australia and New Zealand.
The local tap water is perfectly safe and drinkable, but if you have any concerns, bottled water is not a problem.
Australians are unfamiliar with the idea of a flat white -- a small shot of espresso, black coffee, a cappuccino with cream instead of foam, and tea brewed without milk.
The hot chocolate is exactly the same as in Belgium. The fruit juices are quite expensive, but the taste is great.
Travel to the reef occurs year-round and in great numbers, but injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Still, we encourage you to follow the advice of the authorities, to follow any recommendations, and to listen carefully to any safety warnings.
The box jellyfish are found from October to April near the beaches and estuaries north of 1770 and occasionally seen outside this period.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks stay away from people to avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles mostly live not in the ocean, but in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, since he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agent.
Usually, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport pick-up and drop-off or even combined packages with airfare and hotel accommodation.
Additionally, if you need time to think about the offer or obtain any other documents (such as a visa) that are necessary to get to your destination, the travel agent may hold your booking.
It is recommended that you send your suggestions for changes or requests to the travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of people who go to music festivals choose to stay, and the vast majority of people who go say it's an incredibly enriching experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a campsite near the bandstand.
Please be aware that even if the main stages are closed, there may still be festival locations with music playing well into the night.
At some festivals, families with small children can use special campsites.
It is advisable to check the location of your cabin when crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter - the passage through the ice can be accompanied by a terrible noise and crackling, to which people with heightened sensory sensitivity are particularly sensitive.
The program of cruises to St. Petersburg includes spending time in the city. Passengers of these cruises do not need a visa (read the terms).
A typical casino goes to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible in a building with no windows, no clocks, and no easy way out.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks and entertainment programs, all designed to keep guests in a good mood and not wanting to leave.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the establishment's expense. However, all good players know the importance of maintaining sobriety, as intoxication interferes with clear thinking.
Snow, ice, and freezing temperatures must be considered by anyone who plans to visit northern latitudes or cross mountain passes.
The coefficient of friction on snow- and ice-covered roads is low, so you can't drive as if there's asphalt beneath your wheels.
A snowstorm can pack so much snow in a very short time that you get stuck.
In addition, visibility may be limited due to snowfall or blizzard or frost or condensation of moisture on the windows of the car.
At the same time, snowy weather and glaciation are common for many countries and transportation is not interrupted throughout the year.
The most popular tourist attraction in Africa is probably the safari, and for many visitors it is the highlight of the trip.
In common parlance, the term "safari" refers to a journey overland, specifically across the savannah, to see the beautiful African wilderness.
Individual animals, such as giraffes and elephants, tend to come close to vehicles, and even standard equipment can provide good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are easier to see with binoculars, because they tend to be very cautious at times.
A hike that takes a few hours or even a few days is called a walking safari. It is also known as bushwalking, trekking safari or hiking.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with individual competitions being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice - the first time was in 1964.
Things can get tricky if you've booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before we even knew about the carryover.
The cancellation policy may vary, however, as of late March, the cancellation policy due to the coronavirus outbreak does not cover July 2020, when the Olympics are due to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
If you ask to iron wet clothes, they will dry faster, and many hotels will lend you an ironing board and an iron even if they are not in your room.
You can try using a hair dryer if you don't have an iron handy or don't want to wear ironed socks.
Try not to heat the fabric too much (which can shrink it or even burn it).
Water can be purified in a variety of ways, some of which are more effective against particular threats.
In some places, you can boil water for as little as a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you're in any doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests uncharacteristic of their native region.
Pests are capable of causing irritation (and in the worst cases even allergic reactions), spreading toxins and infections, and spoiling food.
Usually, the category of pests does not include infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that are capable of injuring or killing a person.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Tourists who go to countries with very high taxes can often save a lot, especially on products such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway are between Point Marion and Fairmont, where there is often no through traffic.
If you don't have much experience driving on country roads, always stay alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and unexpected turns.
The existing speed limits here are significantly lower than the fore and aft sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is very important to adhere to them strictly.
Interestingly, the cell signal is much stronger here than along many other sections of the trail, such as near the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries in Germany are quite good, and in Bavaria, like in its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite hearty and varied.
Fruit flour products are widespread, to which apples are added all year round, and in summer, in addition, cherries and plums.
Many German pastries contain hazelnuts, almonds and other hazelnuts. Often strong coffee is a good partner for popular cakes.
If you are looking for a small but high-calorie pastry, try the one called Berliner, Pankochen or Krappen, depending on the locality.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables that is seasoned with herbs and spices.
There are two types of crust. It can be dry or wet, depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to the crust, while in southern India and some other coastal areas, coconut milk is simply added.
Indonesian food is cooked on the 17,000 islands. Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, in the absence of further clarification, the term most often refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine can be enjoyed throughout the archipelago, with a wide variety of unpretentious spicy dishes, spices and aromatic additives, such as peanuts, red chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups hang on either side of the saddle and are supports for the rider's feet.
They give the rider more stability, but can cause safety problems because the rider's legs can get caught.
If the rider falls off the horse, his leg can get caught in the stirrup. In this case, if the horse is startled and starts to run away, it can drag the rider behind it. To minimize the risk of this, some safety measures can be taken.
First, special shoes with heels and a soft, rather narrow sole are worn by most riders.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have protective arches. When the rider pulls back on the saddle strap during a fall, the arches allow him to fall off the saddle.
In the Cachama Valley, Chile's main destination for mountaineering, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are a large number of large granite rocks and obstacles.
The views from mountain peaks are spectacular, and climbers from all over the world are constantly carving new routes through this endless labyrinth of rock.
Skiing and snowboarding, which involve descending a snow-covered surface on skis or snowboards attached to your feet, are very popular.
For many ski enthusiasts, skiing is the main activity of their trip, sometimes called "amateur skiing", as they may spend their entire vacation skiing at a single location.
People have been skiing since ancient times - rock paintings depicting skiers date back to about 5000 BC.
Somewhere in the 17th century, the history of skiing as a sport began, and in 1861 the Norwegians had already opened the first sports and recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: skiing in remote areas, ski touring or ski touring.
It is close to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them. The latter are practiced on steep terrain and require much sturdier skis and footwear.
Compare a ski trail to a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you may be able to cover a little more than if you were walking, but it's rare to reach ski speed on paved roads without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent. Nevertheless, it contains many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling across several countries means that tourists and travellers need to repeatedly pass through passport control and apply for visas.
At the same time, the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this respect.
You are usually able to cross borders without going through passport control again while you are in this zone.
Similarly, if you already have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and simplifying paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax authorities define goods as antiques if they are more than 100 years old.
The term "antique" has some geographical variations; for example, in North America, the age required for an item to qualify as an antique is younger than in Europe.
Handcrafted items may be classified as antiques even though they are less than a year old when compared to similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the trade culture that accompanies it is important for people of other professions.
However, even traditionally large reindeer herding was not practiced by all Sami; many made a living from fishing, hunting or similar activities, and reindeer were used mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami have modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, where Sami live.
Despite its widespread use, especially among other peoples, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions about gypsies.
If travel warnings or travel advisories are issued for a country you are planning to visit, this may affect your travel health insurance conditions or cancellation insurance.
You can also take advice from other countries' governments rather than your own, but their advice is tailored to the citizens of their country.
So, for example, compared to Europeans or Arabs, U.S. citizens may encounter different situations while in the Middle East.
Recommendations and warnings are merely a summary of a country's political circumstances.
They often express general, superficial and simplistic views, especially when contrasted with the more detailed information available from other sources.
Extreme weather is an umbrella term for dangerous weather phenomena capable of causing damage, disrupting public life or leading to human casualties.
Weather can be severe anywhere in the world. Depending on geographical location, relief and atmospheric conditions, natural disasters can take different forms.
Among the various forms and effects of extreme weather are not only strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires, but also tornadoes, cyclones, thunderstorms and waterspouts.
Tornadoes, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms are all regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any possible severe weather conditions in their region, as this will affect their planned trips.
Anyone planning to visit a country where fighting may be taking place would be well advised to undergo training.
Maybe if you do an Internet search for "aggressive environments course" you'll get the address of a local business.
These courses usually provide more detailed information on the topics mentioned here - along with practical experience.
Typically, such a course lasts from 2 to 5 days, and its program includes role-playing games, a lot of training on first aid, as well as on handling weapons.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wild, but there are very few publications about survival in war zones.
Tourists considering gender reassignment surgery abroad should have the proper documents with them when they return home.
Different governments in different countries are willing to issue passports with an undefined gender (X) or to change the documents according to the desired name and gender.
Foreign governments are willing to comply with these documents as well to very varying degrees.
In addition, after September 11, 2001, the surveillance at checkpoints became much more brazen.
It is unreasonable to expect that transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery will be able to pass through the scanner without their dignity and right to privacy being compromised.
A rip current, often seen on a reef or similar place, is the backflow of waves moving away from the beach.
The backflow is concentrated in a few deep areas due to the underwater topology, and there it is possible to form a fast flow to great depth.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue, when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which may not be possible.
Once you're out of the current, it's easy to swim back.
Also, if you're skilled enough or if you've been spotted, you can stay put and wait for rescue.
Because of the shorter honeymoon phase, the shock of returning home can come earlier than the culture shock and can be more severe and last longer.
Travelers who have had no trouble adapting to a new culture may find it very difficult to re-adapt to the culture of their home.
People who return home after living abroad for an extended period of time have become accustomed to the culture of the new country, and they have lost some of the habits they had in their home culture.
Most likely, when you visited a foreign country for the first time, people were patient and tolerant, because they knew that it takes time for you to adapt.
What many people don't expect is that the same understanding and patience is needed for those travelers who are returning home.
One of the activities that your children are likely to enjoy more than anything else is the sound and light show that takes place around the pyramids.
Darkness and silence envelop the pyramids just before the show begins.
The voices of tourists and street vendors are ever-present, and the story of light and sound is like a collection of short stories.
The Sphinx serves as decoration and acts as the narrator of a long story.
The pyramids serve as a screen for the plots of the stories, and different pyramids are highlighted from time to time.
Several nations lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and are home to the largest number of bases, with sixteen still in operation as of 2020.
The archipelago is separated from the Peninsula by a distance of 120 km in a northerly direction. The largest island is called King George, and on it is the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, the islands of Livingston and Deception, where a picturesque natural harbor was formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea, is located south of the peninsula.
At this point, the peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau, then rise out of it again to form the 225-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Range, which the Minnesota Glacier cuts in half.
Antarctica's highest mountain range, Mount Vinson, is located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range. The highest peak in the range is Mount Vinson, which reaches 4,892 m.
A satellite phone may be your only option if you're in a remote area where there's no cell service.
Satellite phones are usually not a replacement for mobile phones, because to make a call, you have to be outside and see the satellite directly.
This is a service often used by shipping companies, including cruise ships and expedition vessels that need voice and data services.
You can find out more about this service from your local telephone service provider.
Combining study and travel is an increasingly popular option for those planning academic vacations.
This option is especially popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take an academic leave before entering the university without compromising their knowledge.
In fact, in many cases, a year-long course of study abroad can increase your chances of admission to a university or college in your home country.
These degrees usually have tuition fees.
Finland is one of the world's best places for rowing and boating, and the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On lakes and archipelagos, you can do without a yacht.
While the largest lakes and offshore archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a very different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland. Here, statistically, there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but nowhere else (for example, in Holland, the ratio is 1 to 40).
Most memorable Baltic cruises feature a lengthy layover in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.
This means that for several full days you have the opportunity to walk through the historic part of the city, returning to the overnight stay on the ship.
You do not need a separate visa if you intend to go ashore only for boat excursions (information as of 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures offer to visit the German Berlin. However, if you look at the map, you can see that Berlin is far from the sea. In addition, the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying can be a scary experience, especially if they've never flown before or have experienced some sort of traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of. It's a fear like many other personal fears or aversions that many people have.
For some, the fear of the unknown or of losing control can be helped by understanding how airplanes are built and what happens during flight.
Courier services are well paid for delivering things quickly. In many cases when delivering business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs time is of great importance.
The big companies had their own planes on some routes, but for other routes and not so big companies, there was a problem.
If things were shipped by air, then perhaps on some routes unloading and customs could take several days.
Sending checked baggage was the only way to get the shipment faster. Airline rules don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to be in first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, have the company do it for you).
But it doesn't come cheap: experience shows that compared to regular economy, you can pay four times as much for business class and more than eleven times for first class!
Basically, there's no point in looking for a direct flight from point A to point B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware of a key group of passengers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Chișinău. The local population speaks Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a country where several nationalities live and where an ethnic conflict took place.
As a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was formed in the eastern part of Moldova in 1994. It has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any EU member state.
Between the two mentioned parts of Moldova were restored economic ties, contrary to the fact that political negotiations did not succeed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodoxy.
Among the cities of Turkey, Izmir is the third largest. Its population is about 3.7 million. It is a very good transportation hub and the second largest port after Istanbul.
The modern, developed and active commercial center is now the ancient city of Smyrna, it is located near a huge bay in the middle of the mountains.
While the city's atmosphere is more in line with Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, broad boulevards, glazed facades and modern shopping malls coexist with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can visit the church, which has an unusual octagonal shape. In addition, a picturesque view of the neighboring island of Esturoy opens from here.
Above some of the tombs in the churchyard are notable sculptures of doves made of marble.
It is worth walking for half an hour through this interesting and unusual village to see its sights.
Nearby to the north is the romantic and exciting town of Sintra, made famous by Lord Byron's brilliant description of His Majesty.
Bus route number 403 of the company "Scotarb" makes regular trips to Sintra. It has a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, we recommend visiting the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Sacred Place), known throughout the world for having repeatedly seen the ghost of the Virgin Mary.
Remember that you are essentially standing on a site of mass graves, the significance of which for a large part of the world's population is simply incapable of being put into words.
And today, there are still quite a few men and women who survived here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or who worked here -- both Jewish and non-Jewish.
We ask you to treat this site with all the seriousness and respect it deserves, not with jokes about Nazis or the Holocaust.
Don't damage this place by writing or painting graffiti anywhere.
Barcelona has two official languages, Spanish and Catalan. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan - most of them understand it. And almost everyone speaks Spanish.
At the same time, most signs use Catalan as it is the official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and elsewhere.
While Catalan is the only language used for regular announcements in the metro, the automated system is used for emergency announcements in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Japanese and Arabic.
Parisians are often described as rude, self-centered, and vain.
Although most of the time this is just a mistaken stereotype, it is still better to show your best manners and be bien élevé (well-mannered) when in Paris, and you will have almost no problems when moving around the city.
If you show a little civility, the sharp behavior of the Parisians will soon disappear.
A large area of the national park "Plitvice Lakes" is covered with forest. Here mainly you can meet beech, Canadian spruce and various other coniferous trees. There is also a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
Due to the wide range of microclimates, different soil types and different altitudes, a variety of plant communities can be found here.
In addition, the area is home to a wide variety of bird and animal species.
Apart from various common species this place is inhabited by such rare animals as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and muskrat.
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders.
Almost all monasteries do offer veils to women who are unaware of these requirements. However, if you bring your own, especially if it is in bright colors, the monks or nuns at the entrance will be very pleased.
Men must wear their trousers below the knees.
They can also be borrowed from the supplies at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each guest, so you may feel uncomfortable in these skirts.
As is the case with the cuisines of many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is characterised by dishes made with vegetables, bread and meat (mainly pork).
A simple and popular, especially in summer, dish is called "Pa Amb Oli". It consists of bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any seasonings that are at hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Even if they are in the middle of a sentence, all nouns, as well as the pronoun Sie (that is, "You"), begin with a capital letter.
Using this way, it is always possible to distinguish the verbs from the nouns that denote objects.
It probably also simplifies reading, but it makes writing somewhat more complicated because you have to understand whether verbs or adjectives are being used in a noun form.
Most words in Italian are pronounced exactly as they are written, so the pronunciation here can hardly be called difficult.
I have to focus on the letters "c" and "g" because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
The consonant "r" and "rr" should be pronounced differently: "caro" translates as "roads", while "carro" is "chariot".
Persian has a relatively simple and predominantly linear grammar.
So after studying this grammar textbook, you will know a lot about Persian grammar and will have a better understanding of phrases.
There is no doubt that knowing any of the Romance languages makes learning Portuguese much easier.
However, people who are able to speak a little Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is similar to it and therefore does not require separate learning.
Today, modern observatories tend to be obsolete and serve as museums or learning centers.
These observatories were typically located in cities or on university campuses, where they were easier to access than modern observatories, and the reason is simple: today, light pollution is a much bigger problem than it was in the past.
The bulk of today's research telescopes are large, giant objects that are usually found in peripheral areas with optimal atmospheric conditions.
"Hanami", which means cherry blossom viewing, entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
The concept is thought to have originated in China, where plum blossoms were prized.
The first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the Emperor of Japan only for himself and other court aristocrats.
Plants look their best in the wild, so don't be tempted to pluck just one.
If you start collecting "specimens" about your visit to a formally ordered garden, you will also be kicked out without any conversation.
In general, Singapore is a safe place to stay and travel, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, if you were just a few degrees north of the equator, in the "high tropics", you would have to cope with both the heat (all the time) and the bright sun (when the sky is clear, much less often).
Several buses also run north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You should make sure that the bus you're about to board is actually going to Hebron, and that it doesn't end at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways are an excellent recreational resource.
You can take a cruise on the Danube to see some sights, visit castles on the Loire and Rhine, or take a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
For popular hiking and biking trails, they also create routes.
In Christianity, the feast that is celebrated as the birth of Jesus is called Christmas. It is one of the most important holidays for believers.
Many customs peculiar to this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians of all countries of the world.
On Easter night, it's traditional to stay up and meet the sunrise somewhere outdoors.
In Christianity, of course, there are specific theological explanations for this tradition, but it may simply be a fertility ritual and the arrival of spring.
An Easter service is usually held by the more traditional churches on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregants often beginning the celebrations at midnight, commemorating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally made it to the islands either swam to them or flew to them.
Giant tortoises have become a staple food in the Galapagos because mammals haven't been able to migrate the long distance between the islands and the mainland.
Many mammals have appeared on the Galapagos since the arrival of humans, including goats, horses, cows, cats, dogs and rats.
But you can get a firsthand experience of what the polar night is like if you go to the Arctic or the Antarctic in the winter, where the sun never rises above the horizon.
You'll be able to enjoy the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
On top of that, you'll be able to enjoy the stars, given that these are sparsely populated areas and light pollution is not a problem.
Japanese work culture is different from what people in Western countries are used to. It is more hierarchical and formal.
Business suits are common business attire, and colleagues address each other by their names or positions.
The importance of a harmonious working relationship cannot be overstated, one that prioritizes the efforts of the whole team over individual achievements.
Employees often need approval from their superiors to make decisions, and they are expected to follow orders from their superiors.
