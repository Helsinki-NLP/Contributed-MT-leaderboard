This supports the theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers and also reveals details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was chestnut-colored on the upper side and carotenoid or light-colored on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed covering (called feathering) but do have other features of feathers (feather-beards); therefore, the researchers have concluded that feathering evolved later in evolution than the other features mentioned.
The structure of the feathers may indicate that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or to change appearance.[1] The researchers propose that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage, not the plumage of a juvenile.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the force the Moon exerts on the Earth causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to demonstrate that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy exists as a halo around the galaxy that is made up of many small particles.

Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa by Dr. Tony Moll.
He mentioned in an interview that the new variant is "very worrying and serious, because it has a very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes it is possible that some patients contracted the disease while in the hospital, at least two of whom were members of the hospital's medical staff.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the proportion of people with SXDR-TB among all people with tuberculosis is low; in South Africa, this would amount to 6,000 people out of 330,000 people who may be infected.

In France, the voting procedure is typically a low-tech experience: those who are about to vote walk into a booth, take a piece of paper with the name of the candidate of their choice pre-printed on it, and place it into a sealed envelope.
After the technicians verify the identity of the person to vote, the person voting places the envelope in the ballot box, and signs the voting list.
French electoral law has fairly strictly codified procedures.
Since 1988 the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that the person who has voted and observers can clearly see that at the beginning of the voting there are no envelopes and that nothing is added except those inserted by authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process, but in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers, closely monitored and following strict procedures.

Four members of the women's seated team failed to finish the descent, and 45 of the 117 skiers who participated in the giant slalom failed to qualify.
The Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya has stated that five suspects have been arrested in connection with the rape of the Swiss woman whose laptop and mobile phone have been recovered.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of the three were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road that was the scene of the accident was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of his son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the evidence of these witnesses may not be entirely convincing given that his image has been widely published.
Now, this is common practice in Britain, but the Scottish legal system works in a different way, and the courts have held that publishing those photos can be damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee has said that "journalists walk a fine line when they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for complaints, has told reporters that it will not comment further, at least until a complaint is made.
According to the leak, the document relates to the border dispute, in which the Palestinian demand to restore the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to reports, other issues discussed included the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine wants it limited to five years.
The hunters undergoing the supplementary pest control trial were closely monitored by the rangers, who were monitoring the trial and evaluating its effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (New South Wales), qualified volunteers were selected as part of the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, said the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had undergone comprehensive safety and training procedures.
The new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) was sworn in by President Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the current CEP should step down as one of the steps the country needs to take towards new elections.
The committee was set up by Martelly to respond to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Several protests, sometimes violent, erupted over the inability to organize elections, which have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning and overheating iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported 27 incidents related to the device.
Last week, the Met revealed that Apple had received an additional 34 reports of overheating, which the company described as "mild".
The ministry responded by saying it was "highly regrettable" that Apple reported the cases so late.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands reports no damage has been reported in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has confirmed there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has kidnapped Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital of Manila after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as two Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and studied medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm births in his spare time.
The research that was done showed that if they gave him a hormone the baby's fetal lungs contracted faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators had recovered on Wednesday two 'black boxes' which contained footage of the flight.
Luna was also honored by his fellow wrestlers.
According to Tommy Dreamer, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night of two moons. A special night like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as cold-blooded as I am... maybe even more so... and I will love and miss her... and hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election showed an 8% increase in opposition to Australia becoming a republic since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gilliard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The poll found that 29 per cent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the aforementioned injuries her fitness has been called into question.
He's been unable to take the pain medication he needs because it's banned in the Games.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people by early February, using various hardware and software, and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Shooting stars may have been one of the primary sources of Earth's water supply, as well as a source of organic matter that can form proteins and help life evolve.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets form, particularly the formation of the Earth, which is thought to have been hit by meteors long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He describes gossip as "political chatter and nonsense".
He has alluded to running for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to outdated ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more accurately locate the aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the Metro will not stop at Wembley, there is no car park and no outside parking and drop-off facilities.
Fearing a lack of transportation, he put on the table the possibility that the match would have to be made by people and fans of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species has emerged in just two generations, a process that was thought to be much longer; Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris) have been bred together.
Gold can be made into any shape you want, you can roll it up into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wires; it can be twisted and twirled; it can be hammered, or crushed into sheet metal.
It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical compound, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage water.
The water of the cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical compound.
The pH level indicates how many hydrogen ions (the H of pH) are present in the chemical compound used for testing.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (in fact, one proton and one ion form a hydrogen atom).
Mix the two dry powders together and crumple them into a ball with wet, clean hands.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a certain sensation, forming a kind of shell.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet that pumped water, connected to a sophisticated wastewater system.
Remains of wastewater systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were also toilets, and in the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, shared by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and bounces it back down almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A spacecraft with a height greater than 100 feet is required to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has fundamentally changed the world. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to allow for easier and faster transportation.
He's brought us trains, cars and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits and antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are numerous other small cats (including domestic cats) that eat smaller prey that are more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the Nicho, where each type of cat does a specific job so that they don't need to compete with the others.
Lions are social cats that live in large groups.
Lion prides consist of one to three male lions and up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are more closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions function in much the same way as packs of wolves or dogs; they are very similar to lions in behavior (but not as large as other big cats) and are very dangerous to prey.
The tiger is a very good athlete, able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump high, and pull with five times the force of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group as the lion, panther and jaguar (genus Panthera) and these four cats are the only ones that can moo.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's loud roar, it's more like a series of threatening words shouted out.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if given the opportunity.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate animals that they will eat (prey) by sniffing out tracks on the ground.
Ocelots have excellent night vision and are able to move very quietly, hiding in the environment and surprising their prey by jumping on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the original main population (for example, if it moves from a mountain range or river, or if it cannot easily return from a new island), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will require different traits or adaptations than it previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, requiring all the same adaptations as they did before.
As time progresses, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment and resembles the original population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will be so different from each other that they can no longer refer to the same species.
Many of the world's most endangered mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises, have been driven to the brink of extinction.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (breathe out).
Plants feed with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis, and also provide shade.
We make our homes from plant parts, we make our clothes from plant parts, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, no animal could survive.
Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of the time, so it wasn't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
It had a long jaw lined with 70 sharp teeth, and another set in the maxilla, so it could not escape anything that came its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may also have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is thought it may have been cannibalistic.
Plus, it was viciously attacking anything that tried to get into the water, so even a giant T. Rex wouldn't have been a match for it.
Although many of the Roman dishes are familiar to us, they also included unusual or unusual banquet dishes, such as wild boar, poultry, snails, and the rodent muskrat.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals seated while rich men ate their meals together lying side by side.
The ancient Romans could not have eaten the foods that came to Europe centuries later from America or Asia.
For example, they didn't have corn or tomatoes or potatoes or cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't taste turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each deity, which they considered to be the home of the deity.
People brought sacrifices to the god, and the priests tried to respond to the needs of the gods by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, as well as an inner sanctuary that could only be used by priests.
Pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Much of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were open counters facing the street, they used stone to build their houses.
There were not many forests in the land of Canaan, and so wood was very expensive.
There haven't been very many settlements on Greenland -- in the Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, tribes of Eskimos were already living there.
While each of these countries was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you'd probably think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
While there may be some writing on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are these words: "Declaration of Independence, original, dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that the large parchment document was initially rolled up for storage (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches).
It is therefore quite possible that he simply added the note as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940, collaborating with the Germans rather than opposing the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an invasion codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and began to move into Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together cooperatively like a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in turn defines the size of a society.
City-states are the foundation stones of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through generations, that there is a cultural imprint and that there is an equitable transmission.
Lower-level cultures disappear without significant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the first thirteen states formed formed a weak central government, with congress as its only component, and was dependent on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, the states' authorities had the authority to enforce its laws, though they often did not help.
Additionally, it had no authority to invalidate tax laws or charges between states.
They needed the unanimous consent of all the states before they could change the articles, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives rarely appeared.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national team, the second most successful national football team in the world, and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
In the northern regions, winter sports are the most practiced, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the multitude of islands that Japan has, it is geographically referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed through and named the beautiful island Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company settled in southwestern Taiwan, and the natives began transforming their crop-growing activities and employing Chinese laborers to work on the rice and sugar plantations there.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to show tourists what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty-three percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, in still-image photography the 35 mm format is the most common worldwide, as this was the predominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its proportion has been continued by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, confusingly, the 35 mm format has a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
The ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of complex numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) have the same or close to this ratio.
The overused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamism in an image while maintaining some order.
The rule states that the most effective locations for placing the main subject are the points where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the European states were united by Christianity despite their different languages and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from the king down to the common man.
It is one of the central tenets of Christianity that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been firmly established in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church was living up to this principle.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a blockade of German shipping.
Cutting off access to essential military and civilian supplies was an effective strategy, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified through numerous international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters denying ships access to large parts of the ocean and also endangering neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare she was conducting.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most people and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were anxious to avoid such conditions in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York.
She arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (her manager at her previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing each period each Chinese period or family of power was a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days, there were ferocious wars between the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people killed fighting for the right to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are various social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were made available to all men, allowing only the most ambitious and successful to flourish.
The same was true in the military, where instead of rank in the army being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired the working classes of other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a keen interest in matters beyond his daily life and would often go to a cave for contemplation, which he called "Hira" and which was located on a mountain called "Noor" (light).
The cave, which has survived the test of time, is a testament to Muhammad's spiritual nature.
A cave on top of a mountain north of Mecca is completely isolated from the world.
In fact, even if you know where it is, it's hard to find.
All you can see is the clear blue sky above and the mountains that surround it and little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still intact today.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century B.C., one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Death Valley contains several pyramids, small tombs, temples, as well as the Great Sphinx (with the Great Pyramid being the largest of them all).
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of Pharaoh Khufu, and the smaller pyramids and many tombs and temples were built in honour of Khufu's wives and family members.
The mark for "move the bow up" is V-shaped and the mark for "move the bow down" is either a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Going up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and going down means you have to start at the base (where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement produces a stronger and more concentrated sound.
You can make your marks with a pencil, but the printed bow marks are made for musical reasons, and so should be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a large group of market women on 6 October 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage, accompanied by a raucous crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd shakes the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs incurred by U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipinos themselves.
A large portion of the costs were forced on the American colonial regime to pay taxes and interest on bonds issued through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the primary profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period of these events is called the Classical Middle Ages in European history, and covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Classic Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and succeeded by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism includes many ideas in practice; that it is an impulse or necessity induced by technology, that human destiny is guided by an implicit logic that is subject to scientific laws (and the manner in which these appear in technology).
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the following two general ideas: on the one hand, that the development of technology goes beyond any political or cultural power, and, on the other, that technology simultaneously "influences" societies themselves more than societies influence technology.
For example, one could say that having motor cars inevitably entails the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable if there are only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to make it cheaper to own cars.
The more massive the car ownership, the more accidents occur on the roads, but this also leads to the creation of new techniques for treating injuries in the medical field.
Romanticism was an important element of the cultural determinism derived from Goethe, Fichte, Schlegel, and similar writers.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and as time went on, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they fit the place of the society.
We think of Paris as the fashion capital of the modern world, but the center of feudal Europe was Constantinople.
It began to be an epicenter of luxury around 400 AD, and its popularity lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined in the 12th century, largely because the returning crusaders brought gifts of silk fabrics and spices, and these goods were valued higher than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Constantinople ceased to be the capital of fashion in favor of Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the costumes were heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as the means of communication were slow, the styles arrived in the west with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own distinctive style, one of the great innovations of which came when the Crusaders began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families is called sustainability agriculture.
Sustainable farming is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds and crop rotation or similar simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ways of thinking and who feel they are outside of societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
There are many ways to distinguish subcultures, such as by age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture make distinctive and symbolic use of style to show their membership, which includes fashions, idiosyncrasies, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is through the unfortunate cases of children who did not have the opportunity to socialize with adults while growing up due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
Some feral children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents), while others were abandoned by parents who would not accept a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It's likely that many of these child abusers experienced abuse or severe childhood trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some people say that they have been raised by animals, others say that they have lived by themselves in the wild.
In the case of feral children raised by non-human animals, they tend to exhibit behaviors that are nearly identical (within physical limits) to that particular guardian animal, such as fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The scaffolding method is not a method of learning, but rather a way of assisting those immersed in a new learning experience, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or it can be real, so in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, as is the little clipboard man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software, providing questions, annotations and explanations of procedures that can be difficult for students to manage alone.
Children who enter the lobby are there for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children shouldn't have to grow up in environments that don't support them, care for them, educate them, but they do.
For kids like this, we like to think of the Reception System as a safe zone.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Their hosts must provide them with all the necessities they lacked in the homes they left behind.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The multiple features of the Internet allow access to additional aspects related to usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are said to be the main motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as motivational areas by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated people's reaction to web sites.
Very important breakthroughs have been made using video recordings of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds when interpreted.
In particular, it is said that by correctly interpreting microexpressions one can tell if a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in the article "Scientific Paper on the President's Speech", states that people who due to brain damage are unable to understand speech are still able to appreciate sincerity.
And he says that other animals have this ability to interpret human behavior in this way, such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variants: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variants, while selection removes them from the set of expressed variants.
Discrimination and recombination transforms one set of variations into another in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to obtain the amino acids it needs from the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would be the most readily available plant resources, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest when uncooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also contain high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
During the process of sleep interruption, you are deliberately awakened during normal sleep and fall asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a low-level alarm that causes you to be conscious but not fully awake.
If you reset the clock while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so I don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another of the possibilities based on biorhythms is to drink plenty of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic), to force you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is, and all people are capable of finding absolute peace and fulfillment.
All of us can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of our achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was popularized with the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it has elements of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of God, the manifestation of various deities through which the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany had many enemies during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, clashes in systems, processes, and culture alienated the countries from each other.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war dragged on for the next 40 years, and there was actual fighting, through proxies, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and as many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Almost overnight, however, these plans became obsolete when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's traditional role has been to maintain a country's ability to move people and goods while simultaneously disrupting the ability of adversaries to move people and goods.
The most notable example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were eager to send men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
Likewise, the German navy used U-boats to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early cultures and tribes began to breed goats for the easy availability of milk, wool, meat, and skins.
They were usually kept in herds of goats, working on the hills or other grazing areas, under the care of goats who were children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Waterwheels were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the trackways were only parallel wooden planks, being dragged by horses allowed them to gain more speed and carry heavier loads on the rough roads of the time.
Rivets were added fairly early to secure the rails, but gradually it was realised that rails would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
It became more common, but with the influence of iron, the wooden wheels of the organ wore out more.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made of pure iron were used.
The earliest known form of transport is walking, as humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, rarely walked upright.
Bipedal specialisation has been found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old australopithecine fossils, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a way that is more environmentally friendly, we can join environmental mobilizations, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering as much as possible.
They are often used as a symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we only want a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems so that they can be addressed.
There is evidence that the world has changed greatly thanks to humanity's scientific and technological progress, and that the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the humanity's wasteful lifestyle.
After its adoption in Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press nearby.
Known as the "Dunlap Papers", between 150 and 200 copies were made that night.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his army on 9 July in New York, and a copy reached London on 10 August.
They are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today -- we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds share many traits with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they crawl on their two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (or, in computer jargon, bits).
Intestinal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, but the vomiting and other symptoms are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
An open container of pharmaceuticals or toxic household cleaning chemicals is the first symptom of a severe intestinal infection.
Make sure you read the label to learn the first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bed bug to refer to this group of insects.
They are so named because of their ancient resemblance to bed bugs and their ability to parasitize humans.
Both the assassin bug and the bed bug are nymphs, and are accustomed to living in nests and on living hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
AD is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to have AS as men.
It's possible that a couple might decide that having a baby isn't the best thing for them or the baby.
There's a chance that couple might be able to work out an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights to have another couple parent the child.
Knowing how the world works using the scientific method is the ultimate goal of science, and it is this method that drives most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing that should be done; also, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions, and observation also guides scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were adopted, including philosophy.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West became increasingly alienated from Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
The existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks is crucial to many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living things: bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that continue to function for a period of time on their own in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key clues to the identity of DNA as genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were performed: labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the portion of genetic material affected, and whether or not the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas, who go with the purpose of enjoying the landscape (including fauna and flora).
Some examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
We're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to have a lot of fun.
Every morning, people from small towns in the countryside leave their homes to go to work and cross the paths of people who work in the place they have just left.
And within this transportation dynamic, everyone in the world is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system based on private cars.
As science has revealed, this extraordinary carbon economy has altered over the last two million years the stable state of the biosphere which has supported human evolution.
Everybody is involved in society and everybody uses transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Many people have wondered why transportation systems elicit such complaints, why they fail every day, are their transportation technicians unqualified, or is there an underlying problem?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two destinations and the relationships between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers have a fairly regular behavior; thus traffic flows are fairly consistent and can be expressed mathematically roughly.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relations have been specified in terms of three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships guide the planning, design and legislation of road services.
Insects were the first to learn to fly, their ability to fly making it easier for them to evade enemies and find food and mating partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of having their wings folded behind the body.
This allows them to hide in smaller spaces away from predators.
Today, the only insects unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and that the Sun (and other stars) did too.
Which makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the largest river, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The widest river on Earth is also the Amazon, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.[1] It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the scale and technical brilliance of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the thousand-year-old monuments of their ancestors.
With a population of approximately 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least densely populated.
In Vatican City, Italian is used for laws and official communications.
Italian is also the common language of most who work in public services, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Everyone in Vatican City is a Roman Catholic.
Gold, silver, copper, and other chemical elements have been known since antiquity and can be found in nature in pristine form and are relatively easy to extract with crude tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things were composed of some combination of one or more of the four elements which were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.[1] He also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, and let's not forget there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys with a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as those containing carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was invented, it became a great friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to pick up a sharpener again.
Who knows what will happen to that keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
Like lifting a heavy cart up a hill, when the nucleus splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break with little or no assistance.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the surface.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the leading side and about 100 km wide on the trailing side.
It's thinner under the moon-seas, and thicker on higher ground.
There may have been more lunar maria in the foreground because the surface is thinner, it was easier to pump the lava to the surface.
Content theories are concerned with what makes people tick or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wants that they internalize as they reach adulthood.
These theories focus on two ideas: why people want things and what things in their environment will influence them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two well-known content theories.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that can arise when a director begins to direct his former colleagues: first, to remain a "boy" (or girl) of the group.
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce discipline, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
And then you get this other, unrecognizable person who feels the need to change and own everything that the group has ever done.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This attitude often causes friction between the leaders of the group and other members.
Virtual teams are composed of the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Members of virtual groups function as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than their regular group members, perhaps because the groups gather according to shifting time zones, which is not understood by their local management.
An exclusive component of a virtual group is also the presence of a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The executive team to which each team member reports is the invisible group.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing an educational institution? Innovation is one of the purposes of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When existing resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flow freely.
Consequently, from a process of working together to address an obstacle within an organization, innovative processes to meet customer needs can emerge.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership needs to create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
The continuum approach is described by Angel (2006) as a method for organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition is provided by neurobiological data, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more specific.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supported the scientists' study.
We've known for a long time that many different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, brain tumors affect behavior and change some brain functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build stimulation models that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important branch of computer science, involving the behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine's intelligence.
In AI research, machines are trained to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and organization, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have morphed into separate disciplines that are meant to provide solutions to life's problems.
AI systems are widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but also in some software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of a classroom and often the teacher would like to take the students somewhere that the bus cannot go.
Technology offers the solution of virtual field trips where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful artwork while sitting side by side with classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on it and share your experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their annual field trip to the state capitol.[citation needed] The website changes every year, but older versions are maintained online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start blogs with poor grammar and spelling, having a readership can often change that.
Since the most discerning readers are often students, to avoid criticism, the writer of the blog often makes an effort to improve his writing.
Writing blogs also "inspires students to learn more about the world around them", inspiring students to be smart and interesting to meet the needs of their readers' interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to share knowledge beyond the regular school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can specify their attitude in the context of others' writing, as well as summarize their view of certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the wonderful, bilingual capital of Canada and has a good selection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south, you have the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka region and so on.
All of these things and more are what make Ontario, in the eyes of outsiders, the most Canadian of Canadians.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited jungle.
A population comparison that will surprise many people is that there are more African Americans in the United States than there are in the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and it's a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France, and are known as luxury holiday resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, occupying a large area in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female passengers are advised to disclose that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to carry a ring (but one that does not look very expensive).
Women need to be aware that the attitudes that they might perceive as harassment are cultural differences, and that it's common for people to follow, to grab your arm, and so on.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not appropriate!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the same fishermen in the 20th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least interesting place to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find traditional Moroccan artifacts such as daggers, ceramics, leather goods, crockery and all kinds of handicrafts, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma when lava flooded the city's streets, especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all travel outside of Goma must be examined for a full picture of the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for treks to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as the cheapest routes to see the mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.[1] The typical (actual) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Because it is relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor to talk about exotic and distant lands.
Today, it is a poor town, but its fame attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of Africa.
There's a big difference between the city and the rest of the country, it's more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which is home to a wide variety of fauna.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there are daily quotas for entry to the park and for conservation.
For some it might be useful to buy a Wild Card, which gives access to all South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, and is the main point of attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's silhouette has been compared to a glowing bar diagram displayed by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront urban area.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in the reclaimed area on the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonists claimed as their own, so if you're looking for clues to the region's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove swamp in the world, covering 80 km (50 mi) in width from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[1] The forest that covers the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps, but also the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/mud.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 cheetahs.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese shuttle buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and convenient transportation to nearby destinations such as Parora (No. 150) and Punakhara (No. 200).
The Oyapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapok River connecting Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge has two lanes with a length of 378 meters and a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge has a height of 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs are completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The 16th-century Paraguay, previously called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was the result of the mixture between the Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is very famous for having the best polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here throughout the year.
If you want news about championships and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equal to the British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can only be changed at the island's only bank, Stanley's, just down the road from the FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere and at the Stanley they also accept credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the local islands, but British and American currency is. Check with the owners in advance if you can use this method of payment.
It's almost impossible to change Falkland Island money outside the islands, so change your money before you leave the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and during the summer months, it is common to have temperatures above 30oC.
Winters can be very cool; frost is uncommon, but winds and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no known "wet" or "dry" season: it receives a similar amount of rainfall throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of humans, the fauna is wild and cannot be fed or disturbed.
In accordance with the National Park Service, you must stay at least 100 yards or yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards or yards away from other wild animals.
Although they may appear docile, all large animals such as bison, moose, bear, and the like can attack.
Every year, several visitors are injured because they don't keep the necessary distance, the animals are big, wild and dangerous.
Also consider that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells, and keep the campground clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was discovered in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous 1889 water dispute, in which seven ships from Germany, the U.S. and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All shipping was sunk except for a British cruiser, and some 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village resulted in the assassination of a paramount chief named Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland is located between two harbours, there are many beaches; the most famous are in three areas.
The north coast beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean; they extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and there is shade from pohutukawa trees most of the time.
In the Waitemata Harbour in central Auckland are the beaches of Tamaki Drive in the high-end neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These beaches are usually crowded with families and there are many shops along the coastline.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines fare better than ours.
The water from the local fountain is drinkable, but bottled water can be found everywhere if you're not too trusting.
For Australians, a coffee called a "flat white" is unfamiliar.[1] Plain coffee is called an "espresso", cappuccino has cream (without toppings) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made according to Belgian standards, the juices are expensive, but perfect.
Excursions to the reefs are held throughout the year and injuries related to these activities are extremely rare.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, pay attention to the signs and pay close attention to the security measures.
The cubozo is present on beaches and estuaries from October to April in 1770 N. They can also be found outside this area during this season.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, so most sharks avoid humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their main habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
You know, with advance booking, travelers will feel more comfortable when they get to the airport knowing they have a place to stay.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you can use their services to find other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer deals that combine breakfast, transportation from or to the airport, or flight and hotel.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or prepare travel documentation (such as a visa) to travel there.
Changes or reservations must be made through the travel agent, not by contacting the hotel directly.
In the case of some festivals, most music festival attendees choose to camp there, with most considering it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll want to get there early and find a campsite near the music area.
Please remember that even though the music has ended on the main stages, in other parts of the festival, the music may continue late into the night.
Some festivals have areas that families with children can use for camping.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's position, as crossing ice creates extreme noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also provide an opportunity to spend time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa-related obligations (see specifications).
Casinos go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible, there are usually no windows or clocks and finding the exits is not easy.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to stay longer.
Some places even offer alcoholic drinks on the house, but drunkenness and sobriety don't go hand in hand, and the best gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Those planning to drive in high latitudes or through mountains should be aware that snow, ice, or very low temperatures are possible.
On roads that are icy or snowbound, there is very little friction and you cannot drive as well as on asphalt.
When there's a blizzard, it can snow enough to get you stuck.
There may be reduced visibility due to snow, condensation or ice on the windows of your vehicle.
On the other hand, frosts and snowfalls are common in many countries and traffic is usually not interrupted throughout the year.
Safaris in Africa are a major tourist attraction and a memorable moment for many visitors.
The term safari, in common parlance, specifically refers to a journey to view the wildlife that inhabits the African savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, approach the cars and a good view can be obtained using standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and panthers are sometimes shy and will be easier to see with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also called "bush walks", "walking safaris" or "hikes") are walks that last for hours or days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, doing so in 1964.
If you've booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before you've announced the delay, you may find yourself in a tricky situation.
The cancellation guidelines are subject to change, but until March, the coronavirus-induced cancellations will not be extended until July 2020, the date on which the Olympics will be held.
Tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets around ¥7,000.
If you iron wet clothes, they'll dry faster, and many hotels have iron and ironing boards you can borrow, even if there are none in the room.
If a flat iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer as an option if one is available.
Do not overheat the fabric (it can shrink clothes or, in the worst cases, burn them).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others in terms of known risks.
In some places it is enough to boil water for a minute; in other places it takes several minutes.
Some filters are more effective than others and if you're worried we recommend you buy a sealed bottle of water from one of the big companies.
In their native countries, travelers may encounter unfamiliar animal pests.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or in worse cases an allergic reaction, as well as spread poison or transmit infections.
Animals that are dangerous with infectious diseases or that can injure or kill people by violence are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is a good option in some places to buy products free of duty and tax.
Travelers from countries with high taxes can save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic products and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult section to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Road and requires traversing remote locations that are often very isolated.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, have a sense of humour: steep sections, narrow paths and sharp curves prevail.
The speed limits on the signs are significantly lower than on the previous sections, usually 35-40 m/h, 56-64 km/h, and it is very important to follow them.
Oddly enough, there's more coverage there than other points along the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
Pastries in Germany are very sweet and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, similar to those of the region's southern neighbour Austria.
Small fruit cakes are common and they put apples on the cakes throughout the year, while in summer they use cherries and plums.
Many German sweets contain almonds, apricots, and other nuts. Popular pastries tend to go especially well with a bowl of coffee.
If you want small but rich cakes, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is based on herbs and spices and is combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be described as "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In North India and the interior of Pakistan, yogurt is widely used to make curry, while in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
There are 17,000 islands in Indonesia and the term Indonesian cuisine includes the cuisines of many regions.
However, without further qualifiers, this term usually refers to the food of central and eastern Java.
Javanese cuisine is now used throughout the archipelago and includes a variety of dishes prepared in a modest manner, in fact, the favorite flavors of Javanese people are peanut, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports on which the rider stands and hang on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider a great deal of stability but there may be safety risks involved as the rider may become trapped.
If the rider falls off the horse but one of the legs gets stuck in the stirrups, the horse can drag him if he tries to leave.

Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports and involve sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a multi-enthusiast activity that also includes travel.[1] These enthusiasts are commonly referred to as "ski travelers" because they organize their vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, we can find figures of skiers in caves dating back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing society was founded in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Trapeze skiing: This activity is also called ski touring.
It is related to, but not related to, alpine ski-style mountaineering because it is done on slopes and requires stronger skis and boots.
Just think of ski trails the same way you think of hiking trails.
In good conditions, you will walk a greater distance than you do on foot, but few will manage to reach the speed of mountain skiing without a backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with a large number of independent countries. In a typical situation, one would need to apply for a visa to travel to several countries and go through several security checks.
On the contrary, the Schengen Area functions more like a country in this respect.
As long as you are within that zone, you can cross borders without having to go through passport control.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to enter each country that is part of the Schengen Area and thus save time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition to determine which handmade products are considered antiques.[1] The tax agencies define antiques as properties that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically; the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.

Before undergoing surgery, transgender people cannot expect to pass any scans without violating their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are tidal currents created by waves breaking on a beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in the deeper sections where it creates a fast deep-water current.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, from which it is impossible to swim out.
Once you're out of the current, it won't be any harder than usual to swim to shore.
Try to grab onto something where you can't get pulled back in. Or, depending on your skill or if you've been seen, wait for help.
The return shock strikes earlier than the culture shock (it is less reminiscent of the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.

Finland is an excellent sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands and archipelagos along the lakes.
Archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, small boats or kayaks offer different experiences.
Boating is the most common recreational activity in Finland, and as such there is a boat for seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is a fairly significant number (for example, in the Netherlands the proportion is one in forty people).
Most major Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That way, you have a couple of useful days to visit the historic town, and return to the boat at night to sleep.
If you only use boat trips to go ashore, you do not need another visa (as of 2009).

Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. Many people have personal fears or disgust.
Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens in flight can help some people deal with their fear based on the unknown or something out of their control.
Airmail companies are well paid to send things quickly, time is often critical in the case of business documents, merchandise or replacement parts for an emergency repair.
Some routes, big companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had problems with these issues.
If they ship products via air freight, some routes take several days for the products to be unloaded and clear customs.
Sending the products as checked baggage was the only way to speed up the process. However, airlines do not allow bags to be sent without passengers, so this may be an option you can take advantage of.
Without a doubt, the smartest way to travel business or first class is to pay a lot of money (or, better yet, have your company pay the amount) for this privilege.
However, this option does not come cheap: typically, a business class flight is four times more expensive than an economy fare and, in the case of first class, eleven times more expensive!
In general, it does not make sense to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from one destination to another.
The airlines know full well that there is a group of passengers who are willing to pay high prices to get anywhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly for the privilege.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.

Similarly, men must wear trousers below the knee.
You can also borrow from the supplies at the entrance, but since these clothes aren't washed after they've been worn by a human, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.

One of the traditions is to stay up on Easter Eve in the open air to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also have been a spring and fertility rite in pre-Christian times.
The more traditional churches hold the Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and at midnight the congregation usually begins the feast to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
In the very beginning, all the animals that came to the islands came swimming, flying or floating.
