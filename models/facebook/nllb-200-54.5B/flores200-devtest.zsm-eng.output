This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides specific details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is dark brown on top with the underside being pale or carotenoid-colored.
The study also provides insight into the evolution of feather plumes in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stalk, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers - spines and barbels - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development of these other features that came later.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight purposes but rather for temperature control or for display.
The researchers suggested that, although it was a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not juvenile feathers.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for is caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth that causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that dark matter throughout the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves inside a voting booth, placing a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law explicitly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are inserted except those belonging to counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send delegates to witness each part of the process. In the afternoon, the votes will be counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to a specific procedure.

Other topics covered reportedly included the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in additional pest control experiments must be closely supervised by rangers, while the experiment is monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A Presidential Commission last month recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to mobilize the country for the implementation of new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime riots that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by failed elections, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents associated with the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had announced an additional 34 extreme heating events, but the company considered them "not serious".
The ministry has responded by calling the delay of the report from Apple "extremely disappointing".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time pg (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as was a Filipino photographer.
The photographer then took the old woman's place because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins had begun investigating preterm labor in her spare time.
His research shows that if the hormone is administered it will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Pretty unique like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented "Luna as weird as I am ...maybe more so...love her and will miss her...may her soul be placed in heaven".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints led many to question her fitness.
He was unable to take the medicine he needed to keep his pain at bay because it had been banned from the Resistance.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have delivered water to Earth as well as organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and had signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track aircraft locations and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the games would be run without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the new species had evolved after only two generations, although the process is believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all sorts of shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven.
It can be made very thin, and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-painted drawings called "fragmentary manuscripts".
You can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, roll the powder into a ball.
The fluid on your hands will react to the outer layer, which will feel weird and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan townhouses of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. By Roman times, toilets were part of public baths where men and women mingled freely.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, that means you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up the call and bounce it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
Wheels have changed the world in incredible ways, but the greatest contribution wheels have made to us is the creation of easier, faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to deer and kancil.
Finally, there are many small-sized cats (including feral cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups called "lion packs".
A pride is made up of one to three adult males, along with as many as thirty females and their cubs.
Female clans were often close to each other, as they consisted of extended families of sisters as well as daughters.
Lion Prides behave much like a pack of wolves or dogs, an impressive animal similar in behavior to lions (but not big cats) and also very dangerous to its prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with a force five times that of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, more like a jumble of words, a shout of words.
The ocelot is a small predator, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that the ocelot stalks and finds prey by smelling the ground it has crossed.
The ocelot hunts its prey by hiding in an environment that resembles its body color and then pouncing on its prey.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) separate from the main population from which they originated (for example if they wander across mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily relocate) they often end up in a different environment than before.
These new environments have diverse resources and different competitors, so the new populations will need different characteristics or adaptations to be strong competitors than they did before.
The natives haven't changed at all, they're still as much in need of adjustment as ever.
Over time, as the new residents begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they're no longer the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and an essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen inhaled by humans and take up the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans (when breathing).
Plants make food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of their day, making them fearless, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra set located in its palate, which means there's no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a dinosaur as monstrous as a T. rex would be no match for it.
Although many of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or exotic foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, rich people liked to make a joint feast where they would relax on their sides while they ate their meals.
The diet of ancient Rome is unlikely to have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or yams, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that they considered to be the home of that deity.
People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that is only allowed to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats, were built to be part of such temples.
The top of the tower became a sanctuary for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home is no longer so important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place in an open environment.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was a very expensive resource.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discoveries, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences in people, monarch, culture and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you probably think of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
It says on the back of the Declaration of Independence "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this massive document patch (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's possible that the notation was added just as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by "Vichy" France, the French who made peace with Germany in 1940 and chose to collaborate with the occupiers rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned the tide against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning public, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas meaning city or town, and that also however defines the size of a society.
Cities are the beginning of a nation. The culture of civilization marks the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the permanent imprint of culture and its equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as complete civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, as there was no national judicial executive, it depended on the power of the states, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
It also had no right to veto interstate tax and tariff laws.
This article required the unanimous consent of all districts before they could amend and the districts took the central government lightly as their representatives were frequently absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands belonging to the State of Japan, the State of Japan from a geographical standpoint, is commonly referred to as an archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, Taiwan was first sighted and recorded by European traders who called the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Tripartite Chamber.
Most of the dilapidated buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu will have been restored and restoration work continues to this day
For example, the most common image in fortography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, rather confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. formats from the APS family) are the same or nearly the same as this aspect ratio.
The often abused and derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining orderly proportions in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very wealthy and powerful, began to be questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite their differences in language and customs.
His absolute power affects everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and misery and the church's financial resources are dedicated to that cause.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and the power of power and money caused many to question whether this belief had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although these restrictions did not comply with generally accepted international law embodied by several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the rest of the ocean, causing danger even to ordinary ships.
Since there was a limited response to these tactics, the Germans expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude for most people and countries was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, some nations wanted to avoid such conditions in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his old job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time, each stage of China or each ruling family at that time had its own dynasty.
Between each dynasty there were also periods of unstable and fragmented territories, most notably the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In the meantime a fierce war had broken out between several nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody era in the history of Ancient China thousands of dead people fought for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
Various social and political effects would exist such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolute rule to a republican system, as well as the realization and spirit of nationalism that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
As well, after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
It's the same in the military, because instead of ranking soldiers by class, they're now ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in this extraordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as "Hira" in Mount Noor (light) to think.
He carved himself, survived all that time, giving a very clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if one knows it exists.
There's nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the mountains around it.
The great pyramids of Giza are one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
On the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead are several pyramids (among them the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
Large pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were developed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "swipe up" mark is similar to the letter V and the "swipe down" mark is similar to the shape of a rod or an equilateral triangle without a bottom.
Top means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and bottom means you have to start at the frog and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a softer sound while a down-bow produces a louder, more assertive sound.
Feel free to write your own signs, but please remember that printed signs are there for musical purposes.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a group of women in the market.
Riding in a horse-drawn carriage, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats to the King and Queen.
A mob had forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a rioter held up the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Empress.
The cost of U.S. imperialism's war to conquer the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to bear most of the expenses and interest of the floating bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits associated with the continued exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that triggered the creation of the order.
The era in which the events take place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000 -1300)
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas practiced, from technological progress or the primacy of technology to the strong feeling that human destiny is driven by logic related to scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on existing societies, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles led to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network was not viable for only a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The very high car ownership also resulted in an increase in road accidents which led to the creation of new techniques in healthcare to restore injured body parts.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time there emerged customs and cultures associated with this geography.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion center of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion center of feudal Europe.
It was known as a centre of luxury beginning around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century mainly due to the Crusaders who had returned with gifts such as silks and spices worth hundreds more than what was offered in the Byzantine markets.
At this time the transfer of the title of Fashion Model from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the trend in the west may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own styles.
Subsistence farming is farming practised to produce food for the needs of the members of the farm and their outgoings.
Crop rotation is a simple system, often organic, that uses stored seeds originating from a single ecological area and combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel they are ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop an identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The defining qualities of different cultural branches may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geography or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural branch typically display their membership through certain styles symbolically, whether in fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take into account several unfortunate cases of children of neglect, misfortune, or abuse intentionally not socializing with adults as they grew up.
Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Other children were allegedly raised by animals; some were said to live alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the animal that cared for it, such as a fearful or indifferent attitude toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make the learning process easier and more interesting, Scaffolding does more than that.
Scaffolding is not a method for learning but rather an aid that supports individuals in undertaking new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be either virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding and so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is integrated into the software and acts to question, assist, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse and also for the purpose of extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they're not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they do.
We see the foster system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs that cannot be provided in the home where the child is taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al, 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting small facial changes.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President Speaks, shows how people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to translate human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two types of clusters of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
New genetic changes the addition of mutations and selection remove from the set of prominent changes.
Isolation and recombination reshuffle the variation between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, it's very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: increased depression, unbalanced nutrition, and eventual death.
The most abundant plant source of protein is found in leaves and nuts, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame their "protein problem" the same way savanna chimps do today.
A sleep disorder is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep briefly (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a silent alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, unknown diuretics) before bed, forcing a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace in one's mind has an inverse correlation to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the greater the presence of a positive life spirit.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but has been extended with the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
Kundalini energy (energy of consciousness) is triggered with Kundalini Yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods depicting various deities clearing the energy channels, activating the chakras and creating inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. By the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures had caused the countries to divide.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War begins.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought virtually by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defences had been destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete in retrospect, after 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the line of Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job is to make sure your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while disrupting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this was the WWII North Atlantic campaign.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and peoples began breeding them to more easily obtain milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in wandering herds on hills or other pastures, often tended by goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the shepherds better known today.
Carts had been built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than the rougher roads of the time.
Cross ties were introduced relatively early to hold the local track.
This had become the custom, yet the iron had worn down the wooden wheels of the cart.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known transport was walking, humans began walking vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their overseers, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright by nature.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living green, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we must find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It's pretty clear that the world is changing a lot because of human scientific and technological progress and the problems are getting bigger because of overpopulation and human luxurious lifestyles.
After being passed by congress on July 4th, the written draft signed by congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which was read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap broadside book prints known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of a document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive.
A lot of people didn't think it was a dinosaur because it had feathers and it could fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
It had scaly, clawed feet, laid eggs, and walked on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, either 0 or 1, and those numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terms.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the remains of an open medicine container or toxic household cleaner.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to that specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, insects that have adapted well to being parasitic on humans.
Both killer whales and hoverflies are altruistic, adapting to live in nests or housing sites.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A married couple may decide that it is not in the best interests of them or their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another spouse can take over as the child's parent.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
It is not alone, experimentation and experiments are tests used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's commentaries have been accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found itself cut off from studying Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are typically highly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their generation through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue the range of independent cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were one of the main suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase had used faj, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two tests that marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells alone can be inherited by children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
Examples include visiting, photographing, and learning about the Bornean orangutan.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation everyone, in one way or another, is related and supports the transportation system based on private cars.
Science is now showing that the massive carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states and has been supporting human evolution for the past two million years.
Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In the developed world you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints, why does it fail to function on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic flows are also fairly consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them large areas of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was correct but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.[1] It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids continued to use stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids never exceeded the size and technical excellence of their construction
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communication.
Italian was the everyday language used by most of those who worked in the state while Latin was commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of four or more elements, earth, water, air and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it is also theorized that they change into new materials to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a few trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a very low status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to be near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei which means they can separate with little or no contact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the high ground.
There may be more mare nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out what makes people tick or appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are satisfied when they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what it is about a person that makes them want the things they want and the things in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to lead their former colleagues.
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one would turn into an unrecognizable individual who felt that he had to change everything that the team had done and give it his personal touch.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often led to disputes between the leader and other group members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but the differences are subtle.
Virtual team members often serve as points of contact for nearby physical groups.
They typically have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of true "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which all members report. This invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all resources are used effectively across every functional part of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can occur.
As a result, organizational processes that work together to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and organizational knowledge and learning sharing.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds and tumors will affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and probe brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with attitudes, learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer answers and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These sorts of things have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take their students somewhere they can't go by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing the tour virtually is a great way to illustrate the tour and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old version is kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling errors, the presence of an audience can generally change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog began to work on improving the writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them".[3] The need to engage readers inspires students to write intelligently and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can provide opportunities for students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet material, students can determine their position in the context of others' writing and also outline their own perspectives on related issues (Oravec. 2002)
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada with various art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the northern part is the Muskoka Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and passes through it unscathed.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as a truly Canadian experience for visitors from abroad.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and partly uninhabited wilderness.
For a startling population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and its own continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are separate countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the land and it has flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
There are advantages to wearing a ring (but not a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed through the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it won't be ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
Moroccan sultans rebuilt cities such as Daru I-Badya and named it Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods around the old Medina such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha and various small jewelry, but that is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that engulfed large parts of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing war situation in North Kivu province.
The town is also a site for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to explore Goma.
Combined with its inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city is different from other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones with each one supporting other wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the crown jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance and entrance fee for the park.
It may also be beneficial to one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is a place considered a major focus by many tourists.
The line of buildings that decorate Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering bar chart that is increasingly distinguished by the reflection of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong island is concentrated on land reclaimed along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for historical evidence of the colonization of this region, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world with an area of 80 km (50 mi) stretching from the coastline to as far as inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forest is not just mangroves - it includes some of the last patches of denuded forest covering the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and currently an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer live in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station within the district (across the river) throughout the day, although most especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are always full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most prefectures have the Japan Coast Guard Bus service, which is comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two aisles that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most significant indigenous group occupying the area now referred to as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering crops and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called the "Land of the Indian Giants" was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish had begun a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is very famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here in other years.
For news on the tournament or places to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currencies may be taken; check with the owner in advance to determine what methods of payment are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are common.
Winter is sometimes confusing: temperatures rarely exceed freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons, the amount of rainfall remains more or less constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep a distance of 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
As tame as they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the proper distance.
In addition, be aware that strong odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and always keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement, peaceful assemblies in the town led to the assassination of the most important chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland straddles two harbours.
The North Shore (in the Northern Port district) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas and mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a sometimes crowded family beach with a variety of shops along the shoreline.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a complex beer, but delicious and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are unsure.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A full black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino is high in cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is the standard Belgian equivalent, fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
The reef is visited repeatedly throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Still, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the coast and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally encountered outside these times.
Sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean actively, their main habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Usually travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or a package that combines the hotel and the flight once.
They can also make a booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendments or requests should be made through a travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most troupes consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
There are parties that have special campsites for families with children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as cruising down the ice produces a loud noise to those involved.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions)
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings, to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
However, drunkenness can impair judgment, and all sober gamblers know how important it is not to be affected by alcohol.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or over mountains should think about the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
The icy and snowy road conditions cause low friction and you cannot drive as if you are driving on a normal paved road.
During a blizzard, you can get snowed in in no time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blown snow or through condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow cover and cold are normal in most of the country, and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safari is Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to a journey overland to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment that allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopard seals are sometimes frightened and you'll see these animals better with binoculars.
A walking safari tour (also known as a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") involves an adventure, either for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not take effect until July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for most events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels provide irons and ironing boards for loan, although they are not provided in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Please be careful not to let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, fire).
There are different ways to filter water, certain methods are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in other areas several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests that they are not used to seeing in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infection.
Self-infectious diseases or dangerous animals can injure or kill people forcefully, never confirming as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise in a particular location.
Tourists heading to heavily taxed states can sometimes save money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through remote woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware, steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
Announced speed limits are distinctly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the latter.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is stronger here than other parts along the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastry in Germany is quite tasty, and the pastry in Bavaria is rather sweet and rich, similar to the pastry found in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are a common delicacy, with apples being made into pastries year-round, as well as cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small yet fatty pastry, you can try pastries named after their region of origin such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without qualification, the term means food originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine serves a variety of moderately spicy dishes, typically consisting of the Javanese favourite spices of peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The rack is a support device for the rider's legs that hangs on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but there is a safety risk due to the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is caught on a rack, he will be dragged if the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear boots with flat, rather narrow heels and soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather footrest to drop the saddle if pulled back by the rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous massive walls and granite waterfalls.
Its landmarks include the spectacular views from the summit, and climbers from all over the world continue to carve new routes between its endless walls.
Downhill snow sports that include skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered surfaces with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums" who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has a long history - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, mountaineering being done in steep terrain and requiring harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will cover more distance than on foot - yet very rarely will you get cross-country skiing speed without a heavy backpack in neat lanes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through various countries means having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen Zone, however, functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately, so it can save time, money and documents.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Certain tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
Such definitions have geographic variation where age limits may be less in places like North America than in Europe.
A craft product may be defined as an antique, even if it is younger than the same material produced in a factory.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is important for other professions as well.
Although traditionally, not all Sámi engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but made a living by fishing, hunting and similar activities, keeping reindeer usually as pack animals.
Today there are many Sámi working in modern careers.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assumptions about Roma.
If the country you are going to visit is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, Americans in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
An official announcement is simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are usually fleeting, general and overly brief compared to information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should get professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" might turn up the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will typically last for 2-5 days and will involve role play, extensive first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Voyagers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documentation for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with a gender not stated (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to examine these documents varied widely.
Checks at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-surgical transgender people cannot expect to go through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
A choppy current is a backflow of a wave that breaks on a shore, usually on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the countercurrents are concentrated in some of the deeper parts, and strong currents to deep water may form there.
Most deaths are due to extreme exhaustion from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, the ability to swim back should be no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your experience and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait to be rescued.
