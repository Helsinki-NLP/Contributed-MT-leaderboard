This confirms the popular theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, and it sheds light on other fossil features, such as color and texture.
Scientists say the animal's fur was chestnut-brown above or carotenoid colors below.
The resulting findings shed new light on the origin of birds' feathers.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs are not perfectly formed, called rachis, but have features similar to feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have speculated that rachis may have evolved later than all these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used, not for flight, but to regulate body temperature and for decoration. The researchers suggested that although the specimen is of a small dinosaur, it looks more like the feathers of a large bird than those of a crocodile.
The researchers pointed out that although this was the tail of a small dinosaur, the feathers belonged to something larger, not smaller.

According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "reporters seem to be walking a fine line when it comes to publishing photographs and other material relating to suspected criminals".
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, indicated to the press that no further statements would be made until charges were laid.
This document, according to rumors, deals with border disputes, claimed by Palestine based on borders drawn before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are thought to include the status of Jerusalem as an international city and the issue of the Jordan valley.
Israel wants troops to remain in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, but the Palestinian leadership is agreeing to a five-year limit.
Snipers in an insect-control experiment were closely watched by their Rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness measured.
Volunteers were selected through the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of Parks Conservation and Heritage, who spoke with the NPWS, the four first-time shooters received extensive training in what to do and how to protect themselves.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn into the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which has nine members.
This was the fifth time Martelly entered the CEP in four years.
Last month members of the presidential council recommended the resignation of the ECP as a way of taking steps to move the country forward.
The creation of the Commission became Martelly's response to the anti-government protests that have taken place everywhere since October.
Occasional violent protests have been triggered by failed elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
At least 60 iPods reportedly had a problem with overheating, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry said that it was aware of at least 27 potential nuclear accidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had been reporting 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company said were "not too bad".
The ministry responded that Apple's delay with the report is "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Office reports no damage or casualties in the archipelago.
Again the Pacific Tsunami warning office said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman detained Hong Kong tourists and seized their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages are rescued and at least six are reported to have died so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were quickly freed, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of the elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps by pursuing a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to experience premature labor pains during her off hours.
His research showed that if active ingredients in humans were administered they would accelerate the development of fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" in the flight recorder on Wednesday.
Other boxers also mourned Luna's death.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away two months ago.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as crazy as I am...maybe even crazier...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed prior to the 2010 election, those who favored a democratic Australia increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election that she was promoting the idea that Australia should have a democratic government after the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those who took part in the poll held that view, preferring Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last prime minister.
In another poll, 29 percent of those polled say Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The future Olympic gold medalist was supposed to win the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth games, but because of his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He could not take the medication needed to ease his pain since it is not allowed in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, was able to determine the largest prime number on January 25.
Several people said that they too had commented on the findings after using search engines and computer programs in early February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water and nutrients for proteins and life.
Scientists are eager to understand the formation of the Planets, especially the formation of the Earth, since comets have collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing gay marriage.
He referred to gossip as "political rhetoric and stupidity".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a proposed system by the FAA that would help airlines fly more cheaply, thus saving fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
Using data acquired from satellites, it is more accurate than previous radar systems and enables air traffic controllers on the ground to track aircraft movements and positions with pinpoint accuracy and to provide pilots with accurate information.
No additional transport is being installed at the venue and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, parking and boarding facilities are not available at the venue.
Fear of a lack of transportation made it possible for the match to be forced indoors without team seats.
A study appearing on Thursday in the journal Science reported a new species of bird being discovered in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that in just two generations, what had previously been thought to be a much longer evolutionary process began with a cross between the Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a variety of shapes and sizes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, knitted and woven, pounded with a hammer, or folded into sheets.
It could be made into a sheet, glued onto metal, or covered with glossy pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can demonstrate using red bean juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the solution.
The pH value is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (where H is the pH) ions present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been replaced by electrons (just as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders, and then, with clean hands, knead the mixture into a ball.
The smooth surface of the palms will rub against the surface of the skin, possibly producing a different sensation and forming a shell.
At Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet and a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains on sandwich panels are found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together as a group.
When you telephone someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The spacecraft receives the signals and relays them back to earth as they were, instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere blocks some of the light from reaching our eyes.
It takes a spacecraft more than 100 feet [30 m] into the sky to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has revolutionized the world in amazing ways - most notably by enabling us to move more easily and quickly.
They have given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized predators ranging from rabbits to antelope or deer.
Finally, there are numerous small cats (as well as free-ranging cats) that eat a host of insects such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is that each species has unique eating habits, thus reducing competition.
Lions are very sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs of lions have from one to three males, joined by a female and up to 30 cubs.
The women are usually closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Family lions, such as wolves or dogs, are remarkably similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and they are also very dangerous to their prey.
A well-trained runner, the leopard can climb (but not much), hop, leap long distances and pull five times as much as a healthy human.
The leopard is a member of the same family as lions (genus Panthera), leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the leopard is somewhat different from that of the lion, for the leopard emits a loud, piercing roar.
The ocelot's diet consists mainly of small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists speculate that ocelots follow the scent of their prey, sniffing out the ground where the animals live.
Ocelots hunt for their food by blending in with their surroundings and stalking prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population) is separated from the larger population from which it came (such as by moving across a mountain or a river, or by moving to a different island to make it more difficult to return) it may find itself in a different environment from the one from which it came.
This new environment has diverse resources and much competition, so new resources require new processes or adaptations to existing ones to compete more vigorously than they did in the past.
The world's population has remained virtually unchanged since the beginning of human history.
As time passes, new species adapt to new environments and eventually overlap with existing ones.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups become so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply refers to the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their own food by harnessing the sun's energy through their leaves.
We use trees to make our homes and clothes, and many of the foods we eat come from plants.
The mosasaur was the most advanced animal of its time, and as such, it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with razor-sharp teeth, as well as a number of fangs on the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing that passed through it could possibly escape.
We do not know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue, and it ate lizards, dinosaurs, and possibly other small mammals.
It would have bitten anything that got into the water; even a dinosaur as large as T. rex would have been no match for it.
While we are familiar with many of their dishes, the Romans also have their share of strange or exotic foods, which include wild dog, peacock, lizard, and mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their meals sitting on couches, the rich men liked to feast together sitting on their sides while eating their meals.
The Roman diet would never have included food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians considered temples to be the dwelling place of one god after another.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to please the god by performing rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were once built to connect temple complexes.
At the top of the tower was a special dwelling place for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was of little value.
Hebrew families often engaged in outdoor activities.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were little more than tables set out on the street.
Forests were scarce in the land of Canaan, and wood was expensive.
In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as a murderer, and on his westward journey, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his findings, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although the whole country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, lifestyles, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think of the treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
It is true that there is writing on the back of this piece of paper, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written in small capitals.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote the codex, it was originally about 11 inches by 9 inches (293⁄4 by 243⁄4 cm) in size and was found rolled up for safe keeping.
Hence, it may be that the color was added merely as a symbol of occupation.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the south of France, but the north was not free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and also served with the invaders rather than against them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded Northern France in what was called "Operation Dragon".
Within two weeks American and French troops had liberated northern France and were on their way to Germany.
A culture is a single set of values agreed upon by a number of people living and working as a unit, in a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen, which is similar to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, and this in turn describes population.
Cities and provinces are the building blocks of societies, and culture means passing on knowledge to future generations, storing up knowledge for future use.
When a few exceptional individuals die, they usually leave no record of their achievements.
During the war of independence, the original 13 states formed a loose government, with only Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there were no heads of state or legislatures, it was left to the states, acting independently, to enact all their own laws.
Nor did it have the authority to pass revenue laws and interstate taxes.
Documents required the approval of all countries before they could be finalized and countries underestimated their governing body so much that representatives from it were rarely present.
The Italian and German national soccer teams are the second most successful in the world and won the 2006 FIFA WORLD CUP.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling or motorcycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and auto racing.
Ski jumping is especially popular in the southern regions, where Italians compete in international ski jumping and Olympic events.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the archipelago/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "island federation".
Taiwan was first discovered in the 15th century by European sailors who named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a foothold in northwestern Taiwan, initiating a revolution in Aboriginal grain cultivation by employing Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan along the western and southern coasts, annexing Taiwan as a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In the year 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring sovereignty from Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the outlying buildings have been restored so that visitors can see them in their original state.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most popular motion picture format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film format during the latter part of the motion picture industry's history.
It is still produced today, but even more important is the size of the photographs that were copied as a standard for digital cameras.
Confusingly, the so-called 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the simplest whole number) is therefore three:two.
Many common formats (the APS family of APS formats, for example) match or closely approximate this sharing ratio.
The well-written and often-derided law is a simple guide while maintaining the ideal of good order as a pattern.
It says that the best place is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts, at the height and at the width of the image (as shown in the illustration).
During this time of European upheaval, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under attack.
For thousands of years the Christian religion had united Europe despite linguistic and cultural differences.
The all-pervading force has affected everyone from the emperor to the common man.
One of the basic teachings of Christianity is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church contributions should be used to solve these problems.
The church's millenniums of domination by Rome and its power and wealth made many question the church's credibility.
As the unrest grew, Britain set up a blockade of German troops.
This policy, which has been widely criticized in international law for the past 200 years, has succeeded in excluding military personnel and civilians from benefits.
Britain claimed international waters to prevent ships from entering all areas of the sea, creating dangers even for ships that had no support.
Because little was done to counter this technology, Germany expected the same for its unopposed submarine attack.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of the international community was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations are eager to prevent such things from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to begin work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Long ago China had its own system of time-keeping; each Chinese province, or dynasty, was an independent kingdom.
Moreover, between each dynasty there were periods of regional instability, the best-known of which is the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms period, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times a fierce struggle took place between many aristocrats fighting for the throne.
These three kingdoms were responsible for the most bloodshed; thousands died in the struggle for supremacy in the capital city of Xi'an.
There are various social and political factors, such as the types and forms of governments that exist.
Also after the Reformation jobs were open to all male job seekers allowing the courageous and successful to succeed.
Similarly, in the army, ranks were now assigned according to merit instead of ability.
The French Revolution also triggered mass demonstrations abroad.
Muhammad had a keen interest in spiritual matters, and he often went to meditate in a cave on Mount Noor (the mountain of light) that came to be called "Hira".
The cave itself, which has existed for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's strong beliefs in the occult.
Located on a hilltop to the south of Mecca, this cave is cut off from the rest of the world.
Frankly, it is not easy to find out anything about this subject, even if someone knows that it exists.
All you can see is a cloudless sky and the surrounding mountains, and from there it is virtually impossible to see or hear anything on earth.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians, is one of the greatest monuments ever erected in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
A huge pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and other family members.
The "up bow" is V-shaped and the "down bow" is more like a triangular square, but without one side.
Top means that you should start at the mouth and work your way down, and bottom means that you should start where you are and work your way up.
The higher the pitch, the softer the sound. The lower the pitch, the louder the sound.
Feel free to write down your goals, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be left as they are.
King Louis XVI was greatly alarmed, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 forced to return to Paris from Versailles with a group of market women.
In a car, they traveled back to Paris but were surrounded by a mob who threatened the King and Queen.
The assembled crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows.
One member of the crowd even held up the head of a soldier who had been executed at Versailles and pointed it at the weakened Queen.
The people of the Philippines were already paying the price of the U.S. war of aggression against them.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to pay for a large portion of the costs and interest of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government from the banking houses of Wall Street.
In fact, the large amount of money earned by Filipino workers also contributed to America's prosperity.
To get to know the Templars better one must understand the circumstances that led to the formation of the order.
The period in which it occurred is known as the Middle Ages, periods of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, and then by the Late Middle Ages, which ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of theories of action, from technology-driven or technological essentialism to the deeper theories that human life is driven by a supernatural intelligence that conforms to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Production managers often base their statements on two lines of reasoning: first, that culture and politics are not the only factors influencing production, and second, that production has an impact on society.
To illustrate, one might say that a car is a machine that makes roads.
However, a global road network is not economically viable if it is built with fewer vehicles, so new technologies are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The proliferation of automobiles increases the number of accidents and opens up new avenues of medical treatment and rehabilitation.
Romantic love is a cultural phenomenon, as noted by such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Romanticism had a profound effect on society, and in time, it became a cultural force more powerful than laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in the year 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its reputation declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders no longer brought gifts of silk and spices that cost more than they could be bought in Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the name of fashion changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic script flourished during the 10th, 11th, and 13th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of information, Western styles can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own styles, especially in regard to buttons.
Subsistence farming is a method of farming that aims to produce just enough food for the subsistence needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple method, often organic, using preserved seeds from the environment combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Traditionally, most farmers grew food for themselves, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
People from cultures that are alienated from the mainstream tend to be close-knit because they feel alienated and excluded.
Some cultures may be able to differentiate by age, race, class, location, and / or gender of the victims.
Cultural differences may be influenced by language, religion, political views, sexual preferences, environment, and so forth.
Those belonging to an ethnic minority often identify themselves by their distinctive traits, such as their manner of dress, facial expressions, or body language.
One popular technique used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to take a few depressing experiences of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or unnecessary abuse, deprived of adult contact while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "animal spirits" or hybrids. Some animal spirits have been kept in captivity by humans (often their parents); in other cases this rejection of the child was caused by the parent's rejection of the mentally or physically disabled child.
Single-parent children may have been abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or abandoned.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others were nomads who lived alone in the wild.
When raised by nonhuman animals, this child displays characteristics (within physical limits) similar to its animal caretakers, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While this type of learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable, scaffolding has more to offer.
Scaffolding is not a form of learning but a way to help a learner do something he has never done before, such as use a computer program or some new tool.
Scaffolds can be tangible or virtual, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold like a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffold is an application that helps to ask questions, get the student to think and explain things that may be difficult for him to do alone.
Children are sent to day-care centers for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even forced labor.
No child should ever grow up in a home where he or she is not loved and disciplined, but that is the reality.
We view the Forester Care program as a safe haven for these children.
Our day-care center should provide our children with a safe home, loving caregivers, a solid education, and reliable medical care.
Day-care centers should have all the amenities that children lacked at home.
The Internet combines the whole idea of mass and face-to-face communication.
The unique nature of the Internet leads to the addition of other criteria in terms of usage patterns and methods of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are the main motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) considered "interactive leadership in content" and "continuous engagement" as a new form of motivation, when they studied the behavior of fan-facing websites.
The use of video recording technology has made it possible to capture images of facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
After all, it is said that a person can tell when someone is lying by carefully interpreting facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The Language of the President, pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to evaluate honesty accurately.
He even suggests that animals, such as guard dogs, can imitate human reasoning.
Research over the past two centuries has revealed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Evolution increases genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of genetic variation.
The segregation and recombination of genes back and forth between the two species is quite different in itself.
Outside the savanna grasslands, it is difficult for an animal with a digestive tract like that of humans to satisfy its acids from the available plant resources.
Again, failure to do this can lead to serious problems, such as chronic depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
Organic plant foods would contain proteins that are found in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for animals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, lizards, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides an abundance of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the factors involved, it should not be surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem, just as modern crocodiles do.
Sudden onset of sleep is usually brief (10 minutes to an hour), but then the person falls asleep again.
You can do this by setting your alarm clock to go off at a low level so that you can take a nap without leaving your bed.
If you regularly change the time of your alarm clock while you are sleeping, you may put the clock further away from you and thus be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives to biorhythm include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or a laxative, which induces urination) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
A person's peace of mind is a far cry from the abundance of physical and mental afflictions.
A lighter load allows life's energy to flow more freely. Everyone has the opportunity to find peace and contentment.
Anyone can reach the goal of enlightenment. It may hinder us from thinking that we are capable.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has developed in the romantic way of the mahayana and in many ways from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is, in a sense, simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, which means to focus the mind and follow the path of love in all things.
With Kundalini Yoga the force of Kundalini (the enlightening force) is raised by yoga postures, breathing, vibrations and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the centerpiece of Tibetan meditation, in which the energy field is purified, the chakras invigorated, and one's awareness heightened.
Germany had a regional enemy in World War II, leading to an alliance between the USSR and the USA.
Within two years of the end of the war, they were allies who had become enemies again when the Cold War began.
The war was to be fought for the next 40 years, with real intensity, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense forces were disunited, and all that remained was to concede defeat and reorganize with the help of Romania.
However, these plans came to nothing overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing Poland's eastern provinces in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The navy's mission was to protect the nation's shipping lanes and to interdict enemy shipping.
One indication of this is seen recently in the North Atlantic theater of World War II. The Americans were trying to get men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stem the tide.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain, since it controlled all of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early civilizations and tribes began breeding them for their milk, butter, meat, and hides.
Usually the goats were kept in herds that moved around the hills and pastures, herded by children or younger boys, much like traditional shepherds.
Wagonways were developed in England about the beginning of the 16th century.
Even though the chariots had only outriggers, they allowed the horses pulling them to be faster and to carry heavier loads than the rough roads of the day.
Railroad rails were quickly introduced to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was discovered that the tracks could be made more efficient if they had a metal surface.
Eventually they became the norm, but the iron consumed the wooden wheels of the chariots.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by cast-iron ones, and in 1767, iron rails began to be used throughout the country.
The earliest known transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
It is believed that Australopithecus did not walk upright.
It is believed that bipedalism first appeared in the skeletal remains of Australopithecus, which lived between 4.2 million and 3.9 million years ago, although it has been estimated that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs some 7 million years ago.
We can build a life in harmony with the community, we can join an environmentalist party, and we may even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
However, if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed as a result of advances in science and other fields, and the problems associated with overpopulation and a rising standard of living are intensifying.
After being approved by the Assembly on 4 July, a handwritten document signed by Assembly president John Jancock and by Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few steps to John Dunlap's desk.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "Dunlab broadsides".
The document was first read to the public by John NIxon in the lobby of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy of the document was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The same document reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving copies of the Dunlap Broadsides are the oldest copies of this document.
Fossil scientists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived into modern times - the birds.
Many do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
On the other hand, there are also many references to dinosaur-like birds.
The shrews are shelled and hungry, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all modern computers are based on the binary-number encoding system.
Binary is a computer code that consists of only two digits, 0 and 1.
The symptoms of food poisoning, such as vomiting, may be so subtle that it takes time to identify the real culprit.
A telltale sign of poisoning is an open container of medicine or household cleaner.
Check the label for precise instructions on how to administer the poison.
The word "insect" is used by entomologists to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from the common name of the Bed Bug, which is a common insect that bites humans.
Both the Assassin beetle and the Bed bug are slow-growing, adapted to live in a nest or in the shelter of a food source.
Throughout the United States of America, there are about 400,000 multiple sclerosis (MS) sufferers, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a neurological disease that affects the spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has revealed that women may be twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may feel that it is not right for them or for their unborn child to be raised by themselves.
The couple may choose to adopt a child.
In surrogacy, the surrogate gives up her parental rights so that the other two can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the universe works, and this is often done through the scientific method.
By no means, though, is it limited to that. Research is an experimental endeavor undertaken to test out one or more hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that contribute to scientific discovery.
Scholars and philosophers carefully studied ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science and psychology were widely accepted.
As Greek learning declined, the Western world eventually broke free from Greek philosophy and science.
Normal physiological processes are said to be highly dependent on the existence of a continuum and are governed by the timing of these continuums.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than mere responses to external sounds, are recorded in living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
It is as if living organisms have a built-in clock that keeps time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the ideas that led to the idea that DNA played a role in human genetics.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They double-tagged the DNA in the hot-phosphorus phage or the hot-sulfur protein of the phage.
Mutations in DNA can have a wide range of effects, depending on how the cell divides, as well as on the genetic makeup of the organism and the germ line.
Only mutations in the father's and mother's genes can be passed on to offspring, but mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is for people who want to explore while enjoying the flora and fauna.
Activities at the park include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, and exploring parks and nature reserves.
For example, tourism, photography, and the study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every day, people leave small towns early in the morning, hoping to catch the bus that will take them to their destination.
In this interdependent transportation system everyone is in some way connected to, and supportive of, transportation systems derived from proprietary vehicles.
Science indicates that the current Carbon cycle has profoundly altered the ecological processes that drove human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone in the community has his or her own way of getting from one place to another, and almost everyone complains at one time or another about the buses or other forms of transportation.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear people complain about the quality of water or the condition of collapsed bridges.
Why do work procedures in the transportation industry generate so many complaints, and why do workers miss work every day?
Traffic Analysis is the study of the behavior of individual drivers and what happens when cars collide.
Unfortunately, studying traffic patterns is not easy because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
The good news is that drivers usually see each other when they are traveling; hence, their speed can be calculated.
To get an accurate count, three factors were taken into account: (1) direction, (2) number, and (3) speed.
This relationship plays a key role in planning, designing, and operating road systems.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to do so enabled them to evade predators, find food, and locate mates more easily.
Many insects are fortunate enough to be able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them many small hiding places from predators.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
In the fourth century B.C.E., Greek astronomer Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some insisted that he was right, but many held the opposite view - that the planets, including the sun (or other stars), revolve around the earth.
This seems logical, since the Earth does not seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the longest and largest river in the world - eight times the volume of the second-longest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on earth, some reaching a length of up to 20 miles [6 km].
An estimated 20 percent of all water that enters the world's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of pyramids in stone continued to the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and architectural skill.
The new dynasty of ancient Egypt marveled at the architecture of their ancestors, which by then was over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its official documents and for communication.
Italian is the everyday language used by most who work in the province while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
Vatican City is almost entirely Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about the value of minerals such as gold, silver, and copper from the past, since these can be found in nature too easily to mine with primitive earth tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
These seemed to be the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he suggested that they would evolve into new forms to make up the physical world.
Alloys are simply mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many minerals in the periodic table.
Minerals such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also find alloys of metals with small amounts of nonmetals, such as carbon.
All matter on earth is made up of atoms, tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the space of a match head.
Hence, when the pencil appeared, it became a trusted companion for many people.
Sadly, because of new writing techniques that have been developed, the pencil has been undervalued and largely abandoned.
Today, text messaging has replaced pencil sharpeners as the preferred method of communication.
You never know which keyboard will be left on when something new comes along.
A fission bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus of an atom also releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have nuclei that are so weak that they can break apart with little or no pressure.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is 45 miles [70 km] thick at the base and 60 miles [100 km] thick at the edge.
It is narrow at one end and wide at the other.
Because the shell is so thin, there may be large areas of basalt nearby, which could easily be brought to the surface by lava flows.
Scholarly journals often focus on what makes people happy and what interests them.
This view suggests that people have needs and/ or desires instilled in them as they grow from childhood to adulthood.
He studies the behavior of other people, why they do what they do, and how their environment influences their choices.
The best known are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
When a manager assumes authority over his peers, there are usually two kinds of reactions: There may be a desire to maintain the status quo.
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, disciplining people, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and maintaining independence.
At the other end of the spectrum, a psychopath feels compelled to change everything about the gang and make it his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This attitude often leads to conflicts between employers and coworkers.
Online gangs are treated with the same professional standards as regular gangs, but there is a slight difference.
Active members of the online group often chat when there is an emergency, but they also have a place to meet face-to-face.
They often have more autonomy than the typical gang members since their gangs may meet at different times at intervals that the community leaders will not understand.
The existence of Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109 is one of the unique features of the virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which all members report. An invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why has there been such a long-term training program? One reason is to equip people with organizational knowledge and skills.
If all available resources were channeled into the various departments of an organization, new ideas and methods could be generated.
As a result, organizational processes that work together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new technological way of working to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can improve its performance, its leaders need to promote ideas for improvement and share information and know-how.
Angel (2006) states that the Continuum approach is a method that is being used to help organizations become more efficient.
Studies of cells and the human body have revealed that the brain is able to process information in ways that minimize or eliminate unnecessary detail.
The connection between emotions and behavior is well-established in scientific research.
It has long been known that traumatic brain injuries, concussions, fractures, and solid tumors affect behavior and alter brain function.
Advances in modern technology make it possible to see and study the structure and function of the brain as never before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and the materials to build visual devices that help us understand the workings of our minds.
Although the letters Al are widely used in science fiction, the same letters are used in a branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
AI research involves designing machines that perform tasks without the use of hands that require intelligence.
Examples of this include controlling the ability to answer customer questions, the ability to write, hear what is said, or recognize facial expressions.
Such subjects have become areas of study in their own right, focusing on how to deal with real-life problems.
AI systems have been used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any class. Often the teacher wants to take his students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
With the advent of computer technology, students can explore museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy the beauty of nature right in the classroom.
Going on a field trip together and in the air is a great way to reminisce about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet school in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the capital, every year the website is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as a reference book.
Blogging helps students improve their handwriting. They often start off poorly and don't care much about grammar and spelling, but knowing that what they write is being seen by others often makes them change their handwriting.
Since students are so important, a person who writes an opinion piece on a social networking site should do so in a way that will not draw undue attention to himself.
Moreover, social networking "encourages students to be open-minded and to have a better understanding of the world around them".
Writing is a practice that encourages cooperation, and it helps students to learn beyond a typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and open-minded; by commenting on online content, students can understand where they stand in relation to other students and evaluate their own opinions on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, with art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther north are the Niagara Falls and to the south are the lesser-known wonders of its Muscogee beauty and beyond.
All of this and more is typical of Ontario as described by non-Canadians.
The vast northern regions are sparsely populated and are largely uninhabited.
A demographic comparison shocks many: There are more black Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of these, and it is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent states, or dependencies, of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, especially to Coromos and Mayotte.
European invasions and conquests began in the 15th century, a period that also saw Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama find his way from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers indicate whether they are married, regardless of their actual marital or single status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not one that shows off luxury).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead them to view certain behavior as harassment and to view being followed, touched, and so on as normal.
If you want to say no to a man, do so in a serious and forthright manner (although customs may differ, it would not be right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the tenth century, and it was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenids as the port of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan ruler rebuilt Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who had established their business there.
Casablanca is one of the most unpleasant shopping cities in all of Morocco.
Outside the old medina, it is easy to find markets selling traditional Moroccan wares - carpets, ceramics, leather goods, wooden smoking sticks, and colorful jewelry - all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Congo Free State located in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was devastated when ash from the Nyiragongo volcano flooded many of that city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, if you plan to travel outside of it, do some research to find out what the fighting is like in North Kivu.
The town is also home to the Nyiragongo volcano and to some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike) to get around in Goma. The price (local standard) is 500 Congolese dollars for a short trip.
In addition to its isolation, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a ghost town, although its beauty attracts many tourists, and it has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was added to the world endangered species list, because of its desert soil.
Henry Louis Gates' frequent stop in this city was for a PBS program entitled Wonders of the African World.
This city is unique in that it is the most Arabic-speaking city in Africa.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles [19,500 sq km] and is divided into 14 ecological zones, each containing a different animal.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in other South African parks, there are daily animal control activities and an entrance fee.
It may also be helpful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gave its name to the bay of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
A display of the skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong was likened to a glowing wooden chart that makes them stand out against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Much of the prosperity of Hong Kong's island cities is built on reclaimed land on the southern shores.
This is the area that British privateers claimed as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of early plunder, this is a good place to start.
The largest coastal mangrove belt in the world is that of the Sundarbans, over 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline touching the edges of Bangladesh and out beyond India.
The Sandarbans is now a UNESCO world heritage site, and part of it is in the Sandarbans National Park in India.
The forest is not just a wetland of mangroves - it includes some of the last remaining old-growth forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by rainforest.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer have already been seen in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station from various towns (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthan, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Buses traveling between provinces are often crowded, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Many prefectures have small Japanese buses that are sturdy and comfortable.
Taxis are convenient and quick to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The cable-stayed Oyapock River Bridge spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Geoges de I'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The twin towers are 275 feet [83 m] high, 1,200 feet [378 m] long, and have double galleries 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the entry and exit points in Brazil will be completed.
The Guarani' were the dominant indigenous group in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was inhabited by such ethnic groups as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, also known as "The Giant of the Indies", came into existence as a result of the combined efforts of Spanish conquistadores and local natives.
The Spanish were the first of a series of conquests that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous identity and culture.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest race of all is held in December at the Las Cañitas racetracks.
You can see a few festivals here, at other times of the year.
For sports news and for obtaining admission tickets to see Polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money is transferred to the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are widely accepted in wallets and Stanley bank cards, and American dollars are also occasionally accepted.
For outlying islands, payment by credit card may be refused, although British and U.S. dollars may be accepted; so it is best to check in advance with the authorities as to which method of payment you would like to use.
It is difficult to change money in the Falklands once you leave, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, when it is winter north of the Equator, it is summer there, alternately.
Montevideo has a tropical climate; during the summer months, temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winters can be relatively mild: temperatures rarely drop below freezing but winds can cause temperatures to drop below the thermometer.
There is no such thing as a dry season or a hot season: the amount of rain falls more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in zoos see humans regularly, we should remember that they are only social animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and grizzlies and 25 yards [25 m] from other wildlife!
Although they may seem harmless, bison, elk, moose, and bears, as well as other large animals, can attack humans.
Tourists are injured every year because of not keeping the prescribed distance. The animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that some odors attract wolves and other wildlife, so try to avoid carrying or cooking spices and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one of the British ships were sunk, and about 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the Mau Mau uprising, they disrupted a peaceful meeting in the town, resulting in the death of General Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to Auckland's two harbors and three prominent landmarks.
The northern coast of the North Harbour region is on the Pacific Ocean, and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They may be all sandy beaches rather than safe swimming spots, and many also have shade from mangroves.
Beaches along Tamaki Drive at Waitemata Harbour Station, in the outer suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These coastal communities are full of families with luxurious shops lining the beaches.
The local specialty is "Number One", a light beer with a sweet, refreshing aroma.
You can drink a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
Tap water is fine to drink, but if you are afraid, it is easier to find bottled water.
To Australians, the concept of "pure" coffee is a foreign concept. A short black "espresso", a cappuccino comes filled on top with a foam (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate is a typical Belgian beverage. Fruit drinks are expensive but delicious.
Millions of people visit the reefs year-round, but they rarely cause any harm.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all traffic signals, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish can be found on beaches or in rivers where other fish swim from October to April, but they can also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely bite humans, and most shark species swim away in panic.
Saltwater crocodiles rarely live in oceans, but they do in rivers that empty into the sea north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives a visitor peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Tourist accommodations are usually in hotels, but you may be able to arrange for other types of accommodations, such as camping.
Travel agencies may offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or flights and accommodations.
They can reserve a place for you in case you need to obtain travel documents (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made in advance with the travel agent, not with the hotel.
At some festivals, dozens of promoters sit on the main stage, and they say that they enjoy the music.
If you want to get closer, you have to enter the camp quickly, and then you have to get closer to where the music is played.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have ceased, there may be parts of the drama that will continue to play music until midnight.
Some events have designated playgrounds for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, find out where the log cabin is located, as crossing the ice causes excessive noise to those who are most disturbed by it.
St. Petersburg's cruise ships allow visitors to enter the city without a visa (but first find out how they get there).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They have food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and stay in their seats.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, overdrinking is addictive, and experts in gambling know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high altitudes or traveling over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of encountering snow or ice.
When it snows, the roads are slippery and slippery, and it is difficult to drive on slippery surfaces.
In winter, too much snow to disturb you can fall in an instant.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow or ice on the windshields or by the presence of dew or snow on the car windows.
But snow and ice are frequent occurrences in some parts of the world, making travel safe and enjoyable throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and a delight for many visitors.
The word safari in common usage refers to a round-the-world trip to see Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially giraffes.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach your car, and wearing protective gear is one of the best ways to see them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often so shy that they become too conspicuous to see with binoculars.
Another way to see wildlife without a car is to hike in the bush for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you had already bought your plane tickets and paid for your accommodations before the cancellation was announced, you would be in for a surprise.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the game will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Yen, with standard tickets costing up to 7,000 Yen.
Heating wet clothes can help dry them. Most hotels have an iron and an ironing board, which can be borrowed, even if one is not in the room.
Without an iron, and perhaps not wanting to wear burned socks, you can dry with hair, if available.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (which can cause a relapse, or worse, a burn).
There are many ways to purify water, but some are more effective than others at removing harmful contaminants.
In some areas water needs to be boiled for only a minute, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to the regions they have left.
Microbes can spoil food, make you sick, or worse, damage your skin, spread toxins, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or ferocious animals that can violently injure or kill humans, rarely qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to buy goods without paying duty and other local charges.
Tourists who travel to countries with high taxes sometimes manage to save quite a bit of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The drive between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging part of the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, occasionally cutting through dense forest.
If you are not used to driving on country roads here, stay calm: hills, narrow streets, and curves abound.
The speed limits mentioned are lower than the previous categories - as much as 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
I would also like to note, however, that mobile phone coverage is stronger here than in other areas along this route, for example Pennsylvania Wilds.
German food is delicious, and in Bavaria, it is rich and varied, much like its neighbor to the north, Austria.
The delicacy is known for its berries, with apples baked in flour year-round, and cherries and plums, especially ripe in summer.
Many German pastries are also flavored with almonds, nuts, and other nuts.
Perhaps you prefer to eat small but rich, tasty dishes called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Its diet consists mainly of herbs and spices, supplemented with meat or vegetables.
It can be "hard" or "wet" depending on the type of water used.
In the interior of South India and Pakistan, yogurt is often served as curry; in North India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut sauce is the main ingredient.
With some 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a blanket term covering a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, it refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese food has become a staple of the archipelago and includes nuts, chili peppers, shrimps (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of other spices.
A stirrup is a piece of equipment that attaches a rider's legs to his body.
They calm the rider but there may be concern over the possible danger that the rider's feet may be kicked.
If a rider's legs get entangled, he may be dragged by the horse while it is in motion.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a slippery, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather strap to fall from the seat when pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's forerunner of mountaineering, known as the Yosemite of North America, has a variety of rock walls and cliffs.
Rock climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes through the seemingly endless walls.
Skiing, which includes cross-country skiing and snowboarding, is a popular activity that involves walking barefoot on icy surfaces or on boards strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a great experience for tourists, many of whom, sometimes known as "ski bums", plan entire vacations around skiing at a resort of their choice.
The practice of cross-country skiing has a long history - cave paintings depict cross-country skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first club for the sport was formed by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking skiing: Also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related to but separate from alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being practiced at greater depths and requiring sturdy skis and matching boots.
You can see the ski slope as if you were climbing a mountain.
Under the right conditions, it can cover somewhat longer distances than walking - but sometimes it can even outrun a skier without a heavy pack and on well-maintained trails.
Europe is the world's smallest continent, but it is home to many sovereign states, and when things are going well, travel between them often requires visas and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this regard.
If you live in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a permit in each Schengen country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a valuable asset, and some tax authorities even classify items that are more than 100 years old as such.
The definition varies from place to place, with the age limit simply being shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Artifacts can be as valuable as artifacts of the past, even if they bear little resemblance to more recent mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is important among the Sami and traditions surrounding the trade are also important to many who have other occupations.
Although traditionally, not all Sami were in the reindeer herding business at large, but made a living from fishing, hunting and the like, they had reindeer mostly as pets.
Nowadays most Sami work in modern jobs. Tourism has an important income in Sapmi, a Sami area.
Although widely used, often among non-Romanies, the term "Gypsy" is considered derogatory mainly because of its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country to which you are going has a travel warning, your travel and health insurance may not be valid.
You may also be able to seek assistance from foreign governments, but their help is mainly directed to citizens of their own country.
As an example of the first, Native Americans in the Middle East may experience a different environment than Europeans or Arabs.
There are statements that merely summarize the nature of each political issue.
The opinions expressed are often incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, incomplete
Extreme weather is the most common characteristic of any extreme weather event that can cause devastation, social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in many forms, depending on local conditions and wind patterns.
High winds, hail, torrential rains, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and typhoons.
Regional and seasonal climates include frost, snow, sleet, and hail.
Travelers are being warned to be aware of weather-related hazards that could affect their travel plans.
Anyone contemplating a visit to a country considered a war zone needs professional instruction.
An Internet search for "Hostile environment course" may bring up the address of a local company.
The course covers all the above points in detail, often including practical suggestions.
A vocational course usually lasts from two to five days and includes basic skills, often first aid in health care and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
