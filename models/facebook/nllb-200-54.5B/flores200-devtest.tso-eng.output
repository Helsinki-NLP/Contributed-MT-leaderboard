This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an idea that is now widely accepted, but it also provides further evidence that these extinct creatures lacked the ability to produce pigment and pigment.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were reddish brown above and grayish or yellowish below.
The findings also shed light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers have a shallower growth, called a rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers - scales and crests - researchers have speculated that the rachis may have been a late evolutionary development.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or propulsion. Researchers suggest that although it is the tail of a small dinosaur, the pattern suggests large feathers, not small ones.

The Crown Prosecution Service, which handles sentencing, informed the press that no comment would be made until the verdict was announced.
The document, allegedly, will also include the contentious issue of borders, which the Palestinians want based on the 1967 borders before the Mideast war.
Other topics to be discussed are the future of the two-nation holy city of Jerusalem and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that troops remain in the valley for only ten years if an agreement is reached but the PA agrees to withdraw from the area for only five years.
People who shot animals on the recommendation of a pesticide expert had to be closely monitored by animal professionals, since the recommendation was monitored and tested.
In conjunction with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., trained volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Park Conservation and Heritage who works with the NPWS, the first four shooters selected for the first shoot were given extensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly was sworn in by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission suggested writing a letter of resignation to the CEP as a prerequisite for elections to go ahead in the country.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by failed elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
At least 60 iPods were reported to have malfunctioned because of overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 nuclear accidents.
Just last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional devices that were overheating, which the company called "unintentional".
The department responded by calling Apple's suspension "absolutely reprehensible".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands disaster relief office reported no damage in the country.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of an impending tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman kidnapped Hong Kong delegates by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the delegates with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far six have died.
Six of the abductees, including children and adults, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers replaced the elderly woman because she preferred the smaller house.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and trained for a medical career.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching the subject of premature birth during his vacation.
His research showed that if the hormone were injected, it would cause the fetus' lungs to grow rapidly to their full size.
Xinhua reported that a government investigation found two 'black boxes' of the plane's flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers expressed their affection for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was a Queen of the Highest Order. My first patron. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. It was special like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as different in a good way as I am...maybe more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
In a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 election, those who favored a republican Australia had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated in a 2010 election that she hoped Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
On the other hand, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic soon, but 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
An Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his concerns, his fitness is being questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary pain medication because it was banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever on January 25.
This was confirmed by a series of hardware and software tests in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Meteorites were the source of the water cycle and of the organic compounds that could make up the proteins needed for life.
Scientists yearn to understand the inner workings of the solar system, especially the origin of our planet, which began when asteroids slammed into the Earth thousands of years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the news channel as "politically correct and aggressive".
He is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA certifies will enable airlines to fly shorter routes while saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing air pollution.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to radar-based technology so that navigation instruments can track the aircraft more accurately and provide the pilot with more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and the underground stops at Wembley, and there are no car parks and no alternative transport facilities in the area.
Fears of a lack of transportation led to the idea of staging a match indoors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal science reported on the evolution of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species appeared in just two generations, although it was believed that the species was long-lived, as a result of a cross between the Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and an imported cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be transformed into many shapes and forms, and it can be bent into smaller pieces.
It can be made into thin wire, which can be bent or twisted into loops, beaten with a hammer, or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, cast into other metals, and so thin that it was used to decorate illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can use red cabbage juice as a reference.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value depends on the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being measured.
Hydrogen ions are protons replaced by electrons (since Hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two ingredients together, and using clean, moist hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will mix with the skin, creating a pleasant aroma and a shelllike texture.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were latrines in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, latrines were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and quickly displays it on the ground.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks out light and other forms of visible light.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] in orbit to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in unprecedented ways. One of its greatest contributions has been to provide easier and faster transportation.
It brought us a train, a car, and plenty of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on everything from rabbits to deer or antelope.
Finally, there are the many small cats (including house cats) that feed on countless small creatures, such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the name cheer, a special act performed by each cat without competition.
Lions are gregarious cats that live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
It is not uncommon for lionesses to form inbreeding pairs, forming large family groups filled with females.
Like hyenas or dogs, these lionlike predators (but not other big cats) hunt in packs and kill their prey.
The leopard is versatile, able to climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and with strength three times that of the strongest man.
The leopard belongs to the same order (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and tigers.
A leopard's roar is not like that of a full-grown lion but like the howl of a man in full flight.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds.
Scientists speculate that ocelots track or locate prey by scent.
The ocelot hunts by matching its movements with those of its prey so that it can catch prey more quickly later.
When a small group of organisms (a few species) is separated from its home range, (such as by moving from another mountain or valley, or to a new island for easier travel back) it tends to find itself in a different environment than it was before.
The new environment has different equipment and different competitors, so the new animals will need different equipment or adaptations in order to compete or will need more strength than they had in the past.
The older animals have not changed at all, they still have to adapt to the same environment.
In time, as the new arrivals adjust to their new environment, they gradually become isolated.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will seem so different that they can be called distinct groups.
This process is called speciation, or the production of new species, and it is an inevitable consequence of the theory of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and plants absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, what they exhale).
Plants convert sunlight into food through photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We use plants to make our homes, clothes, and most of our food; without them, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the most aggressive predator of its time, and it was fearless, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as additional ones in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing could slip out of its grasp.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included giants, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly lizards.
And it attacked anything that got into the water; yet a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not stand up to it.
While many of their foods may be familiar to us, the Romans also had some strange and exotic foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the dormouse
One difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals on couches, the rich often had banquets where they sat side by side and shared their meals.
The ancient Roman diet would not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted garlic.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built elaborate temples that they viewed as the dwelling place of a god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to care for the needs of the gods by performing rituals and festivals.
Each had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was the god's special sanctuary.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not considered valuable.
Hebrew family life was largely outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open-air counters overlooking the street.
There are few forests in the land of Canaan, so wood is expensive.
In Norse accounts Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled farther west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences among the peoples, rulers, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That, however, is not true. Neither is what is written after that letter a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote this, it is known that early in its existence, a large parchment scroll (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was kept.
Hence, it is likely that the writing was inserted merely as a token.
The day of the invasion and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, French citizens who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and who worked with the invaders rather than against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an operation code-named "Operation Dragoon"
Within just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Social cohesion is a common culture shared by the largest group of people who live and work together, the community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning virtue, related to civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, and in some sense describing the greatness of a population.
City-states are typical examples of nations. A culture of coexistence indicates the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a core of culture that has maintained an appropriate diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and fail to achieve the same level of recognition as successful civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen nations first set up a weak government - with the National Assembly as its only component - under the Covenant of the League of Nations.
The Council of State had no power to levy taxes, and, because there was no branch of national government or judiciary, it depended on the uncooperative federal authorities to enforce all its laws.
But it did not have the power to interfere with government taxation and finance between nations.
The treaty required absentee ballots from all nations before it could be ratified, and the nations underestimated the central government whose representatives were often absent.
The Italian national soccer team, along with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, handball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports, popular in the northern provinces, have Italians competing in national championships and the Olympics.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan consists of, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilhal Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to change the corn-growing habits of the natives but hiring Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas but declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the standard for photography on earth is 35mm, which was the film size used at the end of the motion picture era.
It is still produced today, but more important is the aspect ratio that has been transferred to the various image sensors of the digital camera.
The 35mm version is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
A ratio of this sort (dividing by 12 to get the simplest ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Most common types (types of the APS family, for example) are at or near this unit average.
The misused and often ridiculed principle of prioritization is a simple guideline for making adjustments while maintaining consistency in an image.
It states that the best location for a valuable object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three of equal width and length (see illustration).
At this point in Europe's history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under attack.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united the kingdoms of Europe despite language and cultural differences.
Its influence has affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One basic Christian belief is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The center of church authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this expenditure of power and money caused many to question whether this belief was achievable.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began blockading German shipping.
The strategy proved successful, with the blockade of vital military and civilian facilities, even though this was in violation of universally accepted international law codified in treaties two centuries earlier.
Britain dredged international waters to prevent any ships from entering any part of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As if this tactic had not worked, Germany expected the same in its unrestricted submarine warfare.
By the 1920's, the prevailing view of communities and races was that war was unnecessary and divisive.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar fate in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking time, each part of China or dynasty being a separate kingdom.
The best-known of these was the Three Kingdoms period that occurred during the 60-year period between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these times there was a fierce struggle among the many aristocratic families who fought for the secret of rulership.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in a struggle for control of the vast palace complex at Xi'an.
There are many social and political benefits, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from an all-powerful government to a republic, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution jobs were open to all male job seekers provided they had a strong desire and were able to advance.
Some joined the military because instead of ranks being based on class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired numerous groups of foreign slave laborers to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was interested in more than the mundane aspects of life as a child. He would often go to the cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (the light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a remarkable picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find them at all, even if one knows that they exist.
Nothing can be seen but a cloudless, clear sky above and many mountains nearby. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from deep inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Tower is just one of many pyramids erected in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has a number of pyramids (of which the pyramid is the largest), a number of tombs, a number of temples, and a huge Beast.
A huge pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
The "up bow" is in the shape of a V, and the "down bow" is in the shape of a paper clip or a square box.
High means that you start at the tip and push the bow, and low means that you start at the tail (where your hand holds the bow) but pull the bow.
Pushing the bow produces a low-pitched sound, while pulling it produces a high-pitched but forceful thrust.
Feel free to write your own symbols in pencil, but remember that the printed bow symbols are there for musical purposes, so they should generally be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Queen Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women in the marketplace to return to Paris from Versailles on October 16, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a cheering crowd shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forces the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
On one occasion a member of the mob decapitated a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The cost of the U.S. government's war in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to finance a large portion of the money, and the interest on the money they promised to pay went in the name of the Philippine government to Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the enormous revenues generated by the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people could make up the basic income of the U.S. government.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that influenced the formation of this group.
The period during which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages but was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which generally ended about 1500.
Technocentrism is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of applied theories, ranging from the technological innovation or usefulness of technology to the hypothesis that humanity's future is controlled by a superintelligence that conforms to scientific principles and is demonstrated by technology.
Many definitions of measurement by technology share two common assumptions: that technological development follows a pattern largely unaffected by cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, "affects" people culturally, rather than being driven by human behavior.
To illustrate, one might say that a car makes roads.
However, the national road network has little economic impact on automobiles, so new industrial processes are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
More traffic also means more traffic accidents, prompting the development of new health-care strategies to help heal damaged bodies.
Romanticism had much to do with cultural relativism, derived from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the spirit of Romanticism, the environment shaped the people, but with the passage of time customs and traditions associated with that environment developed, and these, in harmony with the social environment, were superior to mere rules.
Just as Paris was renowned as the fashion capital of the world during this period, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its reputation declined in the twelfth century, largely because the Khurussades returned with gifts of silk and spices of greater value than those available in Byzantine markets.
During this period the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the coloring was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communications, western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the great advances of the so-called Crusader period was the introduction of buttons for tying clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing only enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple, often low-chemical, method of using local seeds in combination with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and that is still the case in many developing lands.
Ethnic groups from a dominant culture unite people who feel left out by society's norms and allow them to build their own identity.
Cultural groups from a larger culture may be differentiated by the age, race, class, geographic location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a cultural group from a larger culture are language, architecture, religion, politics, customs, geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural group that has broken away from the dominant culture often express their membership in distinctive and symbolic ways through the use of styles, including fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the value of socializing is to consider a number of tragic cases of children who, because of neglect, hardship, or deliberate mistreatment, were deprived of social contact by their parents while growing up.
Some children are referred to as "caged adults" or grow up in isolation. Some adult children are caged by people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to parental denial of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who grow up in detention may have experienced extreme child abuse or exploitation before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a captive infant develops behaviors (physiologically) much like those of its caretaker, such as fear of or aversion to humans.
While activity-based learning should make learning easier and more enjoyable, learning with support is even more beneficial.
Supportive learning is not a method of learning but a supportive aid for people who are in a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new job.
Supportive learning can take place on-line or in person, in other words, the teacher is a supportive type of instructor but so is the help provided by Microsoft Office.
Computer-Assisted Learning is embedded in a computer program and is designed to ask, motivate, and explain procedures that may be problematic for the student to solve on his own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of nourishment, care, and education, but such things happen.
We view the Adoption System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, good education, and reliable health care.
Foster care must provide all the necessities that were not available in the home where they were married.
The Internet includes social networking sites for many and for many.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional categories of use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" are estimated to be the most important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Human involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as areas of new influence by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated reader reaction to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in facial recognition, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell when someone is lying by carefully reading facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, illustrated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to analyze what comes directly from the heart.
He even suggested that this ability to perceive human behavior could be inherited by domestic animals, such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and active.
Mutations increase genetic variation and selectively remove it from the mix of variants used.
Separating and combining but making a distinction back and forth between the two mixtures of each race.
Out on the coast, it is difficult for an animal with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain all the amino acids it needs from plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has terrible consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and finally death.
A ready source of plant protein would be the leaves and beans, but these are too dry for animals like us to digest unless cooked
In contrast, animal foods (ants, worms, and eggs) are not only digestible but also rich sources of protein with essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that beach chimpanzees do today.
Interrupted sleep is a pattern of deliberately getting up at your normal bedtime and then going to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes)
This can easily be done by using a quiet alarm clock to keep you awake but not completely awake.
If you find yourself putting your alarm clock back during sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other aspects of the natural cycle involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to cause increased urination) before bedtime, which may make it necessary to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace of mind one enjoys is directly related to the amount of stress one endures physically and emotionally.
The lower the stress, the better the quality of life. Each person has the potential for attaining complete peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is within the reach of everyone. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own pressure and wrong inclinations.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been enriched by the Mahayana model of love and also by the Indian system of Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the fundamental way - acceptance of love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is revived by yoga postures, breathing exercises, certain religious expressions, and mental visualization.
A centerpiece of Tibetan meditation is Shambhala Yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an awakening to enlightenment occurs.
Germany was an international enemy in World War II, which resulted in the alliance between the USSR and the U.S.A. With the end of the war the clash of systems, systems and cultures resulted in the collapse of states.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would be fought outright, with combined armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish armies had been scattered, and the only hope was to withdraw or regroup but with a firm base in Romania.
These plans, however, were suddenly rendered unworkable when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and occupied Belarus and Ukraine after invading Poland's eastern provinces in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo shipping is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the navy has historically been to ensure that your nation can evacuate your people and property and, at the same time, to counter the enemy's ability to evacuate his.
One outstanding recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to get men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, with its submarines, tried to prevent a collision.
If the blockade had not worked, Germany could have conquered Britain as easily as it conquered Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In ancient cultures they were kept for their milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats usually lived as a nomadic herd on hills or other pasture lands, sometimes tended by shepherds who, like the average shepherd, were mostly children or adolescents.
Stagecoaches had been built in England about the beginning of the 16th Century.
Although the roadbed was made of smooth-surfaced wooden planks, it allowed the horses pulling the chariots to travel faster and to carry heavier loads than they could on the rough roads of the day.
Crossties were soon being used for road surfacing, but it gradually became apparent that metal surfaces would be more practical.
These came into use, but the iron easily damaged the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and by 1767 all-iron rails were in use.
The earliest form of transport was walking, with humans first walking upright millions of years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedalism is found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can adopt a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to reduce future suffering.
However, if we are not to look for short-term solutions, we need to get to the root of the problems, and we need to root them out.
Clearly, the world has changed as a result of advances in science and technology, and the problems have increased as a result of population growth and increased living standards.
After approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's nearby printing shop.
Overnight 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.

The ultimate goal of science is to discover scientifically how the world works, and this is the basis for much scientific research.
However, hypothesis is not the only test, and a hypothesis is an experiment used to eliminate a suspect substance or substances, to ask questions, to test, and to conduct scientific research.
Natural historians and philosophers are paying close attention to ancient writings and especially to the Bible in Italian.
All of Aristotle's ideas about science, including logic, were widely accepted.
As Greek knowledge became less and less important, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophy and science.
Many have come to realize that the way people think and behave most of the time depends on external and internal factors, such as the passage of time.
Natural processes, which are much more than reactions to what needs to be done, have been documented in many forms of life, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The mechanisms that govern the timing of natural phenomena operate automatically and will continue to do so regardless of the forces that govern them.
Hershey and Chase's hypothesis was one of the first to show that DNA is genetic material.
Harshey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They suggested two other labels, either phosphorus-bearing DNA or sulfur-bearing protein.
Mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the gene mutation, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only changes in the sex cells can be passed on to offspring, while changes elsewhere cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts tourists who want to experience nature, including the flora and fauna of the forest.

Each morning, they drive from the small towns to their work sites and are passed by other vehicles belonging to those who work in the area.
In a world of ever-changing transportation systems, everyone is in favor of human-powered transportation.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has removed the conditions on earth from the stable foundation that supported human evolution millions of years ago.
Everyone contributes to the community and uses the same transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In wealthier lands, people rarely complain about clean water or falling balls.
Why do public transportation systems provoke such complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent?
Collision avoidance is the study of how drivers and vehicles travel between two locations and how they interact.
Unfortunately, learning how to handle a collision is difficult because you cannot reliably model the driver's behavior.
Interestingly, it is not uncommon for drivers to react similarly; that tends to equalize the collision and can be expressed mathematically in a less precise way.
To visualize the flow pattern of a traffic jam, three key parameters have been coordinated: (1) flow, (2) mass, and (3) speed.
This cooperation is vital to the planning, construction, and operation of the interchanges.
Insects are among the earliest animals to take to the air, using flight to escape predators and to find food and mates.
Many insects are blessed with wings that cover their entire bodies.

People have known about such basic chemicals as gold, silver, and copper since very early times, because they all occur in nature in their natural state and are often easily mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle came up with the idea that all things were composed of one or a combination of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These closely resembled the four states of matter (respectively): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Alloys are basically made by combining two or more metals, and there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals.
You can also make alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of methane, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms They are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Hence, when the pencil was invented, it was a popular companion.

People now type messages on computer screens, away from the pencil sharpener.
You may wonder what the keyboard will be like when a new one arrives.
A fission bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like turning a heavy chariot that is hurtling up a hill, nuclear fission occurs again, and that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can be broken apart with little energy
The lunar crust is the outermost layer of the Moon's crust.
The impact radius was about 45 miles [70 km] in the near direction and 60 miles [100 km] in the far direction.
It is narrow at the bottom of canyons and rugged at higher elevations.
Because of the narrowness of the crater rim, there could be many craters on the near side, making it easy for the mantle to slide off.
The idea behind texting is to find out what people want to believe or what interests them.
This view suggests that what they bind and/ or desire within themselves as they mature is what grows.
This theory looks at What makes other people want the things they want and What factors in their environment might make them want or not want certain things.
Two popular theories of texting are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzber's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, one of two attitudes can develop when leaders begin to dominate their peers: The other side is trying to remain "one of the boys".
This type of leader fails to make unpopular decisions, discipline, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable for their actions.
On the other hand, the individual is transformed into an outsider who feels compelled to change everything about the group and to do his own thing.
In the final analysis, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This sometimes creates tension between the leader and the group.
Online clubs are considered similar to high-functioning and traditional clubs, but there are a few differences.
Online communities serve as a meeting place.
They are more open-minded than traditional groups because these groups can meet at different times in countries where local leaders are not easily understood.
The existence of a true "invisible community" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is another unique feature of an online community.
"Invisible group" A group leadership in which all members are subordinate to one another. An invisible group sets the rules for the members of the group.
Why would an organization want to establish a time-consuming routine for starting a study group?
When all resources are put to good use in the organizational functioning of a department, creativity and wisdom can be shown.
As it turned out, a cooperative agency system to overcome this barrier could lead to a new approach to customer service.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and the sharing of organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) defines a continuous process as a process that can be used to achieve a goal.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for a specific hypothesis to be used in the investigation of cognitive processes.
The connection between mental illness and behavior has inspired scientists to further their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, skin rashes, and tumors affect behavior and bring about changes in thinking patterns.
The advent of new technology makes it possible to observe and investigate previously unknown brain structures and processes.
This provides a wealth of detail and copying tools that help us to understand the processes in our own mind.
Although AI is a subset of science fiction, AI forms an integral part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligence applied to machines.
Research in AI involves designing machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behaviors.
Examples include control, organization, and orderliness, the ability to answer customers' questions, and even to recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
These have been subdivided into various beliefs, all aimed at providing solutions to life's problems.
AI is often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in home computers and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of every classroom. Often the teacher prefers to take his students to a place where the bus cannot reach.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, in which students can explore a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a work of art while sitting with fellow students.
Talking about the trip online is also a way to focus on the trip and share experiences with future travel companions.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old ones are put online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help improve students' spelling Although students sometimes start a blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often important observers, the blogger works to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
And blogging "motivates students to become familiar with what's happening around them". The need to post information on an Internet site with an audience influences students to be intelligent and entertaining (Toto, 2004).
Blogging promotes a spirit of cooperation and encourages students to learn outside the classroom.
Effective use of blogs "can help students develop critical thinking skills; by commenting on online content, students can articulate their position in relation to others' writing and opinions on issues (Oravec, 2002).
