Although an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, it has not yet been clearly demonstrated that there are adequate drugs to treat an existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated that it had less benefit in preventing death than desired.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a benchmark, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they play, can be better served by implementing significant changes to our organization than by withdrawing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was brownish-brown on the upper side, with a light orange color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but display other characteristic features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that came after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impressions.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of lots of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke billowing from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners and not drink tap water.

Dr Tony Moll discovered the presence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
"In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very disturbing and worrisome because of the very high mortality rate"".
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group of people with TB still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is compatible with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushind of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating which candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of counted and duly authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing the photos can be harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that 'journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.'"
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the prosecution, told reporters it would not comment further until charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to accept this presence for only five years.
The hunters taking part in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by foresters, the test monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Hunting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, based on the Sport Hunting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director for Conservation and Park Heritage at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety training and coaching.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread antigovernment protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company said were "not serious"".
"The minister responded, saying Apple's delay was 'truly regrettable.'"
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to research preterm labor.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman".
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed 'Gold Dust,' commented that 'Luna was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place.'"
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her view, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those polled agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, as well as three relay events, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to control his pain, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and lowering carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and relay more precise information to pilots.
No additional transport is available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley and parking and public transport related parking facilities are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, in the absence of the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of patterns, rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It could be made very thin and glued over other metal, and it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women shared.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet tall, to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most important thing the wheel has given us is much simpler and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each cat has its own role to play, so it's not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, alongside up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behaviour surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and shoot with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a sharp, shouted phrase.
Ocelots like to consume small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this one.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground to find them.
Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population it came from (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants use the sun to make food through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing that got in its way escaped unscathed.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaur species, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex couldn't have done it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called a roach.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets where they lay on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple, which they viewed as the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was less important.
Most of a Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just counters facing the street; the houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled, and in the Norse sagas, it's said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his findings, however, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words: 'Original of the Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, the large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally kept in a scroll.
So the notation was probably made simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was run by the Vichy French, who were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in some way the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and reasonable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its decisions.
It also lacked the authority to nullify laws and tax tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, are the second most successful national football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
"Because of Japan's island groups, it is often said that Japan is geographically an 'archipelago.'"
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The somewhat confusing 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this proportion.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church came to the fore.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether the principle was really being followed.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were eager to avoid such a war in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Periods between successive dynasties were also marked by divided provinces, the best-known of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from an absolutist to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, all occupations were open to men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
It was the same in the military, because instead of the military hierarchy based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that transcended the mundane, and he would often go to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it's there, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things you can see are the clear, beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that remains standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau, also called the "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
'The "upstroke" marking looks like a V and the "downstroke" marking looks like a cap or a square missing its bottom edge.'
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the hook (i.e. the side where you grip the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the strokes are there for musical reasons and should normally be followed.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the frightened queen's eyes.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine state were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear a large part of the expenses and interest related to the bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that includes the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned".
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which causes the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place they occupied in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began to spread around 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.
Its status was in decline during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silks and spices more precious than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses stored seeds, originating from the same ecological region, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called 'untamed' or feral. Some feral children have been sequestered by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Feral children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software to interrogate, provide clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they're deprived of food and love and education, but there are.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe housing, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of children that were not met in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Other distinctive characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in addressing use patterns and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech", showed how people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation in each generation to be dominated by one or the other of the two gene pools.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources were protein from leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest if they're not cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"Given all this, it shouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to modern savannah chimpanzees".
Sleep disruption is the process by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period in order to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking you.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force is, and everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but with the addition of the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the U.S. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process, and culture drove the two countries apart.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It would last forty years, and it would be fought in earnest, by proxy armies, on battlefields stretching from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans, however, became useless almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were put into motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move both goods and people across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to home for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing grounds, usually in the care of goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to well-known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early, to hold the rails in place; however, it was gradually realized that rails would be more effective if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron made wooden wagon wheels wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
"Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as 'Dunlap posters.'"
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap posters still extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But you can still see many dinosaur-like features in birds.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, but the symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best clue to internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nestlings, adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that rearing a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment represents a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers drew heavily on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence for the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by marking either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature exploration tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns in the countryside to their jobs, passing others whose job destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation commute, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to remain within reasonable bounds of constants; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so allowed them to avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical mastery of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since antiquity about some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are fairly easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, water, earth, air, and fire.
He was more reminiscent of the four states of matter, (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and, of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after its invention.
Unfortunately, as newer means of writing appeared, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to touch a sharpener.
You can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill, smashing the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no momentum.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker at higher elevations.
There may be more maria nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what causes people to want to do what they do and what in their environment can cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behaviour can occur when managers begin to manage former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they have to change everything the team did and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership needs to create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology represent physical evidence underlying a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As such, it allows the research area to be narrowed and defined more precisely.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The advent of new technologies is allowing us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but several software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging can also improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since college students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'forces students to be more aware of the world around them.' The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the regular school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs "can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka District and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large portions further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a population comparison that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam, which had great success in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a ring, but don't make it look expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to a man, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's still not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and sailors, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, visits outside the city require an information effort to understand the state of the fighting that is still being waged in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
Boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) can be used to get around Goma. The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu came to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, far-off places".
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by the desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab than African flavour.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are entrance and daily conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into either a number of South African parks or all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island and is the place that many tourists look to as the focal point.
The display of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glowing bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, across the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed on reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonists made their own, and so for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the 'Giant Province of the Indies,' came into being in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups".
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has struggled to preserve much of its indigenous identity.
Argentina is renowned as having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo games, see Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set as equivalent to 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although they will probably accept British and American currency; check with the owners ahead of time to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you must exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and during the summer months, temperatures frequently exceed 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
'There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.'
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bear, and almost any other large animal can attack a human.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep the right distance.
In addition, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid strong-smelling foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to Auckland's location between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where swimming is safe, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, Mission Bay and St Heliers market suburbs of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
You can find a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian would work better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have concerns you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is unusual: a short black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are peppery in price, but very good.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed primarily to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to snag a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, consider the location of the cabin, as navigating through ice produces noise that is unbearable for the most sensitive.
Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the good mood and guests to stay in the place.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Those who drive in high latitudes or through mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you can on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or slush or condensation, or icing of vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly that of the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll be able to see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called "a bushwalk", "safari hike", or "walk") consists of hiking, either for several hours or several days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March, coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in others, several minutes are required.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity in some places to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult traffic conditions of the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, often traversing isolated and undeveloped areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves are common.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in previous sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is all the more important that they are strictly adhered to.
However, bizarrely enough, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Often, the popular cakes go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be "dry" or "liquid" depending on the amount of liquid".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without further qualification, however, the term tends to indicate food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant tastes preferred by Javanese being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The steps support the rider's legs by hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety concerns as a rider's legs may become trapped in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle, but one leg is still attached to the ladder, the horse may drag the rider with it when it runs.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow ladder straps to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after climbing location in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
Peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through walls of limitless potential.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
'Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who organise entire holidays around skiing in a particular location.'
The idea of skiing is extremely old - we have cave paintings depicting skiers from before 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski touring.
It is a related activity but does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering tournaments, the latter being played on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking - but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through repeated visa and passport control procedures.
In this sense, the Schengen area is organised as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control.
Similarly, a Schengen visa holder does not need to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that establishes what manufactured items are antiques; some tax agencies consider goods more than 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit might be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and the trade-related culture is also important to many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mostly as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi have modern occupations and tourism is an important source of income for the Sámi region.
'Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.'
If the country you are going to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Extreme weather' is a generic term used for any type of hazardous weather phenomenon which has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and comes in many forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks facing the area, as it could disrupt their travel plans.
It is advisable for anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone to have professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually through hands-on experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role play, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are plentiful, but publications on war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports that do not state the gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as well.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to go through the scans without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents represent the flow back to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a fast current to deep water can form.
Most deaths occur from exhaustion while trying to swim back upstream, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a position where you won't get caught again, and depending on your skills and whether or not someone saw you, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock is more rapid than culture shock (it lasts less than honeymoon euphoria), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulties in readjusting to their native culture.
If you were to return home after living abroad, you would already have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your native habits.
When you first moved abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, realizing that it takes time to adjust to a new country.
The world doesn't always expect that patience and understanding will also be required of travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
There is usually a constant din of tourists and vendors, and the sound and light show is like something from a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the mainland, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region south of the peninsula, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains unite to give rise to this plateau, then split again to form the 220-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In isolated places with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.

The service is often used in maritime transport, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions requiring remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An alternative increasingly used by people planning a gap year is to combine travel with study.
It is a particularly popular activity among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending university without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can even increase your chances of gaining access to higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid when enrolling in these educational programmes.
"Finland is a great place for canoeing. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast".
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This occurs in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is 1 in forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on excursions aboard a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and the city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and antipathies about other things that manifest themselves in a lot of people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fears that are based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is critical in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies own their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your airline to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and up to eleven times more for first class!
In general, there is also no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed, modern commercial center situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, along with glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls, feature traditional 18th-century red-tiled roofs as well as old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Please keep in mind that you are basically visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still alive many men and many women who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or worked to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't vandalize the site by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are made only in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, among other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype that does not correspond to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is 'bien élevé' (well brought up).
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns to friendliness if you show a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used abundantly.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even inside the sentence.

However, people who know some Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays and remain open as museums or educational places.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in remote areas that have favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.

Many of the traditions associated with Christmas have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
There are of course explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, mammals have not been able to make the journey, and the result is that the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in the winter, you'll experience polar night, which means the sun never rises above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you'll be able to enjoy the stars as well.
