In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widespread theory, but it can also provide details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's fur is chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features - spines and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or appearance.
The researchers argue that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the samples show adult bird feathers, not juvenile feathers.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning has killed two police officers, and injured more than 20 others.

The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversal.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for would be caused by a tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Like the tides caused by the moon's pull on the earth, the Milky Way gives the Sagittarius galaxy its momentum.
Scientists can deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around galaxies is located around the galaxy in the form of a ring of light, and is made of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been an old-fashioned experience: voters lock themselves in a booth, place a printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice and place it in an envelope.
After the officials verified the identity of the voters, the voters put the envelope in the ballot box and signed the ballot.

Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following special procedures.

The document, according to the leak, would refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reported were the future of Jerusalem sanctified by both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a military presence for only five years.
Shooters in supplemental pest control trials must be closely supervised by a keeper as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had received thorough training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn into the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The check was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the cancellation of elections that were supposed to be held in 2011.
There have been 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods characterized by the devices overheating, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
"The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
Former Philippine policemen capture Hong Kong tourists by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then substituted an elderly woman who wanted to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births during her spare time.
Her research shows that when given hormones, fetal lungs mature more quickly.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Extreme Queen. Luna was my first manager. Luna died on the night of the second month. Unique as she was. Strong woman.'"
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as scary as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness status was in doubt.
She was unable to take the medication she needed to manage her pain, as it was banned from the Olympic games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets are the source of water delivered to Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He has speculated about running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, to help air traffic controllers locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport will not operate and diesel trains will not stop at Wembley.
Concerns over the lack of transportation increase the likelihood that matches will be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolve in just two generations, a process previously believed to take much longer due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways, including being rolled into small pieces.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires, which can be twisted and woven.
Gold can be made very thin, and it sticks to other metals. It can also be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton whose electron has been stripped away (as a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders into one, then squeeze into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected by an elaborate sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public bathing houses, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive a call and then bounce it back, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing wheels have done for us is give us easier and faster transportation.
This brings us to trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
The medium-sized cats below prey on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niches, special jobs that each cat takes on to keep them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their young.
The females are usually closely knit together, as an extended family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very skillfully), swim, jump great distances, and pull 5 times as hard as a human.
Tigers are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The sound of a tiger's roar is not like that of a full-throated lion, but it is more like a sentence in which the words are spoken in a growling, roaring voice.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. The ocelot will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can.
Scientists theorize that ocelots follow and locate prey by scent, sniffing out prey tracks on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision, and also move very quietly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from its original main population (such as if they move to mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often encounter an environment different from the one they occupied before.
These new environments have different resources and competitors, so the new populations need different features or adaptations in order to become stronger competitors than they needed before.
The native population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they seem to become less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they breathe in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of their day so they feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is packed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape when it passes through.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal all along.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex.
Although much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a rat.
And when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse.
Ancient Roman food could not carry the food that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central temple, which they viewed as the home of that deity.
Citizens would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would seek to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests were allowed access.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower, called a ziggurat, was built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not so important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops used to be just open counters facing the street, stones were used to build houses.
There were few forests in the land of Canaan, and timber was expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his way west discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote them, it is known that in early times large parchment documents (29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) were rolled up for safekeeping.
So, that notation was most likely inserted just as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"The region was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them".
"The Allied invasion of southern France on August 15, 1940, was code-named Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned it over to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or cities, and it is also a measure of the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations.
Minority cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as viable civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to levy taxes. Since there is no national executive or judiciary, Congress relies on state authorities, which are often uncooperative, to enforce all of its actions.
It also has no authority to override interstate tax and tariff regulations.
The Articles required the unanimous vote of all the states before they could be amended, while the states ignored the central government so that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, also known as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern region, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world
"As a result of the clusters of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to in geographical terms as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices and hired Chinese laborers to work in its rice paddies and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of what the original looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS format group) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds that is most often violated and underestimated is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective place for such a main subject is the meeting of the lines that separate the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During a historic period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which had become wealthy and powerful) came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had united European nations despite differences in language and culture.
Its all-encompassing power affects everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to overcome suffering and poverty.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether this teaching had been fulfilled.
As soon as hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, the Germans suspected a similar response to their endless submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many nations were determined to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, in the interval of each dynasty there was a period of instability of fragmented provinces.
During this period, fierce fighting took place among the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political impacts such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute government to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, opening the door to success for the most ambitious.
The same was true for the military because instead of ranking soldiers based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class citizens of other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often visited the cave later known as "Hira'" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate".
His self-imposed seclusion, which has endured through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when one knows it exists.
He said: O my people! verily I fear for you the torment of a Day wherein ye shall not be able to speak.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased Pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'upward arc' sign looks like a V and the 'downward arc' sign looks like staples or a square that has no bottom".
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward friction usually produces a softer sound, while downward friction is stronger and more forceful.
Feel free to write your own sign, but there is a musical reason for the printed bow sign, so usually the sign must be obeyed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mass of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and chanting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, one member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The expenses of the US imperialist war in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance much of the spending and interest on bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, a fundamental advantage for US imperialism.
To understand Deuteronomy, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the commandment.
The era of these events is usually called the High Middle Ages of the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000â€"1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages ran from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological necessity to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws as well as technological manifestations.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology ultimately has inherent "effects" on society, rather than being merely socially conditioned".
For example, one could say that cars should lead to the development of highways.
Nevertheless, the national highway network was not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass automobile ownership also led to high rates of road accidents, which led to the development of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had considerable elements of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, as well as over time the customs and cultures associated with that geography, and these, in tune with the place of society, are better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury lasted from 400 to about 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, particularly as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europeans began to develop their own styles.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, and uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of a number of factors.
Members of subcultures typically mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called "feral". Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of certain animals that care for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so are the little paperclip characters in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too challenging for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children are not supposed to grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for, and educated, but they are.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide for any needs that were not present in the home where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and approach to gratification.
"For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of the video recorder led to the important discovery of the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements, which occurred in milliseconds.
Specifically, it states that we can detect whether someone is lying by correctly observing their microexpressions.
In his paper entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how someone who cannot understand speech because of brain damage is still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even proposed that the ability to interpret human behavior in such a way might be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, whereas selection removes it from the pool of expression variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources of protein are found in leaves and nuts, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors coped with the 'protein problem' in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today".
Sleep disruption is the process of you being deliberately awakened during a normal sleep period, then falling asleep some time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to keep you awake without fully awakening you.
If you reset the clock while sleeping, then the clock can be put on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, forcing people to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the voltage, the more positive life force there is.
The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism used the foundation of Buddhist teachings, but later expanded it with the focus of Mahayana love and with many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is raised through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and an awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. With the end of the war and the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the fall of the states.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
That war would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real time, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian guards after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods over long distances was by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to make sure that your country is able to maintain its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, impede your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, which relied heavily on U-boats, had tried to prevent this stalemate.
Had the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to conquer England as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising goats for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats usually supervise herds that roam to hills or other grazing areas.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, with these the horses could pull the carriage faster and pull more weight than the slightly rougher roads at the same time.
Rail bearings were introduced early on to hold the track in place, but it was slowly realized that they would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused wooden wheels on trains to wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway was born.
The first known transportation was walking. With the advent of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they normally do.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithcus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living green, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce our impact on the future.
It's like a symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world is developing because of science and technology, and overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans is becoming quite a big problem.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was carried several blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
"Overnight some 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides"".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap folios known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
A lot of people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They had legs with scales and claws, laid eggs, and walked on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first-aid instructions specific to the particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with fleas, which are among the most adaptable insects to parasitize humans.
Both Killer Whales and Bed Bugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in their nest or host's home.
Throughout the United States, there are about 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that it is in their best interests, or their child's best interests, to raise the child.
The couple may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It's not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many note that rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been noted for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue its freewheeling cycle period even when external cues are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They had done two experiments, labeling the DNA in phages with radioactive phosphorus and labeling phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ line cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to natural areas to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work and encounter others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on personal cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has released the biosphere from one of its stable states that for the last two million years has supported human evolution.
Everybody participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In the developed world, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why are there such complaints about transportation systems, why do their services always fail? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent ranges; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be more or less mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to venture into space. Their ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings parallel to their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small-sized places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; the Solar System including the Sun (and even other stars) moved around the Earth.
This seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, about 6 miles [9.6 km] wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers to the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and engineering perfection of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their original forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have metal alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so incredibly small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain several trillion atoms.
At the time of its introduction, the pencil was a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to use a link.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means the atoms tend to break with little or no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Satisfaction theory centers on discovering what moves people or what interests them.
These various theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow older.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want things, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known load theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
"In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls)".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a rift between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there's a slight difference.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to various time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The "stealth team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member".
Why would organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the processes of an organization working together to solve problems can give rise to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before organizations can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and the sharing of organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors result in changes in behavior and some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies has allowed us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
It gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines to automate jobs that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.
School trips are an important part of the curriculum, and often a teacher is happy to take his students where the bus cannot.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing virtual field trips is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old version remains online for use as a sticker book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students typically begin to feel the experience of blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers began to try to improve the quality of writing in order to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also "force students to become more literate about the world around them. The need to satisfy an audience inspires students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage students to extend learning beyond the classroom.
"Appropriate use of blogs "can empower learners to be more analytical and critical: by responding actively to Internet material, learners can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and its environs.
All these things and more make Ontario what outsiders think of as essentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are very sparsely populated and some are even almost uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises a lot of people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than in Canada.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent or associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, which flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, it borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring then it will be very helpful (don't make it look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon for this to be followed by grabbing her arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your opinion (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various geegaws, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma must be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest trips to track Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (ojek) to get around Goma.
"Due to its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
The site was one of the main stops on the PBS special, The Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
In stark contrast with other cities in the country, it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, it charges an entrance fee and a daily conservation fee.
It may also be advantageous for one to purchase a Wild Card, which grants admission to a select few parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The rows of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart are enhanced by their reflection in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is crowded on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the land that the British colonists claimed as their own and if you're looking for evidence of colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the few trees still standing in the vast forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are generally full, so it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters long. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is planned to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurúo and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Province of the Indian Giants", was born as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción's founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere throughout the island, in the city of Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be.
Exchanging Falklands currency offshore is almost impossible, so exchange it before you leave the island.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
"There is no "wet" or "dry" season: for the amount of rain that falls is almost always the same throughout the whole year".
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to human contact, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 300 feet [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 80 feet [25 m] from other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep campsites clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S., and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of an important leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position spanning two harbours.
The North Shore (part of the North Harbour district) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family beaches with nice shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's fun and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white is foreign: black coffee is espresso, cappuccinos come with a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and accidents on the reef resulting from these are very rare.
Still, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appeared near the coast and near estuaries from October to April above 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the sea, their main habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations give travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have a deal with a particular hotel, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agent in advance and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, then you should come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there is a section of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with small children.
If you are sailing in the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as ice crossing can be extremely noisy, especially for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check requirements).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to optimize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offerings of food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the mood of the guests, and maintain it on site.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs mental clarity, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or through mountainous regions needs to take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On slippery, snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you can on regular asphalt.
During a snowstorm, you can be caught in a fast-moving avalanche.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari is used to refer to an overland journey to view Africa's amazing wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment already allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes prefer not to be seen and will be better seen with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also referred to as "bushwalking", "climbing safari", or going "walking") involves hiking, either for several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some sporting events being held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the summer Olympics twice, following the first in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies had not been extended to July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not available in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are a variety of ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is considered sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you may want to consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their power, do not usually fall into the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are duty-free and tax-free in a number of locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries sometimes save money on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through remote inland areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns.
The existing speed limits are lower than the previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to adhere to them strictly rather than otherwise.
Although, strangely, cell phone service is stronger here than in other places along this route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Dried fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums available in summer.
Many German pastries also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but rich cake, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid".
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that represents a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, serving a variety of simple spicy dishes.
The sanggurdi was a support for the driver's legs that hung on either side of the saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially raises safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in it.
To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are taken.
First, most drivers wear driving boots with smooth, narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety bars that allow the sanggurdi skin to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Nicknamed the Yosemite of South America, Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochabamba Valley, has sheer cliffs and giant granite walls.
Climbers from all over the world continue to forge new routes between its boundless potential walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
"Skiing has become a major travel activity with many enthusiasts sometimes dubbed "ski bums", people who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing has been around since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski touring.
It is related but usually unrelated to ski touring or alpine style climbing, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much sturdier boots and skis.
Think of ski trails as familiar climbing routes.
When the conditions are right, you can go further than you can on foot - but rarely can you go as fast as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a smooth track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling to some of these countries requires that you apply for a visa and go through passport control more than once.
The Schengen zone, however, works much like a single country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique.
The definition has geographical variations, with age limits being shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
A craft product can be defined as an antique even if it is younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and its trade-related culture is also important for many people and many professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sami have ever farmed reindeer on a large scale, but live from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and use reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
"Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people".
If the country you are going to is the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, Americans in the Middle East are likely to face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views given are usually cursory, general, and oversimplified when compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and its types vary, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, cold snaps, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country in a war zone needs professional training.
"An Internet search for "Environmentally Unfriendly Courses" might turn up the address of a local company".
Lessons will generally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually accompanied by practical experience.
Lessons last for 2-5 days and will involve role play, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with the battlefield are few.
People planning to have sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure that they have the correct documentation for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001, era.
Pre-op transgender people can't go through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
