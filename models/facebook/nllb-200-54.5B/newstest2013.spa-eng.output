A Republican strategy to hinder the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center dismisses the latter as a myth and claims that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.
And along those same lines, a majority of U.S. governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during the year 2011 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID, as well as proof of American citizenship.
These laws also shorten early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day, and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to require it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo identification.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document such as a Social Security card.
In fact, some 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a state-issued photo ID.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identification.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 percent of citizens over 65, and 20 percent of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters most likely to vote for Democratic candidates, cannot use their school-issued photo ID.
Moreover, those same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who tend to vote Republican to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported laws that abolished voter registration on Election Day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a voter registration service.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, it was exactly the same.
They represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fervently opposed passing laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible to limit the damage to some extent.
For example, only 16 of 34 states passed laws requiring photo identification.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening - To Have or Not to Have?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
This is more than enough reason for men, who are already reluctant, to question whether or not they should be screened.
Take the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States have found a high rate of transmission among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
The European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there is a 30-40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
There is a real need to ensure that the patient understands the extent of his cancer risk and is offered all possible options and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that are not life threatening in the long term, in which case active surveillance of the disease should be the preferred option.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer are not treated because the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease, and if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly setting precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend you take the test anyway.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether you should have the test or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle is still the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and got enough exercise, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, the rate would be at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It is extremely damaging to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", stated spokesman André Beaulieu.
The good news is that 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
Fatness and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life is protective against breast cancer", they add.
What to Eat
The agency also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Meat products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer", they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one showed a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increased risk.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing one's concerns and family history with one's doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed that this boson is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it's the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model -- our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not entirely clear that it's the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
And new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are needed to be absolutely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem small.
There is, in this great world, a universal and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule, and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that it too has such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state".
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And then there's the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Lab's The Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", through which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs we might think.
In fact, if you can read this report, it is because of an extraordinarily common boson - the photon, or "particle of light", that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it disrupts the electromagnetic field in its immediate vicinity - somewhat like throwing a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like a frozen pond in which only a thick rock can slide across the surface.
A huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 17 miles [27 km] in circumference!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The electromagnetic field analogy is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a refrigerator door by itself.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), don't.
But what "can" all this research "bring?" asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (SM), and further allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of the SM.
For their part, many fervently hope that they will, for the slightest difference could open the door to "new physics" that will plug certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we haven't found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our daily lives are difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong in saying that it will have none.
To illustrate: In the early 1960's, laser pioneers in laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would lead to.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as noted by physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered more of a "laboratory apparatus".
Can you imagine that?
And furthermore, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light detector in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Although it was not his original intention, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, earning him the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
That doesn't mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care is the best way to die.
At its Dying With Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of end-of-life care.
The debate should resume soon while a draft law is being prepared.
Within this essential domain, however, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried to get a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year reprieve.
"They had given me five years to live, but I've been like this for seven", he says, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this", he continues.
The disease has taken its toll on him - a debilitating weakness that makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom or even to eat by himself.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts help to eat.
Courageous, he even smiles and talks to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating", she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
To return to one's childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression", he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer offer "curative" care.
89-year-old Mrs. A.'s greatest fear is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the illness has made him discover his children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more desires left in this life", she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on to help her breathe.
And he hopes, in the coming days, a last visit of his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, she and a group of volunteers offer body care and help with food.
It's palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one hospice bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we all know we're all going to die eventually.
Here, life goes on under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional comfort or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics no longer have their blood sugar checked.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the deceased's feet.
"We help both patients and their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, the care manager.
At the Victor-Gadbois centre, every day is different.
Next to a 94-year-old man savoring his last family reunion in the backyard, snuggled between his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two children, having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
Some 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care - care designed to relieve suffering at the end of life, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And a number of organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Home Hospice of Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative deficiency in Quebec health care that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by leading figures in palliative care, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health-care system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently", she relates, "I saw a patient spend 14 days in the ER in severe pain without any relief.
I'm afraid patients will want to die just because they don't get proper care".
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already at their lowest ebb when she left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me that it made her sad that I wanted to stop fighting", she says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing more to be done!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that about 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Greater Montreal, 8 percent of patients do not respond to pain medication.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is used to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want relief".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the road network, construction companies, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell us, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system" of which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system breaks down once you've caught the big media", quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former Montreal police chief.
He led the explosion of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The 'Duchesneau report' established a direct link between the industry, clandestine party funding and official corruption.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of his instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, while hoping to "demonstrate the strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the police of "the Marteau squad", who, since 2009, have made the Montreal "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to register a series of accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been charged.
The latter caused a stir when he explained to the committee the mechanics of the 'system' for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the Mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals in power.
He also admitted to organising an illegal fundraiser for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained it well to the committee: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes from construction companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other highway officials have admitted that they received money by inflating bills by 30 to 40 percent in false extras.
Moreover, an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into an enormous crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1,6 million to developers in full real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money.
Of the research that will finally be carried out, she says that she is "pulling at a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning up the wounds, but we need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and we must be very vigilant so that questionable practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that 'officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars', but is particularly concerned about the role of 'elected politicians who are aware of the stratagem'.
Estimating the proportion of dirty money used to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he is ironic: "I have been told that this is only a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
He called for a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing political parties: 'We cannot sink any lower; getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a sounder basis, with more controls and laws.'
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that breakthrough?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I'm advancing day by day by his side.
The technical staff have also given me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything moves so fast in football.
But I don't get worked up.
From my beginnings at the pre-training centre at INF Clairefontaine to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made rapid progress.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing at a very high level.
They know that every practice is crucial.
That's what makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He's backed up by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
- Of course you are.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all the coaches.
Today, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a wealth of experience and has won numerous titles with top clubs.
He's worked with some big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
I had a very comforting conversation with him in January.
I had just come off a series of injuries.
His confidence in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the lead from us.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we've qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against a lot of very good European teams.
We want, for starters, to finish first in our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of eighteen.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Would not winning the League 1 cup, like last season, constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to put all our efforts into winning that championship.
Last season we didn't get very far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimum conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it's gonna be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It's normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, that they still find things to reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
There's no way we can win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last 16, and they too have invested heavily!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points advantage per day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good the previous season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy with us.
PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's just say we have a gold dependency.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of Ligue 1.
And he's proven in every team he's played for that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes the others to raise their game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things in there and I came out stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the selection.
It's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "bleus".
We have learnt the lesson of what happened in the Ukraine and that is why we are behaving in an exemplary manner today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first month in charge of Les Bleus?
It's getting results.
They're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires them to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc has achieved his goal of qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the national team to Brazil.
Did the 1-1 draw on 16 October in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a game like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is in stark contrast to current monetary exchanges, which are based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been logged thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (prices are censored on the page bitcoincharts.com).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it with world changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) became interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and that can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two electronic addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed using a double-key encryption system.
The network can then verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins are recorded in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that ledger.
This involves solving a mathematical challenge to the computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file fragmentation phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular fingerprint (plus leading zeros).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is cut in half regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed with each increase in computing power.
Life on the Net already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposit stolen.
"The flaw used does not affect the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the potential for money laundering as a result of this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November the 'giant rebates' were launched.
"$30,000 changed hands", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on the currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as well as the transaction network.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, making them cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply supply an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement away from hierarchical systems towards more horizontal ones.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but in 2013 there could be a change", he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of this currency being successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
- And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we regard as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are backed by foreign extremists and former warlords who have taken refuge in Pakistan, but often also by peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped, by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, took place in an orderly fashion.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul unharmed, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul as of the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the ignorance of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the present government and the present Taliban share a desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land to resell as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, while profiting from huge American subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them haven't fought.
The people, from what I've heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have experienced the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is greedy for mobile phones.TV and its Turkish brochures presenting a modern world have big fans all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in view of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
Nevertheless, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950's and even earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dams fixed, and no major irrigation systems repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only heightened the feeling that Westerners were there to take over.
With no energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and no means of transportation to export them over the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have all but abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the massive Buddhist site and remain there as the province's largest employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools for girls, schools for boys, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, aimed at obtaining local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase in cultivated areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys often situated at an altitude of over 2,000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
If they are to be freed from the insurgency by foreign groups, which is what the farmers have told me they want, they will need to maintain a small amount of civilian aid which is well controlled and reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to go for broke.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial entanglements.
This new initiative has only widened the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampling on the right".
Supporters say it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short time span that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is causing havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal was voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either vote for my text or I keep full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange atmosphere that 85 members of this largely Islamist Constituent Assembly voted on the text yesterday.
The majority of the Liberals did not attend the meeting.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society followed suit.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitutes, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As was to be expected, the articles voted on were unanimous.
The commentators are amused, moreover, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that 'the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of law'.
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that 'principles' could be replaced by 'norms', which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The Liberals call it hypocrisy and see it as nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be considerably less moderate than the present one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulama but university graduates, some of them trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about Article 220, since the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We are specifically referring to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule above all this".
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism concerning the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in number compared to what they were under the previous regime.
Another point of conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be banned, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concern about the text, which they considered to be a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy remains a criminal offence and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to appear on television last night, demonstrations are expected this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern conveniences and unspoiled nature.
"AIF" identified the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone entering this "baptismal font" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the site of Jesus' miracles - turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and overflowing nets.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Unction and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews, the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will later come true.
Perform a vertical trip
The ruins of Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who are dedicated to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit by cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There are bus services from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly dwelt on the mountain's summit.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of the most interesting are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in caves in the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is worth a visit.
In its exhibition of paintings it has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private Ralli Museum, where sculptures by Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you're in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they play the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health and safety
The three main tourist areas in Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
Interestingly, they bathe in the Red Sea even in the winter months, when the water temperature does not drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C] and the air warms up to 75 degrees [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and bathing is available year-round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 meters below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustains even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing mud and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll along the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "own" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries, to have their photographs taken.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the seat of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for nightly concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not advisable to carry in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1-3$, 8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transportation is disrupted.
But on Sunday morning, a new workweek begins.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, shellfish, fish without scales, and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, falafel - balls of ground chickpeas - fruits, and vegetables.
You don't see stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that "walk about as they please" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance, which comes out to $15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, scammers who trade in "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families back home.
From 1 December a law comes into force, according to which every migrant worker must take an examination to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the language examination, but also the Russian history and the basics of legislation examinations.
Knowledge of the language must also be confirmed for the purpose of obtaining and renewing a work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, necessity and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, managed many times to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service answer, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Migration Service's representation in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before you leave.
Only an organised selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language and do not pass the medical check.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev claims, the future immigrant will be doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping, will slip him a "paid trip" to a creepy, cramped hole, where he and dozens of others like him languish for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, deprived of their passports, not paid the promised salaries", confirms the Head of the Labour Migration Directorate of Tajikistan's Migration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little chief!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia admit that not only do they not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but they also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive a normal primary education.
This is because their families do not even have anything to feed the children, let alone clothe them, buy them shoes and school supplies.
Upon reaching adolescence, these youths venture out to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize you.
"One feels humiliated and inferior".
However, when it comes to the language law, rights advocates make an important point.
The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have this status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or no strangers allowed".
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake inscription can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea", Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Come on, don't be such a cheapskate, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be forged.
Several "fake" certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Migration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
Up to now, the authorities have been able to promise immigrant workers who failed the test the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Ministry of Interior fails to take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low.
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Shots fired during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on gun ownership will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem by applying the "hard hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the net, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism involving registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told Russia's BBC news service.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Interior, during six months of the year 2012 were committed 142 crimes with use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation on civilian firearms will not prevent criminals from turning to the black market.
Now, according to him, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market in arms is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting orders for guns
The first, "army or military vestiges", that is, weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapons" are those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns come out of military stockpiles.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were started deliberately to cover up the fault", comments a former soldier.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers are also doing their bit.
"Private arms factories that are uncompetitive on the international market have now proliferated and secretly distribute weapons to the black market, including in Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons", explains the former soldier.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
Specialists analyzed reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half the weapons on the black market are there "because of officials whose work is linked to weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his surname not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through an ensign, the supplier purchases a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They strike it from the register and run it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two magazines", he says.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers", adds the clerk.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where there would be a man who would take me to a "little corner" where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I learned only there".
This is military commentator Viktor Baranets.
"To get a gun, I need a friend with connections", says the shop assistant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him very much".
In the markets there are vendors, but there you also have to get, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell you that his daughter had lost a tooth".
I can even get a pair of steel gloves through a trusted person.
He also only supplies me because he knows I won't rat him out.
Newbies look for guns in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets tested himself as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, in his words, have not changed.
He was handed a photo album that didn't say "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat for hare: everything there can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, do not just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the weapon shoots well, we start negotiating", the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", they write in the headline of the advertisement "Buy a pistol or a machine gun".
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fake websites and catches those who want to buy firearms with both hands.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to dig coal in Siberia

I've heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People place the orders.
The buyer makes the payment via an automated teller machine.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the weapon is hidden", says the press secretary of the NGO "The right to arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you are left without a weapon and put in jail.

Makarov for a hundred bucks
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.
It's sent from military warehouses by mid-level commanders.
According to the ministry's official statistics, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, amounting to 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and grocery workers strike across the US.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by Walmart and fast food workers, the goal of the protest organizers is the creation of labor unions in these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has been practically unoccupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off their jobs and picketed alongside unions and left-wing activists at the corporation's stores, whose products target people of modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its shops are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That "Black Friday" marchers demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who earns $9.50 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1 percent more than what it spends on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and caused no loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In all, their cash registers handled nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Company representative Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the left-leaning website Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest was just "another public relations stunt" organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and so for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says they sell billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Nobody makes less than them in this town.
How it's possible to survive in New York on that kind of money is beyond me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as their main source of income or planned to stay there long.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a comment in a Wall Street Journal forum suggests that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the fast food sector workers' unions be created.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from denying this right and punishing labor activists with harassment and firing.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main causes is excessive staff turnover.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of servings, and then doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work".
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers so they can receive the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves".
As the New York Times described it, this was the largest demonstration of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But it involved only a few hundred people, and not all of them were even employees of the fast-food chain, which employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, fooling the brain is not so easy"
The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is lately perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, Google demonstrated a moving model at its annual conference, and then in November it emerged that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, a conversation with Izadi Sharamom, head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, revealed that for the company's scientists, the glasses were already a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with a finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
We must liberate the world from the computer to ours, the physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognise not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think it's overrated?
- Of course it cannot be considered a panacea, it is pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since we do not always want others to know our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not in single movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the device's camera but by a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
Right now it's very large, but theoretically it can be scaled down to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be really hard to recognize.
- In other words, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z axis.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really poor, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually just a visible tuning fork sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the curvature of camera placement and see how this would help determine three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not introduced its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that's their strength (private things only you can see), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in mid-air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There's a problem with this idea that critics often point out: no tactile feedback!
My hands can't feel a thing!
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It registers touch perfectly!
For example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what you feel if someone is blowing on your fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried tricking the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he seems like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open, almost endless space.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy, there is still work to be done for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that a lot of things are in a state of full conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are bright figures of the St. Petersburg art and scene, whose achievements reach far beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became the organ builder of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, by his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I'm a fashion designer and I'm all about appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you were meant to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones who exhibited in Gaza and Nevsky, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - For me it was important to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there existed a musical art club, a bohemian club, the house of St. Petersburg bohemians.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "Van Gogh's Ear" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and that was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers went there.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not easy to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
Nowadays it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uneducated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm doing a scheduled exhibit, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be outgoing, but now being outgoing is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque thoughts.
For example, saving the world through a totalitarian, compulsory change of clothes.
Now they follow you because of your clothes, focusing on the outside but not on the inside.
And, maybe that person shouldn't even be shaken, but spit in the face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
We saw you recently in the role of the town organ grinder.
Who better than me to be?
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons another.
Now everyone is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov they come by the thousands!
- They go to see the abandoned, there works the sexual-social sphere.
And a cultural event has 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which is what people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I'm all for this culture.
- Kirill, what does St. Petersburg lack?
- Good experts in culture.
There is such a thing as a cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones it was different, the kings maybe didn't understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to properly evaluate these and pave the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
Same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St Petersburg.
Giving Birth in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or hitting a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in weightless conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are actual planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars", says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in orbit around Venus... in space.
Problems of reproduction in space began to be addressed with flora.
Experiments with plants began half a century ago.
Four generations of orbit-grown peas were indistinguishable from land varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, little fruit flies, the drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to see how the embryo develops in weightless conditions.
The result is a normal chick.
But then the problems start.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, stand on its own feet, and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks flipped randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we managed to get the chicks born, but then we gave up because it was impossible to work there with them", comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this need to be carried out", comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to tackle the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, having lost their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling into space for 50 years now.
The greatest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: whether it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question", comments veteran aerospace engineer Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice went into orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk remains.
We are few, the astronauts are counted who after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Center is a mandatory stage in preparation for the flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile, environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath is only 2 weeks.
"This is too little to forget something", says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of labor stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
"And then what?" Valery Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton and the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unadapted person", predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, this will eventually become a reality, when humans in their spaceships head for a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NKÚ: Inspection of "švarc" system failed to find guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and good legislation, although implementation is lagging.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also lead to similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, not even the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out these controls or demand obligations", says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in the two countries was compared.
What is it, exactly?
This is a parallel control which we started to carry out about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by national legislation and then national practice.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences: generally speaking, the legislation in our country is 'stricter and more comprehensive', but the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute and what do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely this kind of common control that could help us to stop investing efforts in making laws more concrete, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economics of thrift mean getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest price) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact that we are reducing the ceiling on allocations does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized differently?
As far as the offices are concerned, such as the NKÚ, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a board as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices are developing in parallel.
The powers are also to a certain extent similar, but in so far as Germany has a federal structure, the courts of auditors are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, are controlled in Germany by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to say exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure, but, again, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries which we take as a model have to cope with a large number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't do you any good to cooperate with our office, would it?
As far as the legislation in our country is concerned, what has the amendment to the law on public procurement meant for your Office?
Given the relatively short period of validity of this amendment, it has not yet been reflected in the monitoring procedures.
Since we are carrying out ex post controls, a certain delay is to be expected.
For the time being, it can be seen in the process of preparing for future controls: we have started a new tool for the 'detection of non-economic risks', through which we have passed almost 14 000 public tenders, which have been analysed.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it means a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that can arise is that the rules become 'tougher' and impossible to comply with.
Already under the previous legislation, the persons checked were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any breach of the law on public procurement meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think this way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal mistake, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this kind will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We shall see where this road takes us.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, referring to being autonomous only on paper.
Is the "švarc" system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office which has the obligation to carry out such controls and impose obligations.
You can say, "We'll change the law and allow it", but you can't say we'll ignore it.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how it should be done formally.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded because he does not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
Roads are icy, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are passable, some require extreme caution.
Karlovy Vary region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but with patches of ice and snow.
Temperatures will drop to between five and ten degrees below zero and rise slightly during the day.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, the peaks of the Ore Mountains receive almost a foot [30 cm] of snow.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control centre.
The R6 motorway and the first category road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges where the surface may be icy and slippery.
All secondary and tertiary roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, some sections are still covered with ice and snow.
There is a need for increased vigilance on the roads, especially at higher altitudes.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, reports the Road and Motorway Directorate on its website.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice floes, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
The Czech Republic shall ensure that this Decision is implemented within four months following the date of notification of this Decision.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the mountain roads from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of packed snow on the higher areas of roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range from three degrees below zero to one degree above, with light winds.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, although extreme caution and adaptation to the weather will be necessary.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the region's road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen-Tachov highway on the border with Germany there may be patches of ice.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, also warns of sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less busy roads in the Šumava area.
The following areas in Poland:
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially fallen snow.
After the chemical treatment, snow still remained in the Červenohorské harbour and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators cleared the snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the Červenohorské port will encounter half-discarded snow in the direction of Jeseník", an operator from the Šumper road administration confirmed to ČTK today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forest sections, where the tracks are still wet.
The Czech Republic shall ensure that this Decision is implemented within four months following the date of notification of this Decision.
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on several sections early this morning.
In the light of the above, the Commission concludes that the measure does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
Temperatures remain below freezing even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road.
So far there have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions were ideal overnight, with rain and melting snow expected during the day and clear skies and ice at night.
According to the information provided by the Czech authorities, the total amount of compensation granted to DP Ústí by the Ústí Region for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2010 was as follows:
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by tree branches that had arched over the roadway under the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
They say the world is going to end in less than a month. What do you think?
It's just one of many scare stories we like to latch on to.
We in the band The Tap Tap rather like to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only band in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you are organizing a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain that to our readers?
It's a statewide charity event we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Whose idea was this?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original key chains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, canceled".
It's currently very popular on YouTube, will you be able to hear it at the benefit concerts?
Of course I do, and it'll just be the last one, well, as long as everything works out and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously by a special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We put all our efforts into participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the anti-apocalypse concerts be used for?
A equipment for the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we are completing for the sixth year in a row with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The pupils of Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
The pupils do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works at Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to make a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any similar "spectacular action" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards disabled people and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that there is still a long way to go in the East.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to move around the city centre alone in an electric wheelchair.
As common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, it is not there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been set up to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take example from more advanced countries?
There's a lot of ways we're behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and in Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in public and to be able to go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of disabled people to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes that eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, everything will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The group Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a colleague.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughter).
However, the popularity didn't come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It's true that connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group helped us a lot.
We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to European Union aid, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done differently.
Show business is full of things that look alike.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is received with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few things more extraordinary, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because disabled people are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes right for people with disabilities, then it's not just progress for them, but for the whole society.
Did it help that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand a certain amount of discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out they have to go for two days to rehearse, go to the pre-test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
There is only one, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will involve 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free education centre at Jedličkův ústav in Prague, the cost of which amounts to CZK 25 million.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free admission in the advance sale option at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week's meeting of ministers from the European Space Agency countries, Poland was accepted as ESA's 12th member - the second ESA member from the former Eastern bloc after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began intensive cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented his ideas on the pioneering study 'Introduction to Cosmonautics'.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent, and years later Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In the year 1934 Šternfeld obtained in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a rocket-powered train was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and neither are the details of the project known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to start the dresina or to brake it.
The information about this dresina is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfkem and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the material preserved, it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was discontinued.
In the year 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy the society is first referred to with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the sounding rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first flown on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, construction of the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów Desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of real scientific study.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km (23 mi).
Between the years 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km altitude.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space research on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a wider angle.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
This is a situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to this end 'causes a fall' in the competitor's price with the aim of taking over most of the market and thereby increasing his profit margin.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing altogether.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment it creates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All this has led to a complete lack of interest on the part of businessmen in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital at the disposal of their own population without regard to social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes in existing legislation.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of financial obligation in the case of longterm unemployment and, on the other, through the restricted right of employees to employment rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening gaps between rich and poor.
For a number of years now, there have been food distribution points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves by their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is now close to one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed on such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary for survival.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of auxiliary staff in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all the southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation: people, pressured by a precipitous decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live on a miserable wage at the margins of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will reach the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty either passes from one country to another or never arrives at all, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny fraction of a European wage.
This also affects the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Secondly, we must ask ourselves whether private capital is not selfishly influencing the political process and, therefore, the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation which manifests itself in corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation which is almost universally reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, lacking financial resources, entrust the drafting of legislation to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as is proclaimed in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from powerful financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been disintegrating and the administrations were occupied by force".
In exchange for bribes, ill-gotten favors and help in financing stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and people went to the polls with a pre-arranged vote... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be seriously talked about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appiános thought of Pompeia, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today's society is based on reckless preferences for individual gain without regard for common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as it was then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the present situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal type of democracy as a definite pause, waiting for the next blow.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue to seek other ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none". Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in the year 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on Israel's side, argues for the right of self-defence and casts the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and casts Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodic massacres and who is the victim; after all, the citizens of present-day Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the present political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who profits from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is front and center.
In every age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that goes with it could not have been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Of course, of course.
In the 1890s, they bought the first news agency, Reuters, so that their name would no longer be associated with very serious criminal acts, and power and wealth, or both, would have their backs, which for them always meant empowerment.
They have major holdings in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has ever tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the charter of the Rothschild's Bank of America, started printing money during the Civil War and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second was aimed at eliminating colonial supremacy, especially that of Great Britain; and the third was aimed at reducing the earth's population to between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves would be sufficient for their well-being and luxury and would not consume so many resources), besides creating a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and finally adopting absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of triggering crises and then offering a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation, otherwise it is enough to remember that the Fed was created to prevent a repeat of the crisis of 1907.
So after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, and after that led to World War I, they shattered Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, with the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration set the stage for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which he was tied by the international bankers at the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, will become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within its own borders but also internationally.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where injustice begets injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the root of it all was the greed of a few individuals and their lust for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current President of Israel, B. Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
What light is now shed on David Rockefeller's words in 1994: "All we need is the right major crisis and the people will agree to a new world order".
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the name of the beast or the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers on his forehead, add up the numbers of this monster.
It is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six".
If it gets rough, call Hollywood.
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation offered no positive prospects: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since doing so would endanger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within his reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently further intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The movie "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck is based on an episode from this story, which was a minor hit in America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew who examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction blockbuster.
Gender mixed
The plan devised by exfiltration expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem truthful, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
On the one hand, we find well-documented footage from Tehran. In the credits sequence, emblematic photographs from the time of the events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respected director and his way of acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, following "Goodbye Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town.
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "shot" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places.
The director had to accept the fact that a story told doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes he adds something to the reality: here everything is not so elegant (the scene in which the crisis lurks in Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the frantic search for his trail turns into madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that comes from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and they are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But for it to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a 40% quota of women in management positions in large European companies", explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities listed is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies for men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year".
The election will take place at the end of February 2013", Nacher reported.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive shades the size of hens' cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter spread' and the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from shops have been criticised.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU should be at least 14 centimetres long and must not have 'abnormal curves'.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only seeking to harmonize national standards which had not been harmonized to date and which only complicated their marketing.
Rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive leads to food waste.
The winning candidate in the survey could be last year's EU requirement that inflatable balloons placed on the market carry a mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study which showed that balloons are the main cause of children's death by suffocation when it comes to toys.
A similar restriction applies to the use of mothballs by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
The regulation on European civil servants is equally absurd: anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member state.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the very day of our entry into the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for preserved mushrooms, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying landlocked countries and the idea of granting a subsidy for applying for subsidies.
This kind of thinking did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation,' declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that our country produced a lot of cereals and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from landlocked countries.
The subsidy to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: No national treatment and most favoured nation treatment obligations with respect to medical (including psychologists) services.
The guidelines of the Member States are often the subject of criticism, but the EU's regulatory efforts and more effective operation and development throughout the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the Member States have obtained in budget negotiations.
The Czech Republic, like other countries in the Union, is also involved in the struggle for the right to the designation of origin for its traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious in these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with the Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc curd, but they had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, to 'tuzemák'.
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
Alongside the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, Lübeck marzipan and Parma ham, Karlovy Vary crackers, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and even the Žatec variety of hops are already on the EU's official list of protected designations of origin.
As protected EU brands, you can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and the casks from Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you get the idea to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I wouldn't run.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, how taxes and the retirement age are raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm already 40 and running as an independent, the only chance I have of changing things is to run for senator or president.
He's already in the Senate, but soon after he's on his way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I've always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later made it clear that if elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample anyone who wants to start a change.
Add to this the media, which smears you and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I've been accused of bribing journalists and being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He presents himself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
For that the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to handle it?
As a citizen, I was part of a pressure group to have the profession of guide recognised as self-employment, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholing or party dogma, I have the ability to be able to pick something from each party that is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me to be more on the left.
For me it doesn't matter, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get through this.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
You joke when people say you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without parliament's support, he's left with slogans.
And with that he cannot survive in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I don't have any other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to get them on my side to make it happen.
If I were elected president, I would have no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality who points out the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take, for example, the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I've just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to run things myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years I'll quit and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not some savior.
I know I don't do anything with one person, that's why I visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy for the senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered fraud with light heating oil.
I ran on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did voted for establishment representatives.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
The people elected the senate, so it will be difficult to achieve change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have the time to do so, to check the spotless background of every potential party member, nor do I have the money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
You speak of declarations of ownership, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have land worth 25 million, a flat worth ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is worth $60 million and you have no campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my show.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The expenses of the campaign essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
For example, I could not pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for office.
So you'll continue with your business activity in order to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a raise.
As promised, I've partially given up my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I need to make a living too.
How much do you usually earn a month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I'm still making.
If I were president, then I'd quit the business.

Architecture studio MVRDV proves that real adventures are not only in the head - on the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "Besides, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one goes into those old-fashioned libraries for fun, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Rotterdam hardly worth a quick visit, has the dubious honour of having set a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to make a contribution to the general culture by copying the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so policy makers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: build a library!
Winy Maas of the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master of the art of bar graphs and responsible for funny yet cynical buildings, approached the subject with his usual serenity and attended the competition presentation in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in bewilderment and shrugged their shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words:
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain rises in its intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment buildings and townhouses.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the 'Dutch National Wood Award 2012'.
In this way, the small town with no history, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that this is a paradise of books under a cheese grater.
True, there is an elevator that takes us right into the heart of this mountain range, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, preferring instead to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy on the eye, the annealed brick floor and elegant lampposts unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Looking up, you can see park benches, dogs, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Usually the bookshelves are arranged along the facade, and in the middle there is a large dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we've turned the classic spatial configuration upside down and taken the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves, which serve as wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a Frisian farm, we stumbled upon the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a plastic mesh a few millimetres thick has been used as a support for the roots of crops.
It's a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts for two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour into a dark, homogeneous and durable material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 1,600 feet [500 m] around the mountain, we are rewarded with not only a fantastic view of the city but also delicious Dutch croquettes and ficus plants in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology", says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is provided by geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
Huge wooden trellises across the glass facade provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to the blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, also visited the library and described the 'Boekenberg' as the 'late soul' of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration which took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the town were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
The aim is to fill the gaps in a library which does not yet have a complete archive, but which currently holds 70,000 items.
The concept has taken hold.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative all the inhabitants now have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved a great deal of success in that key discipline which in specialist jargon is known as 'identity creation'.
The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
Regardless of how young and uneducated he may be.
At last a starting point to shape their identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer state status at the United Nations.
However, Berlin ultimately abstained.
What's wrong with that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the country's special relationship with Israel, Germany has to be careful.
But at the same time I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear stand on important international issues?
Yes, that's right, I did.
This is because it is now reorienting its foreign policy away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and towards a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already started down the road to a 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What exactly does a 'normal' foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy which, when national interests are at stake, is prepared to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful not to alienate Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not attach too much importance to it because it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining on important decisions like the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been as drastic a break as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps this has earned Germany a certain amount of respect.
After all, all this has only demonstrated that it is a country which is taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, was clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding for the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the real difference of opinion is not as great as is claimed.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand with the position of its main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
They therefore have no possibility of being part of a higher authority, but must push things forward from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European attitude.
Of course this is not at all easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a touchy subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player and does it really want to play a leading role?
Or do you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet got used to it, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany is positioned as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and that is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You have to show an open attitude to different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The United States' influence on European politics is diminishing, but the EU is not filling the gap. Who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more prominent role.
Even if you don't like it, if you find it distasteful or if it makes you an even more unpopular people, that's life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This name hides a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be proved right.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes across my desk.
Copycats simply add a couple of letters so they can register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada is registered as Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeit goods.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he fights against the trademark office officially granting Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "caught" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
"It's bad for business, we have to fight it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is ruined, the monopoly position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous".
The financial losses and the procedural costs for the sectors affected are in the millions, especially in the case of iconic luxury products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the world's third-largest and fastest-growing luxury-goods market, worth $15 billion a year.
However, obtaining the cancellation of dubious registrations in the trademark register is complicated and expensive.
Proceedings can last up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name being sued had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plagiarist's brand in China", says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, which has recently been taken over by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why to this day the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that strongly resembled BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to change it.
Clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile facing the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the emergency work situation returned to normal".
In this way, the number of unprocessed complaint processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads for the tenth consecutive year the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, they would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Put another way, this means that on average each entry costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family firm Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has succeeded in securing the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
"We have brought this situation on ourselves because surnames are not protected in Germany", says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office also dismissed the appeal by the municipalities.
In the next two instances Freudenberg has been vindicated, but the other side is still fighting.
You have to be very careful.
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident of a favourable outcome and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to search through records up to a hundred years old to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the other party a 'six-figure sum in euros' with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care", says Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether he is aware of the fact that in the United Kingdom, for example, there is a ban on the sale of counterfeit goods.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg in Germany for shoes and leather goods.
The group has long since abandoned this business, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international legislation on trademark rights, but it is necessary to "register everything that can be protected in China", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the matter may be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of its particular battle, then it would have to pay the other party licensing fees in its own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of business.
World Aids day: dance, sing and help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming far more than 5,300 miles of distance.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and loafers search the parquet floor for the beat, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor, and soprano) begin to rise slowly, swirling, hampering, and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to go almost berserk as he tries to bring order with his forceful and gentle gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Also present are the fifty singers, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and moreover in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, about 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in Esitjeni village.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution covers school fees, uniforms and guarantees you one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "eulogy speaker" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak fluently this Bantu language, but they can sing.
For the past ten years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign tongue that occasionally transports them back to their homeland in southern Africa.
Some 5,300 miles [8,733 km] in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 have lost their parents to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
Circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of HIV infection, is frowned upon.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's inhabitants are infected with HIV, and death in the early 30's has become common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and education.
Without a high school diploma, opportunities in a poor country are more than limited.
In the beginning it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal every day.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which since then has professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Diseases
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Lice and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
For heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus, candidiasis, and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections occur among young people aged 15 to 25.
In our country, human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were registered in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
They often cause no pain or other symptoms and so go undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through infections from dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical checkups, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any long-term consequences avoided.
Through contributions, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they manage to raise a lot of money.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In Zodwa Dlamini's own village a self-confident woman with leadership skills administers the money sent from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have as many as 14 orphans in their care, provide them with a roof over their heads, and see to it that the children attend school every day on time and in their school uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the US health organisation PSI, has had many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since the disease is rampant throughout the country but is rarely discussed openly.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and lavish lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficial way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who roam the country and take it with them wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms are available on every street corner, but they are rarely used.
It's another culture, they only accept skin-to-skin contact here".
To promote cultural exchange, every two or three years the Imbongi Choir travels through southern Africa singing songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope, and confidence in the black race - songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a Negro language; such recognition not only brings a fine atmosphere and much joy but has also managed to bring a tear or two to the eyes of the occasional rabid border guard.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town barely appears on maps, in the Ezulweni River valley it is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines", say the locals.
And after traveling the 5,300 miles [8,733 km] straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street filled with singers setting the pace, you realize that you can see their light shining from there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers water ice on Mercury
The MESSENGER probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also water ice there, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It appears to be at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably came from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger principal investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could shed light on how water and other components of life came to be in other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and tiny robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send back images - tiny windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named W5 by scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This twinkling image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of material that the star spits out in its dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming region.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
With a telescope, however, colors can be seen more clearly.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a land continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color display.
This budding star was captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lanes divide the hot core of this star-forming region into three lobes.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph evidence of a cosmic carom: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are hurtling toward each other, eventually colliding irreparably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who dislike technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula, located 1,400 light-years away, is composed of dust particles that are between 10 and 100 times smaller than the dust particles you might find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists name the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming region is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continually being born, 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this very bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers speculate that it formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Window on the Universe - The Most Powerful Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and the images they provide have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest.
Its mirror, in the picture, was five meters in diameter.
The Large Binocular Telescope is erected in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows observation of the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 34 feet (10.4 m) in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about 35 feet [11 m].
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, its capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, researchers can scan the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its acronym in English) can help anyone who owns a computer, contributing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It's not expected to be able to take images until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world's largest.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea a new telescope of enormous proportions with a mirror 100 feet [30 m] in diameter is planned.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending back images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
This picture shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers assume that ice also exists at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no conclusive proof, since the Messenger spacecraft orbits much closer to the planet's north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.
Drink butter every day and live 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people live to be Bible years old.
There is even a museum there devoted to longevity.

In the south of Azerbaijan, many people live to be Bible years old.
There is even a museum there devoted to longevity.
A footprint search in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus hurtles along the winding road past forested hills, fast-flowing rivers, and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think you're in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, just a few miles from the Iranian border.
Here live the "talyshi", a people about whom not much is known, apart from the fact that they are fluent in Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts architecture that is perhaps too massive, designed in the Soviet era, and doesn't quite seem to fit into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists rarely come here, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too rough.
It takes eight hours to travel the 200 miles [323 km] between the two towns because the road is one-way.
The country's staggering oil wealth from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will hold the Festival of the oldest people in the world", Fatulayeva notes.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here documented are the lives of eight dozen local talishis who are over 100 years old, Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived for 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to prove it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov then been wrong about his age by a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, has also heard of this Central Asian's advanced age.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza valley in Pakistan there are also very old people", says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific proof of age; especially when there is also no civil registration.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
Today, there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in the diet.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, he's relatively young for what passes for style in these parts.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly churns a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, serving it in typical domed cups.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under her headscarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son proudly shows us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and kept its color.
"I have also never used a shampoo", Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live on.
She has always eaten only what she grew on her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been to a supermarket in my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst period was after World War II.
However, everything returned to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyev, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange coming from an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult of the father figure of the nation, who rules his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over to his son Ilham.
At least elderly people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: "in our culture the elderly are highly respected".
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if that wasn't reason enough to keep you alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous divide in which the country is mired.
The future constitution, based on sharia law, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, hitherto hopelessly mired in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologetically, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, which were forced through by a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, is meant by "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague wording and the legal leeway that goes with it to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a newly added article suggests: in all matters concerning sharia it is obligatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
This need not be so, but it may mean that the clergy would control legislation, which - in effect - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts were used to harshly repress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is such a vague formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of films and literature.
To put it bluntly, this is nothing but censorship.
It is true that no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
Another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what constitutes an offence and how it is to be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording prohibiting "offence to persons"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a man of letters enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to defeat the Act before it can take effect.
"The revolution is back and we will end up winning", says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the presidential lists.
Nobel Peace laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him", says oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been expiated yet", opposition politician Khaled Ali was quoted as saying in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it shouting: "the people demand the application of divine law".
They demanded that Morsi "cleanse the country", while proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all started, would have led to a situation similar to a civil war.
Obviously, Morsi's supporters didn't want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists' draft has a guaranteed majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution", he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three branches of the state made this lawyer resign.
The measures adopted are blatant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it", laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, even by the international community, which is watching the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could blow up in your face.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "you are conceiving a monster that you cannot control".
Norwegian rakfisk - the world's smelliest fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has something to do with its craving for a particularly foul-smelling fish?
Have a series of over-cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular, and that ever-present smell is in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this most, shall we say, captivating delicacy.
"You eat it raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit in one gulp", says Havard Halvarsen, the city's fireman who is also what is known as the "Rakfisk General", who is in charge of organising the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking significant amounts of the beverage in one gulp.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk", says Havard.
The booze can kill the smell.
I'm trying some bits.
If you can keep it out of your nose, that's fine; it's not much different from a piece of sushi that's traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product from a very different time, when poverty was rife in Norway and, before refrigeration, fish was kept in water and salt in airtight barrels during the autumn.
Later, in midwinter, when it is well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses dulled by alcohol, eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their homeland in search of work, mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants from Sweden, the old rival and until recently not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered important, an essential, if rather smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich costs you a whopping €10 ($14) each.
Norway is not often on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, as she passes trays of rakfisk. With her long blond hair and striking blue eyes, she is the picture of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people".
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to show off, we don't like ostentation".
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; all but a small percentage of the money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone else was spending money they didn't have during the years leading up to the worldwide financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we're happy", says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk", he adds with a hearty laugh.
I'm in the snow queuing for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel where I am staying is one of many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television station has connected live with a presenter wearing a bow tie and surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our scores, Havard".
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps overcome by aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a rough start
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that, at best, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday cutting off several of the main roads leading into the city and causing massive traffic chaos.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
You're faced with a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
'I will propose a new security strategy which will enable us to achieve that objective.'
Before rubbing elbows with the US president, Mr Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A densely populated and rapidly growing state surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement over the cracked and potholed roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques bearing his name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sports stadium and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will achieve real and lasting change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly as it relates to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs".
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejected the opposition's characterisation of the new President as lacking substance.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and above all a good listener".
However, across the state that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden beneath elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year the military was called in to help fight the drug gangs operating in the barrios and violence against women is particularly severe.
In just the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left in a deserted lot next to a garbage dump.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendía struggles to hold back tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been cleaned", recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already set in".
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross on which is written a single word: Justice.
Yet that's exactly what the family says he's been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up".
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect", he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his term.
"I hope he is the same type of president he was when he was governor", says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the Ciudad Neza victims fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to address allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison.
The trial centers on Manning's time at the Quantico military prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case thrown out on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was harsh.
The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors sought to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to speak out about the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military custody.
During the prosecution's questioning of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits from unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about his treatment.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing held in response to the defense's request that the case be dismissed on the grounds that his incarceration had been harsh and sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visiting Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When asked about the forms by Fein on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment he received from the guards as "excellent" and the treatment he received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about her treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the visiting officers had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after I mentioned the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean I didn't mention any problems", Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported her treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board tasked with reviewing suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention at that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the 'injury prevention' regime under which he was placed.
The military said he had been placed under this restrictive regime, which is one step below suicide watch, to ensure his protection and that of others.
"I wanted the general staff to know that I was fine and (wanted) to stop being on injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located on the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness because of the heat.
She said the fact that she wasn't allowed to know what was happening to her or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to just Camp Arafjon, to that cage", Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was gonna die in that cage".
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move around all the time, since sleeping or even lying down during the day was forbidden.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointed at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned over at night, they would wake him up to turn over again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday's deposition that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning roll call.
Manning had testified that he was never given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the recount.
During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the warden that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before in an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his underwear or his flip-flops to injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account his experiences in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted at the court martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to get Manning to plead guilty to lesser charges and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all detainees in maximum security custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of public property or records.
If found guilty on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those hard times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely walked down the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area when I was totally confused.
Signs pointed the way to two lines - one for "Mexicans" and the other for "Foreigners".
I stood there for a few seconds not sure which way to go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
I later settled on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and stood in the alien queue.
I thought about that moment this week when the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, were immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now as likely for a Mexican to stay in Mexico as to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, reminders are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Moctezuma's sons are on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about a grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that somewhere along our family tree, there was a person, maybe a father or a mother or a grandparent, who was shut out of the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, low education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
At times, our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the Mexican elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us like we're a lower category that's not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their eyes, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in America but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there's this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter resent it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they don't belong to either.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not rooted to any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexican.
Now, to further complicate things, from what I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as impromptu "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
It's not gonna happen.
There's too much rancor.
And, with income inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's a great country.
I'm afraid you're on your own with this one, folks.
It's only fair.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still bitter about how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm. What is it?
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that all hope is in vain.
Amid the usual futile arguments about who started first, heaps of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even as Israelis and Palestinians seem to be locked in their age-old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces. Whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to believe that their deadly stalemate could be broken.
A War That Is Neither Lost Nor Won
At first sight, optimism seems very difficult to justify at present.
Even if the November 21 ceasefire holds, this week's clashes have emboldened hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and crowded corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to finish off Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced Hamas's cause.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the militia party Hezbollah dominates, through Syria, where increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on Israel's southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even by Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, hardliners in Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep easier... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more assertive than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main chunk of a territory aspiring to become a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even more hardline group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why coddle those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good whack if they raise their heads.
Hardliners may prevail, though the Arab Spring could alter their calculus.
Even if the Islamists who seize power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much love for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the region will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis, too, should think long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography is making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to push back Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution is still the one advocated by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the surrender of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the people outside who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Outside Arabs should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain virtual statehood status at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Australia's plain packaging law comes into force
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and diseased body parts appear on dark green packs, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australia's world-first plain packaging and tobacco law comes into force and replaces brand logos and colours with a drab olive green wrapper, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies sick from smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory from Saturday, are the brand names, all printed in a small font.
This is the strictest regime for tobacco packaging in the world.
Australia's federal government claims that the goal is to discourage youths from smoking by removing the traits that make the habit glamorous.
He relies on studies that show that if a person did not start smoking before age 26, there is a 99 percent chance that he will never start.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls associated the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not greatly affect the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage a black market in tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeiters will bring in more tobacco from China and Indonesia to sell on Australian streets.
Other people say their business has benefited after the law was passed.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unpleasant images on packs had skyrocketed almost from zero two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the High Court of Australia.
Ms Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6000 units to wholesalers and was expecting more stocks.
"It's good business for us".
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most retailers to keep cigarettes out of sight, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews from "ordinary citizens" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises whether this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on the implications of the new regulations than on marketing.
The industry has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a ruling by mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to make it compulsory to include pictures on cigarette packs.
They are now compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"Photographs have no effect on me.
I just ignore them".
"You take the cigar and keep the pack", says Victor El Hage as he buys a pack with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter".
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging makes it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unwrap a package; now it takes me four", says Yu.
"The government should have totally banned smoking and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we close the shop", he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to be a little bored.
During this year's Thanksgiving holiday, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means of entertainment, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But a growing number of academics and child-development experts are extolling the virtues of boredom.
According to them, it is good for us and for our children to be bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us today are glued to one screen or another, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we embrace boredom?
Yeah, I got it.
And you didn't.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more leisure time, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But this is not so, according to Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, published in 2011 by Yale University Press.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century A.D.
We also need to rethink how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways", says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and presenting the idea to a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able, to participate in a fulfilling activity".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that a person doesn't do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "an altered attention process, associated with low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as environmental or worldly, whereas people who are depressed see the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what's really happening to us is we're having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to an unrelated television program in the next room at full volume, others listened with the volume turned down so that it was barely audible, while the third group heard no audio at all.
The group that listened to the program with the volume turned down showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had trouble concentrating, but they weren't sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you're trying to focus on a difficult or interesting task, distraction can lead to boredom", said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts on a production line, distracting music can help you not to get bored".
"In fact, we now know that moving or doodling, actions often misinterpreted as signs of boredom, can actually help combat it by making that person more physically alert".
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: a delayed plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure it, some researchers in the 1980's developed a "boredom-tendency scale".
The scale includes questions such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything".
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that by using such scales, researchers have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, and they need more external stimulation and more variety.
But by and large, teenagers are a fairly easily bored group.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search engine.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But what she did know, she said, was that "adolescence is a time of peak boredom", largely because both children and teenagers are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my original question: Is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it's not, because taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, like gambling or falling into substance abuse as a way to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short run, but not in the long run.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he hasn't learned to entertain himself or to pace himself", says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dose oneself applies to other situations", he says.
Not only does your child learn to entertain himself but he learns to exercise better self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
At the same time, we should not be overly critical of him.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with me.
"In our view, we need to be more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate to anything worthwhile", he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy some downtime.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated", he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus when the noise stops".
Colorado: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car, and shortly thereafter Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each carrying a $100 fine) informing him of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals", says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of small drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession convictions are being overturned both here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.
Police departments have stopped charging those over 21 with small-scale possession, which will be legalized once the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative districts have pledged to move forward with marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This is all changing so fast that I don't know what's next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington State are also mulling over the matter.
And they are still seeking advice on setting up a licensing system for production, manufacture, distribution and sale - all before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent to serve as a model", he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year in which to swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as how to balance the state's requirement for "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds or child care centers.
"Nowhere will it be harder to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metro area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city attorney would stop prosecuting people over the age of 21 for minor marijuana possession offenses and that police would stop filing charges for those offenses "with immediate effect".
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce city regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to put pressure on users to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute misconduct that was criminal at the time it occurred", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on marijuana legalization.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I do not consider that I am wasting my time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and legal system was never going to be easy.
The conflicting reactions emerging across the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding this state's great environmental experiment.
"It's a cultural barrier with the district attorneys", says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents those charged with marijuana possession and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court that they still can't really accept that it's legal", he said.
By becoming the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana the same as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the nation's test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are counting on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also eagerly awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hopeful that the Justice Department will relent.
Although there have been some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
"Although drug enforcement officers probably won't break down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to sell recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law", said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new pot shops, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level", explained Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for".
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: 'I was hounded out of Oxford for being a Tory'
You don't attack academics for their views just now
I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s as a history major, I had packed my bags, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had dropped out because I could not tolerate some fellow students having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink from uncorked cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was hounded for one reason only, which in the cradle of the so-called Enlightenment was intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what this is all about.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
Such is the institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students in Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's JCR say they are "often seriously ostracized, personally attacked and treated as undesirables" because of their political views.
They want to create a position on their college's equal opportunities committee to ensure that they can express their opinions freely.
Their plight was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics which portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a silver-handled cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as "patsies" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Party Association at Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other".
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says the atmosphere is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19, president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was more lonely than one.
I entered college in September 1986 as a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when the new students meet each other and the professors, I got a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mocking of conservative academics but willingly participated in it.
The politics of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first one I attended had 18th-century French texts to be translated into English, and I wasn't prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I didn't get one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like sponge cake, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they simply stupid?" he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes burned from the tears I tried to hold back.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people", snarled Pitt.
I went back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner at the university; then I felt a gentle pat on the back.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's the way it goes.
They pick on anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many Tory newcomers appear to be Labour".
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to disguise it.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated".
Other students adopted that little ditty.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They're beating each other up, aren't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal law of the 60s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I join the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead seemed like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History appointed to my college.
They hated him because he was not only a Conservative, but he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speech writers.
I was barely there.
He loathed the place for what he considered provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here", he said.
I began commuting daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan relatives and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was a student there in the 1940's, all political viewpoints were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", she said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming needles.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude".
Her aching eyes began to cloud over.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just for fun.
It would break my heart if you left him".
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was wearing thin.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his faith.
The following week, during a seminar at which another history professor had implied, quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men".
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At the time, my father was writing two columns a week for Murdoch's Press.
My door was locked.
I was cowering inside, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
After they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You may call me a weak crybaby.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to that level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Conservative prime ministers but which to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", an apotheosic retrospective that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", she says in her unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most granite of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino displays these personal mementos as trophies of his rise from humble dressmaker in the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad", explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, close to forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decor, the food, the music, you could see and feel her spirit.
"He made each guest feel important and wanted", recalls the supermodel, who began working with him during Paris' Haute Couture Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art", he concludes.
Parade of alumni
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long catwalk that offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to gaze at a dreamy "audience" sporting Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins, names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, in 2006
A lot of these clients say their first Valentine's Day is like their first love, "unforgettable".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" waistcoat and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he enhances our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of having the age and the occasion to wear one of your evening gowns...
The time finally came in the late '90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit with a ruffled skirt, a draped corsage and a neckline.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her couturier's party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to produce this ivory-colored, pearl-encrusted silk suit with 12 different types of lace and a 15-foot-long [4.5 m] train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, a leading authority on haute couture, the dress represents a milestone of late 20th-century haute couture, "the return of the society clientele".
Obsessed for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is its best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance", admits D'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him".
If a princess says so...
The toughest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their job is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it must descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After tearing out large lumps of sulfur, weighing up to 150 pounds [70 kg], he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets over steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, but it takes the exhausted porters more than 40 minutes to ascend at a snail's pace, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall over the precipice.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who tumbled from the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once at the top, they push their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, wearily carrying their heavy baskets, walk two miles [3 km] to the scales that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 6,000 feet [1,850 m].
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (US$0.70) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widely used in everyday life to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry about 150 pounds [70 kg], we make about 46,000 rupees [$3, U.S.] per trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
He spends three hours on each and ends up crushed, but he is allowed to collect 138,000 rupees (US$11.50) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, it is triple what I would earn in the field.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", explains the porter, who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cutting was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, shortness of breath, constant cough and irritation of the eyes from toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been risking his skin for three years in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, a persistent cough, and irritation of the eyes from the volcano's toxic gases.
It's the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur keeps pouring down at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminated by a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he has bought with his own money.
Some 400 porters carry baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the crater floor
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs, nor does it supply any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and by weight.
In fact, they do not even see a fraction of the 30,000 rupees (US$2.50) per camera surcharge, along with the 15,000 rupees (US$1.50) entrance fee, that park rangers charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for beasts and not for people", protests Madrusin, a stocky 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, she assures that she will endure working "all that she can" because she needs the money to educate her three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious illness - apart, of course, from their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain, and sore shoulders, which have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, aged 30, also works hauling sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: that done by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem far-fetched that these verses are part of an advertisement for peppermint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to poke fun at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes the ad will draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty".
This is purely an internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the world's worst at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, like releasing pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
A lot of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is write a rap?
1.2 children
The one not taking it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decline in Singapore's birth rate.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, websites abound with thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unintended Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as 'shoe boxes', that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square metres and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single-person lifestyle and discourage developers from building large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" are selling much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans who work in the downtown financial district, it seems they won't have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time", says another young man in his 20's.
Men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the final say.
Private off-line is private online.
It's called privacy.
According to the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española (Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy), it is the quality of being private or "the sphere of private life that has the right to be protected from any intrusion".
What's private to a 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers of posting things online that you would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the password and username", when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't post my deepest secrets", says ten-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everybody", she says.
On FB I upload pretty pictures or games.
I also entertain my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't of me, or someone making a fool of themselves", he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene pictures, pictures of naked people, pictures of crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother's in on it, she's got a key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them", he adds.
"Social networking is fun, and I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly", she says.
He does not hesitate to say that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who recommended a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example", he says.
According to the boy, no one has ever made a pass at him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm pressured or demanded, I just take it out of my account", he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who I was", she says.
The victim, according to Jose, never closed the account.
"He just put privacy in it".
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, he would, if he didn't like me or wanted to.
"Even though I know that's cyberbullying", she says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game have changed", he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and is the author of Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning", he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion about what should or should not be disseminated, published or said at an age that maturity does not allow for that".
"Also, be selective if your main concern is to be popular, to have thousands of friends regardless of the consequences".
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is through thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to is not helpful", she adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of yourself published like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag photos from parties, do you ask other people's permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, one acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be in social networks", he says.
Monitoring and surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary-school teacher, and educational consultant, says that it is essential for parents to read social networking policies carefully.
By understanding each of these points, parents have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or posted", he says.
According to Guardia, a key lesson is to remind children "not to talk to strangers".
Unasur summit ends without Lima declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe tried on several occasions to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially indicated that they would deliver it after the closing, but later affirmed that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of Unasur attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents attending, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the III Summit South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced was not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were secured for all journalists but limited information gathering as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that today we are taking to this international court", said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, the peaceful solution of controversies, treaties and international courts", added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The President read out the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are extending the agreements on residence".
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America, and joint and efficient response to natural disaster risks".
MEPs in the committee are calling on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the EU's financial interests are taken into account.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
'We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations', from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good neighbourly relations, was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully deal with the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible that I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers previously met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
In this respect, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship, which is being encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers through any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never commit themselves to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States", he said in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his process would not be respected".
MEPs in the committee also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in animal feed.
Correa claimed that there is a risk of Assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I have not spoken with him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", said the Ecuadorian president.
There is, however, the danger that being confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors will damage your physical and mental health.
"That complicates anyone's health", he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances", he said.
MEPs also want to see a ban on the use of genetically modified organisms.
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy in London or via Skype tomorrow, this problem will be over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and clarified that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this regard he congratulated that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected "he will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the correct direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coups clothed in legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy".
The House adopted a nonbinding resolution approving the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.
That ruling is not being followed at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They have to be processed in a comprehensive way to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accepting a ruling no matter how hard it is".
In reference to the eventuality that he will run as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, so we have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it'll be my last term as president, and then we're out of the public eye.
If we lose anyway.
"It's a decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled for a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to spend the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are caused by late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he tested positive for AIDS.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me", he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "a little softer", with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take matters into his own hands and began to learn about his illness - so much so that he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying good-bye to him "because he had a cut".
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
Yet, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune systems, and become victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years when they report 500 CD4.
In simple terms, this means that whoever is diagnosed HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "as long as he stays in control he can live without problems until he is 75 years old", explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why do people keep dying?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had a shortage of drugs. The problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they don't know their infection status, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He gave a resounding figure: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection. What needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, to offer screening tests massively, to all the people who require it".
Specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested at a private laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, I might as well blow my brains out three times a week", they say not in my case.
The change was for the better. I'm eating right, exercising, taking my meds.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I am also responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate experience with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid today, on World AIDS Day.
Get tested, if you were at risk, the sooner you know if you are HIV positive, the better and if you already have the diagnosis, learn that you can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter.
Large are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatío journalist who has taken up the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is on prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom", he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sarcasm and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, said the communicator.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be redirected; that condoms not only be behind the counters but that the 100 condoms be found in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It's not to encourage promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying the chelas and the motel, as the governor Emilio González replied, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"This is not sexuality, the best thing is to bring condoms to those who already practice sexual activity", he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a court of appeals of the United States a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore seem that the procedures for guaranteeing the survival of firms permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the backing given to the ruling handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenceless against the possibility of seizure of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the principal procedure is the Mexican bankruptcy.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created to that end, with the American Law Institute serving as arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of the tender, the debts of Vitro's subsidiaries to their parent company would not have achieved the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The fact is ignored by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the sidelines of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will lodge a reconsideration appeal with the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full court, that is, the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court overlooked a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Mercantile Competitions, noting that this was vented with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
A double whammy: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
Balance sheet total
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviators Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to give reports to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channelled into the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're closing in on Dragon Mart.
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution centre for products from the country of the wall to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a suitable housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental coso that razed part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the secrets against the industry.
ACTA is dead
Ignored by the government a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, housing developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos worth of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Born Competitive
Composed of the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the social name Competival has just been born, whose objective will be the services market of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was linked to the sport of tabloncillo for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as extensive as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federation president during the 90s", Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-power or proxy of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, either as a proxy, co-proxy or manager.
Those were many rewarding years, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I ended up with one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator", said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had coached here and was at the University of Alabama, said to me, "I've got a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already a federation leader.
At that time I preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the Pre-Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and should have been bronze had it not been for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
It's among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze at the worlds.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and young James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympics in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the mess of the Panamerican de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who's been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Little Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculín did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a tough one.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to have implemented, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruits of compulsory certifications and courses for managers, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
So, what are you doing now?
Most of what I do is listen to music, watch old music videos on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by "Dallas" producer Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, reprising the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he met.
He was creative, generous, funny, witty, caring and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"She was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a liver transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted sitcom "I Dream of Jeannie", which ran on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious J.R. that propelled Hagman to stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional tagline "Who shot J.R.?", intended to build anticipation around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars at stake in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to out her as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had motive to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable crook with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, on Friday remembered Hagman as someone "huge, on and off screen".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us who was lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in the works, the network reported.
There was no immediate word from Warner or TNT on how the show will handle Hagman's loss.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 she titled her memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything out there that I thought was going to hurt anybody or affect them in any way", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an advocate for organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I counsel them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and after", he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it's gonna be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you're gonna be okay".
She was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible lure: The end of the Mayan Calendar's "long countdown" on December 21, which many people have seized upon as proof that the world is coming to an end.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited her in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "debt Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-times theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what's been happening in the world today as if we're 30 days in and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, adjunct professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course called "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible", said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' because we always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours", Restall said of his course for high-achieving students, which filled with 35 students.
We got emails for weeks and weeks before the semester started, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, say the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Religion and Sociology major from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic mindset, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that", he said.
I enjoy it.
But not a single student interviewed - much less a teacher - said that he believed in the December 21 expiration date.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and we kind of debunked it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about this", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond to a question about whether he knew of any "end of the world" courses there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many doomsdays have been talked about over the years, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to attend "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh with me", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
