Not only does this prove the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but have other features of feathers - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flight, but for temperature control or appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but that this specimen shows adult feathers and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that although the tail was that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The annoyances within the community resulted in current efforts to establish a policy regarding sexual content on the site that hosts millions of pieces of openly licensed media content.
The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on the earth, resulting in tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the constellation Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is in a ring around itself, and it's made up of a large number of smaller particles.

"The thermal behavior of these is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth that often maintain a temperature that is fairly constant, which is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally requires little technology: Voters go to a polling station and put a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope stating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the voter's identity, then the voter slips the envelope into the ballot box and puts his signature under the ballot.
The process is relatively narrowly defined in France's electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and volunteers count the votes at night under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may be tainted because her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have ruled that the publication of photographs is potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos and other material of suspects.'
The Crown Office is in overall charge of prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been laid.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only prepared for a five-year presence.
Shooters in the additional vermin control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters have undergone extensive safety and training before the first shooting operation.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has obtained a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the former National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to ensure new elections in the country.
The commission was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread anti-government protests that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the lack of elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious".
"Very regrettable", was the ministry's response to Apple's delay in releasing the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former policeman from the Philippines took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been taken to safety and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins went into medicine, following in his father's footsteps.
Trained as an obstetrician, he joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While employed at the hospital, Liggins spent his spare time researching prematurity.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme.' My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of the participants in this poll agreed with this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other extreme, 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the meds he needed to ease his pain because they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the formation of planets, especially the formation of the earth, since it has been a long time since comets have impacted the earth.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and chatter".
There is speculation that he intends to run for the presidency in 2016.
The NextGen system, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technologies, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately and to provide clearer information to pilots.
No additional transport is used and no overground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the car parks and the P&R are not accessible on site.
A possible lack of transport made it more likely that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science examined the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take much longer because of the longer crossing time between a native Darwin's finch, the Middle Ground Finch, and an immigrant Cactus Ground Finch, the Española Ground Finch.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided.
After being made very thin, it could be glued to another metal, even being made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Next, the color of the charcoal changes according to the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical gives the pH value.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewers have been found in houses in Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia, and in Roman times they were often part of a public bathhouse where both men and women gathered in mixed groups.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately transmitted back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result.
There are medium-sized cats among those eating medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as feral cats kept as pets) that hunt larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that look surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats) and that are very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and has five times the pull of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A tiger doesn't roar with all its might like a lion. It's more like it growls a whole sentence.
The ocelot's preferred prey is small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when they can. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively animals much smaller than itself.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment there are different resources and different enemies, so the new population has to behave differently or adapt to cope with the competition.
Because they still require the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance, you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Through photosynthesis, plants extract nutrients from the sun and also provide shade.
Our homes, our clothes, are made from plants, and we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain back then, and it had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the roof of the mouth, which meant that nothing or no one could escape it.
It's not certain, but it's possible that its tongue was forked, and it ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even its own kind.
In bodies of water, too, nothing was safe from its attacks; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, whereas rich men liked to have a banquet together where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians had a central temple for each of their deities, and the temple was considered to be the personal house of that deity.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a rear chamber accessible only to priests.
Sometimes pyramidlike towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the hot climate of the Middle East.
Much of the daily life of a Hebrew family took place outside the home.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west, and named it after himself.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the personalities, royalty, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different.
After watching the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There is some writing on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, the large parchment (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was likely rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, and these were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and were therefore siding with the enemy rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations, and a civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, and thus are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of a Congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary and relied on uncooperative state authorities to carry out all decisions.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
First, all states had to agree unanimously to the Articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government seriously enough, and their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as a "peninsula".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC took over the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683 the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Made up of three major structures, Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored.
For example, the most common still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analogue film era.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the aspect ratio that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would then be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, widely abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that keeps an image dynamic yet organized.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, thus dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
At this time in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common man, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church has funds for this purpose.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being followed.
Great Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, since it was no longer possible to supply vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, but the blockade did violate generally accepted international law, which had been laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters, blockading whole sections of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations adopted an attitude of pacifism and isolationism.
After World War I, nations wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had with him only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the different dynasties when the provinces were divided, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time there were fierce wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is remembered as one of the bloodiest, with thousands dying in the struggle for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the view that the country belongs to its people rather than to a single leader.
Post-revolutionary positions were available to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and qualified candidates to succeed.
It's the same in the army, where the ranks are no longer based on a person's class, but on a person's caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired revolution by the oppressed working class in other countries.
Muhammad was intensely occupied with otherworldly matters, and he often went for contemplation to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Nuer Mountains.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on a mountaintop on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it wasn't easy to find, and once inside, it's completely isolated.
All you can see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of countless large pyramid structures honoring a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Pyramids of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow mark looks like a V and the down-bow mark looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow away; bottom means you should start at the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and tighten the bow.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, whereas a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your own personal signs, but remember that the printed signs are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
A group of market women were behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and threatening mobs that threatened the King and Queen.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered at Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were required to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance much of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested to a large extent on the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, which in turn were followed by the Late Middle Ages, usually ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide assortment of ideas in practice: from technology supply or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: that the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the advent of the automobile automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership is also causing more road accidents and this is leading to the development of new healthcare techniques to repair the human body.
Romanticism incorporated a great deal of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures emerged from this geography, creating a harmonious society that was superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is today.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with silks and spices worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic reached its zenith in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the West lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinctive style began to develop in Western Europe, and one of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming which produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, using stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture may be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often indicate which group they belong to by a particular symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave, and the jargon they speak.
One of the most frequently used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization has been the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adversity or deliberate abuse while growing up, were not socialized by adults.
Some wolf pups have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents would not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unruly children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behaviour similar to that of the animal that cared for the child (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning is supposed to make education simpler and more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without assistance.
There are various reasons why children end up in foster care, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they're not cared for, where they're not cared for and where they can't thrive, and yet this is happening.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Foster care is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
In foster care, all the needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new aspects of motivation such as 'personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to remarkable findings in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that no one can detect a lie just by looking at microexpressions.
In his essay The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates it from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation there is variation between the two groups through separation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to man's may find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the vegetable sources found on the savannah.
Furthermore, failure to heed it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually even death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it is also very rich in proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the same way savannah chimpanzees solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption involves waking up for a reason during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easily done by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up all at once.
If you turn your clock off in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which may cause you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm that a person has is in contrast with the amount of stress that he carries in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and each person is capable of achieving contentment and total peace.
Anyone can clear his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and an emulation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (energy of enlightenment) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity-focused yoga, which uses the visualization of various deities to clear energy channels, activate chakras, and bring the consciousness into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. was established, and when the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies faced each other head on, marking the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, and proxy battles took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were overtaken overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the task of the navy has been to ensure that a country's ability to transport people and goods is maintained while the enemy's ability to transport people and goods is hindered.
The U.S. was trying to get men and material across the Atlantic from the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of World War II is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always have easy access to hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area, guarded by goatherds, just as the more familiar sheep herder is often a child or young person.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted only of a rail of planks, the horses had to run ever faster and haul greater loads than on the somewhat rough roads of the day.
Crossmembers were used fairly early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if an iron point was present at the top.
This soon became common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were laid.
The first form of transport that we know of is walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus emerged.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
Fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago show bipedal specializations, and Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate some future suffering.
In many cases, it is like a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate it.
Clearly, scientific and technological developments in human society have profoundly altered the earth, and overpopulation and the extravagant life-style of humans have added to the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away, signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 were made during the night, and these are now better known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap Pamphlets are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one species of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their feet, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary numbers is the basis for nearly all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits.
Internal poisoning may not be readily apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists formally call this group of insects "bugs".
This term comes from a centuries-old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasitize humans.
Both red imported fire ants and bed bugs are nest-bound, having adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disorder in both young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works through the scientific method is the most important goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet, it involves more than just experiments; an experiment is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, question them, and make observations, as a guide to scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West's understanding of Greek philosophy and science declined as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the key clues that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out, one in which the DNA in the phage was marked with radioactive phosphorus and the other in which the phage protein was marked with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary; other mutations can cause cells to die or become cancerous.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching, visiting parks, and studying the ecosystem can all be done there.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people from small villages drive to work and pass people whose workplace is in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transportation shuttle is in some way connected to and supportive of a car-based transportation system.
Science indicates that because of this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place these past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed lands, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are relatively rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they go wrong every day?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is fairly predictable, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematical terms.
Relationships have been established between the three key characteristics to better reflect traffic flows: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so allowed them to escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a greater number of small places.
At present, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many believed just the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, and so did the sun (and other stars).
This makes a lot of sense, because you don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second-longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, being six miles wide in places.
At least 20% of all the water that flows from the rivers to the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and engineering excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
Italian is the language of official communication and law in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most commonly spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used in religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they are all found in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table has a lot of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was such a trusted friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have developed, the pen has been downgraded and is used much less.
Today, messages are typed on a computer screen without ever needing a sharpener.
You may wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atom bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they fall apart at the slightest thing.
The surface of the Moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the Moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marls on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could come to the surface more easily there.
Content theories aim to find out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's motivational hygiene theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of behaviour that emerge when managers start supervising their former colleagues.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary action, conduct appraisal interviews, delegate, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, this individual transforms into an unrecognizable individual, and he or she feels compelled to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to own everything.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a rift between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are slight differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They're often more autonomous than traditional team members, and that's because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports, and the invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity emerge when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization.
The result of this is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management needs to foster a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, allowing the research area to be narrowed and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumours can affect behaviour and lead to changes in mental ability.
As new technologies become available, we learn more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that allow us to understand more about the processes of our mind.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it's also an essential part of computer science, used in research on machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior falls under AI research.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for personal computers and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Advances in technology now make virtual field trips possible, allowing students to view artifacts in a museum, peer inside an aquarium, or view beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions of which are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better, often starting with poor grammar and spelling, but quickly improving as they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them", and the need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used appropriately, blogs can 'help learners develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively engaging in discussion on the Internet, learners can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time develop their own views on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south, you'll find Niagara Falls, and to the north, you'll find beautiful, unspoiled Muskoka and more.
These are the kinds of things that make Ontario uniquely Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are quite sparsely populated and some of these areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of fauna, it is almost a continent apart.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them the Islamic faith, which then spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether they are or not.
It also helps to wear rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviour they find intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad, and the Spanish traders who established their trading post here called it Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina, you can find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, hookahs and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava that destroyed Goma and buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, check the status of the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
Boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) is a convenient way to get around Goma, costing about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
"Timbuktu" is relatively inaccessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport make it so.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of desert storms.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS exhibit Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from other cities in the country because it has a more Arab than African feel.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered on the east by Mozambique, on the north by Zimbabwe, and on the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wildlife species are kept.
As a major tourist attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entrance fees.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers either access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The multitude of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a shimmering bar graph made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's population live in close quarters on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into the Indian and Bengali interior.
The Sundarbans is now officially a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part within India's borders is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are more than just mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last great stretches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peatland and swampland.
The Sundarbans became a game reserve in 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 white-tailed deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river), mostly between 6.30 and 7.30 am, mainly in the east and Jakar/Bumthang directions.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese coaster buses are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis allow quick and comfortable travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianan city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3.50 meters.
Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guarani were the most prominent indigenous group, living in what is now eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the Indies, came into being in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
This was followed by three centuries of colonization by the Spanish.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley, opposite FIC West.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
On the outlying islands, you may not be able to pay by credit card, but you may be able to pay in British or American currency.
Exchange your money again before leaving the islands, as Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside the islands.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it is summer there, it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures well above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below freezing, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
Rainfall levels remain roughly constant throughout the year, with no discernible wet and dry periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still wild animals, and should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears, and just about any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port in what became known as the infamous Standoff.
With the exception of one British battleship, all the ships were sunk and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the paramount leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, died at a nonviolent meeting in the city that got out of hand.
There are many beaches, mainly because of Auckland's two harbours.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
Nearly all of these are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees for shade.
At Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, are the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family-friendly beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good selection of shops along the coast.
'Number One' is the main local beer which is not a complex beer but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more suitable for travel.
The local drinking water is usually safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a foreign concept to Australians: black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are year-round trips to the reef and injuries resulting from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek professional advice and follow all safety signs and warnings.
Box jellyfish are found from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and the majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport and sometimes even flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, be early to secure a campsite near the music.
And remember: Even if the music on the main stages has ended, other parts of the festival grounds may be alive with music until the wee hours.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
If you are crossing the Baltic in winter, be careful where your cabin is, because the journey through the ice makes a tremendous noise if you are too close.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically strive to make the most of the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages; however, when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
If you are going high up in the mountains or driving over mountain passes, be aware that snow or ice may be present and that temperatures can drop to very low levels.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, making it different from asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become trapped.
Visibility may also be obstructed by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many lands and do not impede traffic.
Africa's main tourist attraction is safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to traveling overland to view Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment provides a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars. Otherwise, you're unlikely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk or walking safari) involves walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer in effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these items even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer, if available.
Ensure that the fabric does not become too hot (this may cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are a number of ways to purify water, some of which are effective at mitigating specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute; in other areas water must be boiled for several minutes.
Not all filters are equally effective, and when in doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal diseases that are not found in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill humans, are not considered vermin.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save considerable amounts of money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often driving through abandoned backcountry, and that makes this trail one big challenge.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you. You'll encounter many steep inclines, narrow streets, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent areas - usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and it is even more important to abide by them than usual.
Surprisingly, you get a lot more coverage here than in other corners of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are delicious, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, as are those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
You'll see a lot of fruit cakes, and throughout the year, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste great with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but mighty pastries, try some called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the interior of northern India and also in Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most common Javanese seasonings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can also cause safety problems by trapping a rider's feet.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets that allow a stirrup to release from the saddle if the saddle is pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and boulders.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Downhill winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums', planning entire holidays around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it's similar to alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is often done on steep terrain, and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You can think of the ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover longer distances than you can on foot, but it is rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, travellers between different countries usually have to apply for visas several times and undergo passport checks.
However, the Schengen area operates almost as one country in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques, and some tax offices define goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition may vary from one location to another; for example, in North America the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify craft products as antiques even though they are newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Among the Sámi, reindeer herding is an important way of life, and the culture surrounding trade is also very important to many in other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
In Sápmi, the Sámi region, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'Gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma, but it is also often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma.
If a travel advisory applies to the country you are planning to visit, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own authority, you can also consult the advice of other authorities.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a cursory, general and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of weather events, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Signs and effects of severe weather include high winds, hail, heavy precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
Examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather in their area as it may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
An Internet search for "hostile environments training" is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues outlined here in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on wilderness survival, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers who have planned sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to issue passports that do not mention gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much variation in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Moreover, searches at security checkpoints have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not come through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or similar object and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is located in some deeper parts, where a fast flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is a snap.
Try to focus on a place where you won't get caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than culture shock (you have less of a 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who readily adapt to new cultures may have difficulty readjusting to their own.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your own customs.
In the past, when you traveled abroad, you found that people were patient and understanding because they understood that travelers needed to adapt to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected of travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the neighborhood.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here, and the story of light and sound is like a book.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where you'll find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the south side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau and then emerge again to form the 220-mile-long (360 km) Mount Ellsworth range, which is traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used by the maritime industry, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where external data and communication are required.
Your local telephone provider can tell you more about how to connect to this service.
It's becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
In particular, school leavers take advantage of this to take a gap year before university without detriment to their education.
Often, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
Normally, tuition fees are required for enrollment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing.The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
Hunting is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak, you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people go boating in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is similar to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, and is also quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in 40).
Most Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Thus, you can spend several full days in the historic site and stay overnight on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat trip.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see from the map, Berlin is not near the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of; it is no different from many fears that other people have.
Knowing how airplanes work can help dispel fear of the unknown or of being unable to control the aircraft.
Courier companies are generously compensated for delivering items quickly, and when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for necessary repairs, time is often of the essence.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft on certain routes, but other routes and smaller companies faced difficulties.
If they're shipping things by air, some routes can take days to unload and clear customs.
Only as checked baggage could it be processed more quickly, and according to airline rules, there must be an accompanying passenger, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or, better yet, have your employer pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times for economy class for business, and about 11 times for first class.
There is usually no point in looking for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know only too well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova. The main language spoken here is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by UN members.
Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul and a good traffic junction.
Once an ancient city, İzmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center on a bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centers covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than a traditional Turkish one.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a remarkable octagonal church.
A number of tombs near the church contain fascinating marble sculptures of doves.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely take a look around this village.
To the north is the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous by foreigners after Lord Byron praised its magnificent monuments.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally known Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember, you're actually just visiting a mass grave, but also a place that has an almost immeasurable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
Many of the men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity.
Do not damage the site by marking or graffitiing the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Nevertheless, most signs are in Catalan, as that is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is widely spoken on public transportation and other services.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
Parisians are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
While this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well brought up).
The Parisians' tough exterior quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their ways.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There is a great diversity of plant communities because of the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying altitudes.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie, besides many more common species.
When visiting a monastery, women are required to wear a knee-length skirt and have their shoulders covered.
Usually, if you arrive at a monastery unprepared, you will be given a veil as a woman, but if you bring your own, with nice garish colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile kindly at you.
On the other hand, men must wear pants that are at least knee-length.
You can also borrow them from the supply at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing them.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available for seasoning, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, like Sie which means you, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they're in the middle of a sentence.
In this way you distinguish a first name between a number of verbs and objects.
Even so, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether to use a verb or an adjective as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation is generally not a problem.
You should pay most attention to the c and the g. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will therefore teach you a lot about Persian grammar and help you to understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you do not need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Back then, light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flower, and that's where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were meant only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural setting, so resist the urge to remove even "just one" species.
If you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion refused access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics,' just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sunshine (less often when the sky is clear).
Some buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take actually goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, unbelievers in Christian lands and non-Christians around the world have adopted many of the traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Obviously, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian springtime and fertility rite.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with congregations celebrating the resurrection of Christ at the stroke of midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands did so by swimming, flying or drifting.
The long distance from the mainland made it impossible for mammals to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work attire and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Consistency in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praising individual performance.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without thinking.
