An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, was initially seen as having disciplinary potential, but formal studies showed that it had little benefit beyond what was sought to prevent death.
Unlike PALM, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared it with three different treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by continuing to have meaningful innovation within our organization, rather than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could potentially provide the truth as to how the abuse of proportion so bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could possibly go unnoticed for so long and justify any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share a common goal - to make the sport of gymnastics and other sports as accessible as possible, so that athletes can achieve their ambitions in a safe, positive, and controlled environment.
In the 1960's, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his adviser and then in the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

Not only does it confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage is chestnut-brown above and pale carotenoid below.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers, called rachis, did not have a well-developed shaft, but featherlike structures - barbs and barbules - researchers speculate that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development of these other markings.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shown shows adult feathers and not those of a chick.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shown shows adult plumage and not that of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than two dozen people.
The governor's office said that the nineteen injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun behaves like the simple principles of other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system is known to be driven by their light, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic distortions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to replicate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for could be caused by gravitational waves between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth that causes tides, so the Milky Way uses a force in the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects regular matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter is surrounded by a galaxy in the shape of a corona, and it is made up of many small particles.
Television reports showed white smoke billowing from the plant.
Local authorities warned residents near the plants to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners and not to drink tap water.

Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new category is "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll suspects that some patients were infected by the hospital bug, and at least two of these were hospital health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still relatively low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected at any given time in South Africa.

The government has also promised millions of vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Plans for vaccines to be delivered to the most historically affected areas this year have been delayed by lack of funds and low priority for other diseases.

Their thermal properties are unlike those of any other caves in the world at the same temperature, but they are similar to those of deep craters", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an unmodern experience: voters set aside a booth, place a printed sheet of paper showing their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the vote roll.
French electoral law scrutinizes procedures closely.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting period and that no extra envelopes are left for properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every step of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, and certain procedures are followed.

He was immediately transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in Edinburgh Sherrif Court and was charged with the murder of her child.
He is in custody while awaiting a contempt hearing, but any evidence of the witness may be tainted because his good image has already been publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but the justice system in Scotland is different and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee writes, "journalists are walking a tightrope and it gets even tighter when they publish photographs and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, indicated to the press that no further comment would be made until the arraignment.
The document, says the leaker, deals with the contours of the borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel asked for a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to leave such a presence in just five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest-control trial were closely supervised by rangers, as well as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
With the cooperation of the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
As Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, points out, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the CEP's early resignation as part of a set of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving gadgets.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman kidnapped tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Shortly thereafter, photographers replaced the elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that when the hormone was administered, it accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhuan reported that government investigators obtained two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by his fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna died overnight at two months.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as green as I am...maybe more so...I love her and miss her...may she be in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 national election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard admitted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled shared this view, preferring Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the conclusion of the election, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He had stopped taking the drugs needed to control his pain because they were no longer allowed at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Multiple people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
There is a possibility that comets were responsible for bringing water to earth along with the organic matter that formed proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, who took office earlier this year signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He focused on rumors that were "political rhetoric and nonsense".
It was predicted that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to target aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been installed and trains also do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available as of yet.
Fears of transportation shortages raise the possibility that the game will be forced to take place in a private arena away from the team's fans.
The study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to be much longer, because of interbreeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
They deck it with pure gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers.
It could be drawn into thin wires, which could be twisted and woven. It could be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "ornamented manuscripts".
You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Swirl the two dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing them to smell and form a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a modern sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere bends some light and distorts our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and raccoons.
Finally, there are many small cats (including live domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, mice, ticks, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job held by each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large herds called prides.
Prides consist of one or three bands of adult males, along with about thirty females and cubs.
Often the women were closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters, nieces, and nephews.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not unlike big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit poorly), swim, leap great distances and pull five times the weight of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not the full roar of a lion, but it is the speech of angry and shouted words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds when they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and locate prey by scent, sniffing out where they come from on the ground.
With their excellent night vision and lightning-fast movements, ocelots catch their prey by blending into their surroundings and catching it as quickly as possible.
When a small group of organisms (a subpopulation) moves away from the main population from which they came (as for example when they move to a mountain or stream, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they were born.
This new environment with different resources and different competitors, therefore, will require the new population to have different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor than what they would need in a sauna.
The original population remained essentially unchanged, needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, their appearance becomes progressively different from that of other populations.
Eventually, after a thousand or even a million years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they remove the carbon-dioxide that humans pollute (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat most of our food from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The Mosasaurus was the tallest predator of its time, so it was fearless, unlike other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw is studded with 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, making it impenetrable.
Its diet included whales, large fish, and other dinosaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex will have no tail.
While many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or exotic foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, owls, and a type of mouse called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals while sitting on couches, the rich preferred to feast together, resting on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman diets did not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians made each of their lords a chief temple recognized as the house of the lord.
The people brought offerings to the god and the priests tried to meet the gods' requirements by ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Often special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the turbulent climate of the Middle East, the home was not of great importance.
Much of Hebrew family life revolved around the outdoors.
The women cook in the fields; the shops are in the streets; the houses are built of stone.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse stories, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on continuing his journey west, Greenland was discovered and named Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was put away for safekeeping.
Thus, it is more likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, the French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had cooperated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and confronted Germany.
A civilization is the unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning town or city-state, and that also describes the size of a society.
City-states were the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture communicates by transmitting knowledge over several generations, ensuring inheritance and equitable distribution.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first created a weak central government - of which only Congress was a part - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to tax, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it relies on state authorities, often unwilling to help, to enforce all its acts.
He has neither the authority nor the power to override the tax and tariff laws of the trust states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed and the states never took the central government seriously because most of their representatives were not present.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete internationally and in the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that make up Japan, it is often called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the southwest coast of Taiwan, started a revolution in aboriginal grain production and employed Chinese laborers to work their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a good idea of how the sauna was actually built.
A common example of harsh/hard light is the midday sun on a clear day.
For example, the world's most common still-image photography format is 35 millimeters, which has been the dominant film size since the era of analog film.
They are still produced, but their aspect ratio is significantly better than that of digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35-millimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters long.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) have the same or close to the same aspect ratio.
The most oppressive and often ridiculed laws of categorization are the simple guide to creating enthusiasm while maintaining a measure of composure in an image.
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired great wealth and power, faced a test.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite their different languages and customs.
Power that is pervasive because it affects everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that such wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist for that reason.
Rome had held the central authority of the church for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether this teaching had been achieved.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated what is generally accepted as international law enshrined in a number of international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering whole areas of the seas, and this posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany hoped for the same response in their unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of the average citizen and of the country was one of peacefulness and seclusion.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of war during World War I, the nations were anxious to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York city.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing the different periods of its history; each Chinese period or dynasty was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty was a period of instability in the divided provinces, the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period that occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times fierce warfare raged between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China in which thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the high palace in Xi'an.
Many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And again after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military because instead of rank being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this world. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides the clearest picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located high on a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to see even if one knows it is there. Once inside the cave, it is completely alone.
Nothing could be seen except the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, few things on earth could be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., was one of several large pyramid structures built in dedication to a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has many pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in dedication to Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in dedication to Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" mark looks like a cluster or a square with one end missing.
A high one means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and a low one means that you should start at the tip called the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The up-bow usually produces a low-pitched sound, while the down-bow is louder and more aggressive.
You are welcome to follow your own markings, but remember that the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of prostitutes.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced open the window of the King and Queen's carriage.
On one occasion, a member of the mob decapitated a royal guard who was executed at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the cost of U.S. imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States for financing much of the cost and interest of bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people may constitute fundamental victories for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the formation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of training ideas, from technology-push or technological necessity to a full understanding that human destiny is driven by underlying logic combined with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are natural, and not socially conditioned.
For example, one might argue that a motor vehicle would necessarily result in smoother roads.
However, a nationwide transportation system is not economically feasible for only a few vehicles, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Increased car ownership leads to more road accidents, which has led to the invention of new techniques for repairing injured human bodies.
Romanticism had much to do with cultural determinism, derived from such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped each individual, and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, adapted to the social environment, fared better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It rose to prominence as an epicenter of luxury beginning about 400 A.D. and lasting until about 1100 A.D.
Its decline during the twelfth century was largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices worth far more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished during the 10th and 11th centuries and again in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, western styles may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seed found in an ecological region and combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allows them to create an identity.
Subcultures may vary in age, ethnicity, class, location, and/ or gender of members.
The qualities that define subcultures as distinctive may be due to linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership by a distinctive and identifiable use of style such as fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of association is to take some tragic cases of children who were neglected, involved in an accident, or deliberately abused, with no adult contact as they grew up.
Some feral children have been abandoned by their human caretakers (usually their parents); in other cases they have been abandoned because of severe physical or mental damage.
Baby snakes may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or escaped.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in forests alone.
If the child is raised entirely by animals, this feral child will show characteristics (in physical limitations) that are almost identical to those of the particular animal that cares for it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding is more than that.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique but an aid that supports individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold as well as the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are included in the software and are intended to question, facilitate and explain procedures that may be too challenging for a student to manage alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many reasons ranging from abandonment, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is uncaring, uncaring, and unteachable, but some are.
We could see that the Foster Care System was a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, solid education, and reliable health care.
The orphanage was supposed to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home where they were taken.
The Internet combines two elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of terms when it comes to use and methods of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "being social" have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal contact" and "ongoing relationships" were also recognized as new aspects of enthusiasm by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined viewer reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has resulted in important discoveries in the interpretation of small expressions, facial movements that last only a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell when a person is lying by accurately pronouncing small statements.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, reveals that even people who cannot understand speech because of their brain damage, can guess with accurate sincerity.
He further suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation breeds new genetic variation, and selection draws it from a pool of different points.
The segregation and reintegration of different shuffles is repeated between the two pools in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a monkey with a digestive system similar to man's to satisfy its amino-acid needs from vegetable sources.
Moreover, if this is not done, there are dangerous consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most readily available plant foods are proteins from the leaves and seeds of plants, but they are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they also provide a high amount of protein that contains all the amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah monkeys do today.
Sleep onset is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you find yourself resetting your bedtime clock, it may be placed on the other side of the room to force you out of bed to turn it off.
Other diet-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, known to stimulate urination) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace of mind a person achieves is inversely related to the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
Less stress, more positive energy in life today. Every person has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to reaching this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but enriched by the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (power of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra and meditation.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By looking at various deities the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which resulted in the cooperation of the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, processes and culture resulted in misunderstanding between the countries.
Two years after the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have to be fought virtually by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had collapsed, and the only hope left was to withdraw and reorganize on the basis of Romania.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army troops of the Soviet Union invaded and created the battlefields of Belarus and Ukrain after they occupied the eastern region of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo ships are by far the most efficient means of moving large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move men and supplies, while at the same time, hampering an opponent's ability to move theirs.
One of the more spectacular recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used U-boats, sought to block this passage.
if the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have conquered Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats, usually herded and lying in wait on hillsides or other pastures, are often cared for by goatherds who are usually children or young adults, much like the better-known shepherd.
Chariots have been made in England since the 16th Century.
Even though wagonways were made of the same wood planks, they enabled the horses they pulled to go faster and carry heavier loads over the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that it was better to have an iron pole on top.
This was a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wagons' wooden wheels.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some areas.
However, if we want more than a temporary solution, then we need to get to the root of the problem, and we need to get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of human scientific and technological advances, and the problems of overpopulation and human extravagance have only increased.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft of the treaty was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made in full gauge, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
On July 8, John Nixon first read the document publicly on the grounds of Independence Hall.
One had been sent to George Washington on July 6, where it was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
And 25 Dunlap broadsides, known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people did not view them as dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make them like a dinosaur.
They have scaly feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as nausea, are so common that immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for the particular poison.
The word bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an old acquaintance with Bed-Bugs, which are insects adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
Throughout the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop Multiple Sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose or plan to adopt a child of their own.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different mate can become the child's parent.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works by applying the scientific method, which, in effect, guides all scientific research.
Not alone, experimentation, a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, also guides scientific inquiry by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
The accepted views on all scientific matters, including psychology, are those of Aristotle.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself out of touch with Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are sometimes crucially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-regulating mechanisms that keep time running smoothly in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that marked either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in the germ-line cell can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of indoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people in small towns drive to their place of work and are passed by others whose destination is work rather than their place of origin.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected to, and supportive of, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now shows that this huge carbon economy is removing the biosphere from one of the stable conditions that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developing countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems receive such complaints, why do they fail daily, are transportation engineers incompetent, or is something more important going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with one another.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers drive at reasonable speeds; thus, traffic flows have the right consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, a relationship is shown between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships are helpful in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, using flight not only as a means of evading predators but also as a means of obtaining food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward along the body.
This gives them a greater variety of places to hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that do not fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the Solar System revolved around the sun.
A few people believe that he is correct but many people also believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems logical, since the motion of the Earth cannot be felt, right?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest and largest river, carrying eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The widest river in the world is the Amazon, sometimes six times a mile wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is both the world's smallest independent state and its most sparsely populated one.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian was also the everyday language of the common people while Latin was the common language of religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, since they are all found in nature in native form and can be mined quite simply with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four basic elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he considers that they can change and become new substances to form what we see.
Actually, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals, such as silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny molecules called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this talk.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Sadly, as newer writing techniques came on the scene, the pencil was consigned to a lesser state and use.
With computer screens that people can now touch, there is no need to use erasers.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus upward also releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have mobile nuclei meaning that they tend to separate with little or no pushing.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick at the near side and 60 miles [100 km] thick at the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the mountains.
There may be more maria nearby because the crust is thinner, allowing the lava to rise more easily.
Content theories focus on finding out what people like or what makes them tick.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/ or desires that they acquire as they grow to adulthood.
These theories look at what some people have that causes them to do what they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Simply put, two attitudes emerge when managers begin to take the lead over their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making decisions that upset people, taking disciplinary action, measuring employee performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable for mistakes.
In the other view, one is transformed into an anonymous individual who feels he has to change everything the team does and make it his own.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Often, this behavior results in misunderstandings between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams have the same skill sets as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual group often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the convention team because their team may meet in a different time zone that their local coordinator may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standard for the individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
When resources are used effectively in the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity flourish.
As a result, the organizational process of working together to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new creative process of serving customers' needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating the mind. This therefore reduces the research area and makes it more precise.
The link between mental illness and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that were previously invisible.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material with which to build simulation models that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes an important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation to a machine.
AI research involves building machines to perform tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer requests and inquiries, as well as gesture, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate fields, each focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now routinely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as are many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are an integral part of any classroom. Often, a teacher likes to take his students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution to virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Virtual participation in a field trip is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capitol, the website is updated annually, but the old versions are saved online to become a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student comprehension. While students often begin their blogging experience with rudimentary grammar and spelling, this often changes when the reader is present.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to make the writing tasteful so as to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "pushes students to be smart about the world around them". The need to fill an audience's interest encourages students to be competent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "enables students to be exploratory and inquisitive; by actively responding to internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of others' poems and frame their view of particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital and offers art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
In the far south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These factors and many more, highlight Ontario as the most perfect example of Canada by outsiders.
Large areas farther north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost desert.
For a population comparison that shocks many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
At present, Madagascar is the largest, and a continent of its own as far as wildlife is concerned.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, which had a profound impact on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism followed in the 15th century, with Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India.
West Africa is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers be women because they claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also help (just don't make it look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences may lead to what they call harassment and that it is common to be followed, to have an arm pulled, and so forth.
Be firm in saying no to boys, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (culturally or otherwise, this is not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in the year 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the sultan of Morocco and given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan items, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole line of geegaws, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the streets of the town, particularly the town center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma requires research to understand the state of the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of Africa's most spectacular Mountain Gorilla tracking.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance ride.
Along with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for different and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the highlights during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands out in sharp contrast with other cities in the country, as it has more Arabic talent than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is recognised as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
In all South African National Parks, there are fees for daily maintenance and park entry.
It may also be advantageous for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to any of South Africa's park options or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is what gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is what most tourists recognize as the most important place.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is like a shimmering bar chart made more vivid by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the area claimed by British colonists and if you are looking for evidence of the area's past, it is not a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and villages in India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just swampland - they include the remnants of primeval forests that were part of the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 1,400 square miles [3,850 sq km], one of the world's three terrestrial rain forests.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 have been sighted in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (from the creek) throughout the day, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthanh as they depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, people are advised to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, and these are just as comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters long, 378 meters high and have two lanes of 3.50 wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazil's custom checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous group living today in Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also farm.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who live by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, then called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadores with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
From the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguayans found a way to perpetuate their indigenous identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
For news of the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted on the island and within Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also widely accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be; check with the owners beforehand to find out what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies south of the Equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures of over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are not unusual.
Hell can be deceptively cold: temperatures are sometimes just below freezing, but the mixture of air and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "summer" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the animals in the forests are wild and cannot be tamed and disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards [25 m] from all wildlife!
No matter how friendly they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep their distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they give up their space.
In addition, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so you should avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one of the British ships were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of Auckland's location between two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of Central Auckland.
Sometimes crowded, these family-oriented beaches with well-stocked shops line the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', a simple beer, but satisfying and refreshing.
Many French wines have a long reach, but New Zealand and Australian wines may have an even longer reach.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is relatively new - a short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is heavy cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality, and the fruit juices are similarly expensive but very tasty.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these reef agents are rare.
You still need to accept advice from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April in the northern part of the 1770's, humpbacks emerged from the beaches near the mouths of the rivers and were occasionally seen outside these seasons.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans; most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being the estuaries to the north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking can give travelers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have deals with certain hotels, but you may find it possible to book other types of accommodations, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/ from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also extend the reservation for you if you need more time to think about what is offered, or to obtain additional documentation for your destination (for example, a visa).
But any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp out on the grounds, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
It should be remembered that even after the main stages are finished, there may still be exchanges elsewhere in the festival late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the passage of ice causes the most frightening noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually try not to waste the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are often missing, and the exit can be difficult to find.
They often have special foods, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the visitors happy, and to keep them coming back.
Some places provide alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is very little friction and you cannot drive as smoothly as on unpaved asphalt.
During a blizzard, it is possible to lose enough snow in a very short period of time to become stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or heavy snow or by fog or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is generally not disrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to view Africa's impressive wildlife,
It is likely that some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are approaching the vehicles, and common equipment will give a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you may be able to see them better with binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "hiking") involves walking, whether for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets priced at ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even when the room is not occupied.
If a flat iron is not available, or if you prefer not to wear ironed socks, you can experiment with a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shortening, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are many methods of water purification, more effective against specific threats.
In some places, one minute of boiling water is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your own sealed bottled water from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in extreme cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, are not generally accepted as pests.
Duty-free shops are an opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries sometimes accumulate large sums of money, especially in such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance from Point Marion to Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often follows an isolated trail through the woods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, remain alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow streets, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are found to be lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than not.
Surprisingly, though, mobile-phone service is actually faster here than anywhere else along this route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite numerous and varied, much like their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, as apples are baked in pastries year-round, and plums can be seen in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes are often accompanied by a strong cup of coffee.
If you like small but tasty pastries, try what is regionally called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from spices and seasonings, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the continent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing the rich variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term kay seems to indicate that the dish originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available today throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes many simple ingredients, the dominant flavoring favored by the Javanese being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially sugar from the Javanese coconut), and a variety of spices.
The steps support the legs of the scaffolding hanging on either side of the frame.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a rider were thrown from a horse and caught in the stirrups, they could be pulled away by the horse. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear high-heeled, smooth-soled boots with relatively narrow soles.
Next, some frames, notably the Englis frames, have safety bars that allow the leather stirrup to fall from the frame when retracted by the fallen rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, also called South America's Yosemite, with its variety of cliffs and walls.
The summit of the mountain includes spectacular views from the summit. Climbers from all over the world continue to build new routes between the endless potential walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered ground with skis or snowboards strapped to your feet.
Skiing is ancient - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club in 1861.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep slopes and requiring tighter skis and boots.
Think of a skiing trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good weather you can cover longer distances than on foot - but you can rarely match the speed of backpacking cross- country skiers on scenic trails.
Swimming and water-related activities can be hazardous. The following are water-related hazards:
In this respect, we might say that the Schengen zone operates more like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, in most cases, you will be able to cross borders without having to go through passport-control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa in each Schengen member country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
Architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in its own right.
There are different definitions depending on geography, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called vintage, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
