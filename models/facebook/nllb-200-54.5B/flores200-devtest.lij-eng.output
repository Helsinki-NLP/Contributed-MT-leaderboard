This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but provides details that ordinary fossils cannot, such as the neck and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals were chestnut brown above, with a carrot-like or leathery underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur jaws did not have a well-developed jaw, called a rachis, but had other jaw structures - barbels and barbules - researchers infer that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other structures.
The structure of the tails suggests that they were not used in play, but rather to regulate temperament or appearance.The researchers proposed that although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the example shows the tails of a giant and not pollen grains.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flux of the plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team is now studying would be caused by the attractive force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is ejected from around the galaxy in some way, and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters sit in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes will be handed out except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend any part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya now faces charges at Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but if witness evidence is provided she could be contaminated after her image is published elsewhere.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be walking a fine line by publishing suspect photos etc".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecutions, indicated to reporters that no further comment would be made until after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years following the signing of an agreement, while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Participants in the supplemental disinfestation trial were to be closely supervised by rangers, while the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
A collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited qualified volunteers, as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for the NPWS, the four rangers selected for the initial search operation received extensive follow-up instruction and training.
Martelly appointed a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
At least 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The minister responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "very reprehensible".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management stated that no emergencies have been reported in that state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami threat.
An off-duty Philippine police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage after taking control of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six are now presumed dead.
Six of the hostages, including four children and an elderly man, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who was going to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm labor in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it accelerated fetal respiratory maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two "black box" game recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Moon walked away on the night of two moons. Beautiful and unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Moon was weird like me...maybe never again...love her and miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the poll's conclusion, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems his form was in doubt.
He could not get the medication he needed to overcome his illness, as it was forbidden by the Jews.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software starting in early February, and it was announced that afternoon.
Comets may have been a source of water; it arrived on Earth with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, as well as how the Earth formed when comets smashed into Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.
He defined the voices as "political jokes and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport has been implemented and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Transportation concerns raised the possibility of being forced to play the game behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be melted into tiny shapes.
It can be held in a thin wire, which can be twisted and turned. It can be hammered or nailed into place.
It could be cut very thinly and pasted onto another metal; so much so that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. An indicator can be made using red blood cells.
The color of the juice changes, depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried powders and then, with clean, wet hands, rinse them in a bowl.
The moisture in the air reacts with its surroundings, which feel strange and form a scummy mist.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected by a sophisticated system of pipes.
Remnants of beehive networks have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Public baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.In Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to you instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially blocks our light and vision.
It takes a rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The Internet has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the Internet has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized felids that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special behavior that each feline assumes, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and live in large groups, called prides.
Herds are made up of one to three large unrelated males, along with thirty females and juveniles.
Usually, the females are closely related to each other, forming a large family of sons and daughters.
Lion prides act much like lion or dog prides, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other felines) in behavior, and very deadly to their prey as well.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (but not very well), swim, jump great distances, and lift five times the weight of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars; these four are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of angry, angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, mice, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate and attract prey animals by their hearing, by scratching the ground where they land.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by moving around in their environment and then sitting on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, so that it can no longer survive) it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population would need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor to whatever it needed next.
The original population has not changed at all, it still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis; they also shade it.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, and consequently feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an extra one lodged in the roof of the mouth, as if to prevent escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue; its diet included trout, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also swallowed anything it came into contact with in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to swim with it.
While most of their food would have been familiar, the Romans had their share of strange or exotic feast foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, slugs, and a type of rodent called the gy.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on couches, the rich had to make tents where they could recline on a rock while consuming their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Romans ever tasted wine.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not very important.
Much of the life of a Jewish family was held in common.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the battles were just open doors leading to the street. The earth was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very scarce.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west, he found Greenland, which he named Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure" you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Above the "Declaration of Independence" were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is said that early in its life the large vellum document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was shrouded for safekeeping.
So it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated Northern France, but the South was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders as combatants.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion being codenamed "Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning "civil", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and in some ways also defines the size of a society.
City-states preceded nations; a civilized culture arises through the transmission of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and equitable diffusion.
Minoan cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, lacking an executive or a judiciary, relied on often uncooperative central authorities to enforce all its acts.
It also lacked the authority to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful national team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island group, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as "Formosa Island", or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of areas on the western and northern shores of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu develops into three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Barrows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common still photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but mainly its proportions have been inherited from the image sensor shapes of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusing: 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve, to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are at or very close to these ratios.
The much-abused and often misused rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become weak and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His all-pervading power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the earliest Christian principles is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's coffers are well stocked for this reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was sound.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law in the area, codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent seagulls from entering certain areas of the ocean, posing a danger to neutral shipping as well.
As there had been limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four books to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his college roommate) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time; each phase of China or ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of these periods is the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods there were often wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in China's ancient history, with thousands dying in battles for the top seat at the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the ambitious and successful to get ahead.
The same was true for the military, where instead of basing army ranks on class, they were now based on importance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous as "Hira", on the mountain of "Noor" (light for contemplation).
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, exhibits a very vivid picture of MoMA's spiritual leanings.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find unless you know it existed; once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful blue sky above and the many mountains below. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is dedicated to the pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "uppercase" sign looks like a "V" and the "lowercase" sign looks like a paper clip, or a square without the bottom edge.
"Up"" means you should start at the tip and push off the tail, and down means you should start at the nose (where your hand would be holding the tail) and pull off the tail.
A high pitch usually produces a softer sound, while a low pitch is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own punctuation in pencil, but remember that printed punctuation is there for a musical reason, so it should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged eleven, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
They return to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forces the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of this crowd holds up the head of a royal guard gathered at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the costs, and the interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the huge profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the primary gain of Philippine imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) period of European history.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally dated to end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a wide range of ideas, from the technology push or technological imperative in the narrow sense, that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows its own path regardless of cultural and political influence, and that game technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a high incidence of road accidents, which causes the invention of new techniques in health care, to deal with damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography developed, and these, being in harmony with the law of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury had begun around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Their status declined in the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders arrived bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were considered more valuable than those the Byzantine merchants displayed.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Moreover, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be discontinued in 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the era, following the Crusades, was that people began to use knobs to tie their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological, system that uses salvaged seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, jewelry, and jewellery.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, abuse, or willful misconduct, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "bestial" or "feral". Some feral children were confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a severely intellectually or physically disabled child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or childhood trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are thought to have been carried off by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children display behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of the particular animal being cared for, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based entrepreneurship should make it easier to start a business, and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support for people who are just beginning a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but is also the Microsoft Office stapler.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to discuss, suggest, explain procedures that may be difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are taken into care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing and educational, but it happens.
We would consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable schooling, and reliable health care.
The tenant was expected to provide whatever was needed that was missing in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines both elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and approaches to rewards.
For example, "learning"" and ""socializing"" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that take a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one could detect whether a person was about to lie by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to judge sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior may have been inherited from animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated that there are two bases for genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of manifest variation.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate, with a digestive system like a human's, to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in the leaves of legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not easily digested, but provide high amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat as modern chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is the process by which one falls asleep during the normal sleep period, and falls asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent sedative to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock so much that you fall asleep, it can be moved to the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to listen to it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve consuming lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, thus forcing one to lie down to sleep.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in his or her body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana concept of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is accessed through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing different deities, energy channels are polished, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the United States; by the end of the war, clashes over systems, processes, and culture had led to conflict between these countries.
Within two years of the war's end, the old allies were enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought over and over, by proxy armies, on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Red Army and Soviet Union troops moved in and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and supplies while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and supplies.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was actively trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Rabbits appear to have been first domesticated about ten thousand years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domesticated sheep were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by sheep herders who were often older or younger children, similar to the modern shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were simply made up of parallel axles of straw, they allowed the horses they pulled to have greater speed ratios and to pull heavier loads, compared to the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Beams were introduced specifically to hold the rails in place; however, it soon became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron point at the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron was more often worn by royalty.
Eventually, the wooden doors were replaced by iron, and the first all-iron doors were introduced in 1767.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, generally did not walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists, to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is often very similar to symptomatic treatment; however, if we want a solution that is not only temporary, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is widely acknowledged that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and that problems have increased due to overpopulation and humanity's crazy lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten envelope addressed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was mailed a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, known during the day as "Dunlap embroideries".
The document's first public reading was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the manuscript copy has not survived.
Several paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today; they are called birds.
Many people will not know about dinosaurs because they have mouths and can swim.
But there are several things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use the computer mouse.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are often so general as to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of a dangerous drug container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the container for first aid instructions specific to that particular container.
The term mite is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from our early familiarity with bed bugs, which are critters highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-building animals, and are good at living in the nest or in their host's home.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that females are twice as likely to have MS as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or their child's best interest, to raise a child.
Such couples may wish to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method; this method of inquiry guides most scientific research.
It is not, however, just experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the rise of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific networks.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological relays.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological relays are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a freewheeling cyclic period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacillus.
They performed two experiments by tagging the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphor or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material of the affected tissue, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people drive out of small towns on their way to work, and are overtaken by others whose job destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport space, everyone is connected in some way and supports a private machine-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution within the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems; almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of noise are often heard in water quality or at the bottom of wells.
Why do transportation systems generate these problems, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement between two points of traffic lanes and vehicles, and the interactions they create between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can largely be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and management of roads.
Insects were the first animals to learn how to hunt. Their ability to hunt helped them to hunt enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to scratch and scratch their heads; this gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
Also the only insects that cannot fly are insectivores and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't actually feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction on pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom prided themselves on the monuments of their predecessors, which were now well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, so much so that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People were familiar with the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because these can all be found in nature in original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was most similar to the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You have to remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver or gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a thousand billion of them could fit into the period of this sentence.
Thus, the rabbit was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
However, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a minor status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the pie when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Somewhat like dropping a heavy rock on a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km at the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and drier below the atolls.
It may have been warmer on the near side because the crust is thinner; it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on investigating what makes people behave in a certain way, or be attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or wants that have been internalized gradually as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want what they do and what things would or would not make them do certain things in their environment.
Two popular content theories are Marlow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the desire to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done, and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in splits between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet on variable schedules that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Knowing the process of an organization working together to overcome a challenge can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer requirements.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational entrepreneurship.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for a theoretical method of investigating cognition, thus narrowing the research area and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior baffles scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, or tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines, focusing on solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of these classes. Often a teacher will want to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a school trip virtually is also a way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Since students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an online audience changes things.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to focus on improving the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become experts in the world around them".The need to engage the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages entrepreneurship far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through active response to materials on the Internet, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writings and shape their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital city, and features a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more further highlight Ontario as what is considered uniquely Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wild and barely inhabited.
For a population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the world's largest island, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women who travel say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (only one that does not cost too much.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what may be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old town it is easy to find places selling traditional products such as taxis, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a range of geegaws, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a resort city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the westernmost part of the country, bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city streets, especially those in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, visits outside Goma can provide insight into the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for treks to Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest gorilla-watching in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda-boda (or motorcycle taxis); the usual fare for a short ride is about 500 CFA francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Timbuktu is also a poor city although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was a featured stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and has been designated a South African National Parks (SANParks) site.
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and entrance to the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists will find their main destination.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a glowing barcode visible from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists made their home and so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into inland Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they include some of the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water bodies or swamps.
The Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 red deer in the wild.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often expensive, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, inexpensive Japanese buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of getting around nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011; it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group among those inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guayacurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, then called the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with the original indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best football teams and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December in the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Minor tornadoes and fires may also occur at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is pegged to that of the British pound.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, at the FIC West branch.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley as well.
On outlying islands, credit cards will not be accepted, although British and US dollars may be used; check with the owners beforehand to determine which is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is winter there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, with temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely dip below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no particular "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of water stays more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to humans, wildlife is still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, they stay at least 100 yards away from bears and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, bison, elk, deer, bears, and sharks - all large animals - may attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping their distance.These animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, bear and other wild animals are known to attract deer, so avoid transporting or preparing deer food and keep the grounds clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval blockade in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk; nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamanese Lealofi III.
There are many streets, because Auckland is split between two cities; the most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore Mountains (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are warm all year with frequent snow, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The mouths of Tamaki Drive are at Waitemata Harbour, the inner reaches of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are often crowded family streets with a row of shops lining the street. Snow is common.
The main local beer is "Number One"", not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called ""Manta""".
There are many French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
The local spring water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee was foreign; a short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate is poor by Belgian standards. The fruit juices are poor but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and reef-related injuries are rare.
However, heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and heed warnings carefully.
Jellyfish are found near the shores and near the mouths of rivers from October to April north of 1770; they can sometimes be found outside these periods.
Small fish do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most small fish are fearful of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhamton.
Booking travel in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined room/hotel packages.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or questions should be discussed in advance through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most people consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
Note that although the music in the main parks may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a horrible hissing noise for those nearest it.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks, and demos, to keep the guests happy and on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house; however, drunkenness impairs judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Whether driving at certain latitudes or over mountain ranges one should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On paved and snow-covered roads the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on fresh asphalt.
In snowdrifts, enough snow may fall in a short period of time to freeze them.
Visibility may also be limited by rainfall or blowing snow or condensation, or ice on windows.
However, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to view magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars from behind and standard equipment will allow good vision.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you would see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, bushwalking safari, or walking safari) consists of an expedition, lasting several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your 2020 housing and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Storing wet clothing can help loosen it. Many hotels have iron and ironing boards available for loan, though they are not present in the room.
If a flat iron is not available, or if you are uncomfortable wearing flat shoes, you can try using a horseshoe, if available.
Be careful not to overdry the tissue (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for one minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if in doubt, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites that they are unfamiliar with in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in rare cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure and kill people, usually do not qualify as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a fair amount of money, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Mario and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, with long drives through isolated terrain in the woods.
If you are not going to drive on country roads, keep your concentration present: steep slopes, narrow lanes and rubber tyres predominate.
Published speed limits are much lower than previous and later peaks - around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these is even more important.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is considerably stronger there than along many other stretches of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
The two German states of Baden and Bavaria are rich and diverse cities, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with mashed apples falling all year, and cherries and plums making their summer appearance.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts. Folk cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands including islets, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean the food originating from central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a wide range of simply prepared dishes, the predominant flavours preferred by Javanese are pistachios, eggplants, juice (especially Javanese coconut juice) and various spices.
The stirrups are footrests for the rider that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the horse but can cause safety issues due to the possibility of a horse's legs becoming trapped underneath.
If a rider is dropped by a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be thrown if the horse runs away. A number of safety precautions can be taken to minimise this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a flat, rather narrow heel.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety coffins that allow a saddle holster to be held behind a saddling horse.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of big wall and granite cliffs.
The peaks include breathtaking mountain vistas.Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes among its endless climbing possibilities.
Downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing down a slope with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important itinerant activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations in a particular location around skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related to but usually does not involve ski mountaineering or alpine style mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances on your chest than on foot, but you will rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy pack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean going through multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
Since you are stopping in this area, you can cross borders by air without going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, keeping male reindeer as livestock.
Today, many Sami work in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although commonly used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in very different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Forecasts are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is an umbrella term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur in any part of the world and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and hailstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their air as it could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that might be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course will likely cover all of the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will typically be 2-5 days long and include role-playing, first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documentation for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender undeclared (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies widely.
Security searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people prior to surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking on a beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections and a fast current to deep water may form there.
Most fatalities occur due to fatigue while attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, getting back in is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your skill, and if you fall asleep, you may want to wait for rescue.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (it is not related to the novelty shock), lasts longer, and can have stronger effects.
People who have adapted linguistically to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
When one returns home after living abroad one is accustomed to the new culture and has lost touch with one's own native culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, because they know that living in a foreign country requires adjustments.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the area's main attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids at night and you can see them quietly before the show starts.
The noise of tourists and vendors is usually heard here. The story of sleep and light is much like that found in a book.
The Sphinx stands in the background and serves as the narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases: as of 2020 there are sixteen active ones.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the mainland, the largest island being King George Island, where the site of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the floodplain of a still-active volcano still provides a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula mix with the ocean, re-emerging to form the 225-mile (360 km) long Ellsworth Range, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, the Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (16,000 ft) at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only remaining option.
A satellite phone usually cannot replace a landline phone, since to make a call you need to be out of the house in a location that the satellite can clearly locate.
This service is frequently used by ships, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions requiring long-distance voice and data.
Your local telephone company should be able to give you more detailed information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who wish to take a gap year is to travel and do business.
It is most common among recent high school graduates, as it allows them to spend a year out of state before starting university without compromising their educational path.
In many cases, attending a course during a gap year abroad can increase the chances of entering higher education courses once one has returned to one's home country.
Usually an entrance fee is required to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is an important boating destination.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lagoons, there is little need for a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and large inland lakes are usually large enough for all yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but only by area (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the several Baltic cruises included an extended layover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
So you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and return to the ship in the evening to sleep.
If you come to the country only for an organized excursion you will not need a visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany on their advertising posters. As can be seen on the map below, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, even if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from having personal fears, dislikes, or other qualities that many other people have.
For some, gaining some insight into how an aircraft works and what happens when it crashes may be helpful in gaining a fear based on something unknown or uncontrollable.
Couriers are well paid to deliver items quickly; time is often of the essence when dealing with business papers, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some trips the larger airlines have their own planes, but for others and for smaller companies there was a problem.
If goods were shipped by air, on some routes they may have taken days to clear customs and unload.
The only way to expedite this would be to ship it as checked baggage.Airline regulations do not allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger, and this is where travelers come in.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to take out a lot of money (or, better yet, let them dictate where you work).
But convenience does not come cheap: business class usually costs up to four times as much as regular class, and first class up to eleven times as much!
As a matter of principle, there is no reason to seek discounts for first or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there are a number of travelers who would pay top dollar for the privilege of arriving at a certain destination quickly and comfortably, and they set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any European Union member states.
Although political negotiations failed, economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The majority religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of approximately 3.7 million people, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna today is a modern, developed, and densely populated center of commerce, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, some tombs are topped with interesting sculptures of marble tombs.
It is worth walking for half an hour around this intriguing village.
To the north, a short distance away, lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, known to outsiders thanks to Lord Byron's passionate description of its splendours.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo de Roca.
Also to the north, nearby is the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place where world-famous Marian apparitions are said to have occurred.
Remember that you are essentially visiting the site of a common force, and also a site that is just as invaluable to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who lived here at the time, and many others who had homes who were buried or died here after working, whether Jewish or not.
I love treating the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Just over half of the population speaks Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is by law the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but on-demand services are automatically announced in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are considered self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is largely an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to experience Paris safely is to behave as well as possible as a "well-mannered" person, so getting around the city will be much easier.
The abrupt appearance of the Parisians is very noticeable if you care to show some courtly manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and mainly comprises fir, spruce and pine, with mixed Mediterranean and alpine vegetation.
It exhibits a wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and different elevations.
This area has a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, dugout, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be found, along with many other common species.
During visits to the monastery, women are required to wear veils that reach to the knees and cross the shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide traveling blankets for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, at least one with sheets, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are also required to have their pants around their ankles.
These can also be picked up at the entrance store, but these clothes are not washed every time someone puts them on, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these clothes.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mainly pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish, especially in summer, is "bread with oil": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and spices like cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, as well as the word "Sie" which translates as courtesy, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish verbs from objects.
It probably makes reading much easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to ensure that a verb or adjective is used substantively.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The letters that require the most attention are "c" and "g", as their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Note also the different pronunciation of "r" and "rr": "caro" means "hello", "carro" means "dear".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar compendium will help you learn most of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, those who already know some Spanish may conclude, somewhat too hastily, that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to study it separately.
Most pre-modern observatories are now too old to be used, and serve as museums or training sites.
Because light pollution was not as much of a problem in the good old days as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, and are easier to maintain than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures located in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
The upward-facing view, known as hakami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where robber barons were held in high esteem.
In Japan, the first sky festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy attached to the imperial court.
Plants look best in natural settings, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
When visiting a garden organized according to formal criteria, removing "specimens" for collection will also be punished by expulsion from the garden, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and easy place to move around, and once you arrive you can buy almost anything you need.
But because it lies in the "high tropics", a few degrees above the equator, you have to contend with both the sunset (when the sky is overcast) and the sunrise (when the sky is overcast, which happens more often).
There are also buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional resting place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and his wife.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish site of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for a vacation.
For example to visit castles in the upper Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or to cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or to sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes of travel and popular hiking trails among people.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays for Christians, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter Vigil up in the sky to watch the sun rise.
It is understood that there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning celebrations at midnight Sunday to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that formerly arrived here did so by land, sea, or air.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals could not complete the journey, so in the Galapagos the giant tortoise is the main game animal.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, a large number of mammals have been introduced, including horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you may experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be clear all day long.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and thus light pollution is often not a problem, they might as well enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that encountered in the West.
Clothing is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, and emphasizing team effort is more important than praising individual success.
Workers often must obtain permission from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to obey their superiors' commands without question.
