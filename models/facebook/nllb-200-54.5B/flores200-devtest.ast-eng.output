This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory; it also provides details missing from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional distribution.
Scientists believe that the plumage of this animal was dark brown above and carotenoid below.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
As the dinosaur does not have a well-developed cane or rachis, but does have other characteristics such as feathery and feathery beards, the researchers concluded that it is likely that the rachis developed later than the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for nesting.
The scientists suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
In the same way that the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy is bound around the surrounding galaxy, and is composed of many particles.

However, it is consistent with them being large holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the United States Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is generally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferences.
After the polling station verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and seals the voters' sheet.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes other than those of counted and authorized voters are mixed in.
Individual candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the afternoon, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Parks and Heritage Conservation for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first round were fully trained in safety and training.
Martelly was sworn into office in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to thousands of anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests led to their inability to organize elections, some of which were to be held in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 accidents involving the devices had been reported to them.
A week ago, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the Apple report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:10 pm Friday GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported nationwide.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami signal.
A former Philippine police officer holds several Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and there are at least six confirmed casualties.
Six hostages were released, including the miners and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then occupied the seat of an elderly woman as she went to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynaecologist and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation could be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Far Side. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Quite unique like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as rare as I am...you might like her more...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by eight percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would have become a republic by the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of people in the poll shared this view, wanting Elizabeth II of England to be Australia's last monarch.
The poll found that 29 per cent of respondents believed Australia would be a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed Australia would never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because it is forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered "the highest prime" on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with hardware and software tests in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water brought to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins that support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says would allow aircraft to make shorter flights, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and to give more accurate information to pilots.
There is no overnight transport and surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and short-term parking are not available on the surface.
The fear of lack of transportation opened up the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the presence of the teams' fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process is assumed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be formed into many shapes.
It can be made into fine wire, for handling and braiding.
It can be left very thin and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate miniature books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using lobster juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or soft (alkaline) the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of oxygen ions (the pH H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two handfuls of dry powder and then, with clean, wet hands, squeeze it into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in virtually every house, linked to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public bathing houses where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space on a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere alters some of the light and vision.
It takes a 100-foot-tall rocket to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the invention did for us was provide faster and more efficient transportation.
We brought the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of success is the niche concept, a special job that each of the cats has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Broods consist of one to three related males along with up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually related to each other, forming a large family of daughters and sisters.
Lion taming works similarly to that of wolves or dogs, animals that closely resemble lions (though not other big cats) in their behavior and are also very harmful to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete: it can screech (though not very well), swim, jump good distances and pull five times the force of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the mighty roar of the lion, it is like a phrase of hoarse words gleamed.
Ocelots are good at eating small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots search for and find animals to eat (hunt) by scent, scratching for their trail in the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very slowly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the original population (they go to live in the mountains or the river, or they move to an island, from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed a thing, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapted to their new environment, they began to resemble each other less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., throw away)
Plants make their food by photosynthesizing the sun. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its large jaws have over 70 razor-sharp teeth with extra clearance in the roof of the mouth, meaning there is no escape for anything in its path.
We're not entirely sure, but he may have had a forked tongue.
It attacked anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was a match for it.
While most of their food was familiar, the Romans had a good deal that was strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their food sitting on chairs, rich men make puddles together where they will lie on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, they didn't have tomatoes, they didn't have potatoes, they didn't have cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered to be the house of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests attended to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctum into which only priests may enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of the life of the Hebrew family was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were counters facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no major forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while travelling west, found Greenland and named it after himself.
But regardless of this discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each of the countries is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that initially, the parchment (29.75 by 24.50 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it seems likely that the notation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated the North, but the South was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy side, who were the French who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a representative group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that, in some way, defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves passing on knowledge over many generations, a cultural imprint that is maintained and an important spread.
Minority cultures are often wiped out without leaving historically relevant traces and are not properly recognized as civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, relied on uncooperative state legislatures to pass all laws.
It also had no authority to nullify tax legislation or tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states paid so little attention to the central government that representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the grouping of islands that the country has, Japan is in geographical terms an archipelago.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1627, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan; they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings outside the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more reliable idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still-image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but most importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, paradoxically, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by 12 to reach the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (of the APS family, for example) have the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, so abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
He states that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history the Catholic Church, which had gained wealth and power, came under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had united different European states for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and culture.
Its overwhelming power affects all strata of society, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist for just that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led to questions about whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the start of the engagement, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off military and civilian supplies, although this blockade had violated generally accepted international law and ratified several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was poor, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of war in World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces, the best known of which is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods there were fierce wars between nobles fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China.
It led to many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to its people and not to a single leader.
In addition, with the Revolution, the posts were opened to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and wealthy to succeed.
The same is true of the army because instead of class-based military ranks they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes in other countries to organize their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters of this worldly life. He used to go to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca is this cave, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know of its existence.
You can't see anything but the beautiful clear sky and the surrounding mountains. Few things of this world fit into this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid constructions commissioned by the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were created to honor his wives and relatives.
The "bow up" indication resembles a V and the "bow down" indication a staple or square without the bottom line.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the hook (where your hand is on the bow) and pull the bow.
An upper bow produces a softer sound, while a lower bow is louder and more assertive.
You can make notes, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for musical reasons and must be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (eleven-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Isabella of France, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a crowd of female market workers.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people cheering and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the Philippine war were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to defray a large part of the expenses and interest of the bonds advanced on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Since then, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos have been the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time in which the events take place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Early High Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a wide range of ideas, ranging from the technological drive or technological imperative to a narrower sense in which human destiny is dominated by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path very distant from political or cultural influence and that technology, in turn, has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily encourages the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable with only a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The possession of a large number of cars also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new sanitary techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had much in the way of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures linked to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is seen as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was then that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style emerged in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially clothing in the East was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 or 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the period was that people began to use buttons to tie their clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often ecologically sound system that uses ecological farming together with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers developed subsistence agriculture and this is what happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures group together like-minded individuals who feel rejected by society's standards and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a culture to be distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their membership by the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashions, gestures, and slang.
One of the most common methods of showing the importance of socialization is to point to the few and unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck or premeditated abuse, were not socialized with adults while growing up.
Some have been confined (usually by their own parents or others); in some cases this abandonment of children is due to the parents' rejection of a severely physically or mentally disabled child.
Young children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are supposed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animals that cared for them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but an aid that supports individuals who are going through a learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office clipboard.
Virtual scaffolds are inserted into the software and are intended to question, recall and explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to navigate on their own.
Children go into foster care for many reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child would thrive in an environment where there is no care, education and affection, but they do.
We believe that foster care is a safe environment for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, caring caregivers, regular education and quality health care.
Foster homes are supposed to put whatever resources they lacked into the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The peculiarities of the Internet point to additional dimensions in which the theory of uses and gratifications changes.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and relationships with continuity were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it ensures that no one can detect if someone is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage are, in fact, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He goes on to suggest that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two gene pools: taped and expressed.
Mutation combines genetic variation and qualitative selection of the set of variation expressed.
Segregation and recombination generate variation between two gene pools each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, poor nutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to find would be protein from leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
For example, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but provides proteins containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" the same way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of voluntarily waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a quiet alarm clock that wakes you without waking you up.
If you find yourself turning the clock off while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life energy is. Each person has the capacity to achieve complete peace and joy.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that can stop us is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is primarily centred on Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love and acceptance.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and conscious enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which made the USSR and the United States cooperate. After the war, clashes between systems, processes and culture led to the distance of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would actually be fought by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was broken, the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, after more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Armies are responsible for ensuring that your country maintains its ability to move citizens and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable near-term examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States was trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies fail, it is likely that Germany will conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zargos Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes organized forests for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds in the mountains or other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds, who were often children or young men, in a manner similar to the better-known shepherds.
The first railways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although wagonways were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to gain more speed and carry larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were soon introduced to support the tracks; gradually, however, it was realised that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The earliest known form of transport is walking. Humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Australopithecus, its predecessor, did not walk upright very often.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It's like a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we only want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to deactivate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's advances in science and technology; the problems are only growing due to overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's nearby printing press.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 June, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 pictures known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and sneeze.
Although there are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and spurs, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T. rex.
Almost all modern computers handle information encoded in the binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to make an early diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects adapted to parasitize humans.
Bed bugs and other small insects make nests, adapting to live in the host's nest or house.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not what is best for them or what is best for them.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents lose their parental rights so that another couple can have them over the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions, and making observations and guiding scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have seen that rhythms in psychology and behavior depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their manifestation in internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, are documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue in a free-cycling period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was conclusive in determining that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by tagging either the phage DNA with a radioactive phosphor or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfide.
Mutations can have several effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material fragment and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells have genetic transmission, although other types of mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks to study information about their ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and meet people who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is connected and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this coal-intensive economy displaced the biosphere from one of the stable states that facilitated human evolution within two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
In developed countries you almost never find the same level of complaint about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they do so on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to have reasonably uniform behavior; therefore, traffic flows are often reasonably constant and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and carrying out road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their sniffing ability helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and reproduce more easily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, the only insects that cannot sweeten their wings are devils horses and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems to be what our senses perceive, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world because at some points it reaches 6 miles.
Twenty percent of the water that reaches the oceans from the rivers of the planet does so from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors which were already well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the most sparsely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and communication.
Italian is the usual language of most state workers, while Latin is also used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
Some basic chemical elements such as gold, silver or copper have been known since antiquity, and can all be found in nature as native metals, being easily extracted using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that all things are made of mixtures of one or more elements, which were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles, atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that you could fit trillions of them into the period that ends this sentence.
Thus, with his invention the pencil made life easier for many people.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to touch a keyboard.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb uses the principle that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to collide with little or no pushing.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the seas and larger in the highlands.
There may have been more tides on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have some needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours arise from managers attempting to manage their former colleagues.
This type of boss has a hard time making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning positions, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one mutates and becomes an unknown individual who feels he must change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups have the same standards of excellence as conventional ones, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than the conventional members of a team since they can meet according to different time zones, something that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for its members.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization?
When all available resources across the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can occur.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle by an organization can encourage a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous perspective as a method used for organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data show physical evidence of a theoretical approach to cognition research, so the area of investigation narrows and becomes much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage of various types, trauma, injury, and tumors affect our behavior and cause changes in various mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
That gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI sounds like something out of science fiction, it is an important part of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence aims to make machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices and faces.
Such topics have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to everyday problems.
AI systems are now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been built into many personal computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Sometimes, the teacher will take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology provides a solution with virtual field trips. Pupils can view museum objects, visit an aquarium or view works of art while in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a helpful way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to Capital City; they redesign the old one, but keep the versions to serve as templates.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students start the blog with sloppy grammar and spelling, pressure from the audience often changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog tries to improve the writing to prevent such criticism.
Participating in a blog also "enables students to gain greater knowledge of the world around them".[22] The need to spark public interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an activity that encourages collaboration and motivates students to learn outside of school as well.
The good use of blogs "motivates students to critical analysis; with active exposure to content on the Internet, students define their opinions with the texts of other people and form their position on concrete issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's capital of charm and bilingualism, with many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north harbors the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka area and beyond.
All this and more makes Ontario basically Canadian to outsiders.
There are large areas in the north with little population, some of which are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself when it comes to animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts and beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, with special emphasis on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women state that they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It helps a lot to wear a ring (though not one that looks very expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they consider to be sneaking, and it is not uncommon for them to follow, hold hands, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, you are not acceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established bases there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tahine, pottery, leather goods, pipes and a number of trinkets, all designed for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be informed about the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places in all of Africa to hike to see mountain gorillas.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a makeshift city, although its reputation has made it a tourist city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage monuments in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' special "Wonders of the African Word" on PBS.
The city is a sharp contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an air more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of life.
It is one of South Africa's top tourist attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for South Africa's national parks, they have conservation and park access fees.
It can be a bonus for one to buy a Wild Car, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists come for the main attraction.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape have been compared to a glossy bar graph, aided by the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon seafront just opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbarns is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into inland Bangladesh and Indian territories.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not of mangrove type, but retain remnants of the majestic jungles that covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is wetland.
The Sundarbarns has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966; there are currently about 400 Bengal tigers and 40,000 cheetahs in the area.
Buses leave the intermodal station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east or to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are quick and convenient means of getting to nearby areas such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge across the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.5 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, called "the giant province of the Indies" was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The largest annual competition is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Here you can see more modest tournaments or matches at other times of the year.
For tournament news and information on buying tickets for polo matches, see Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the Bank of the Islands in Stanley (opposite the FIC West store).
Pound sterling is generally accepted on the islands and Stanley also accepts credit cards and US dollars.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British or U.S. currency is accepted.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months temperatures above 30 ° C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combined air and temperature make it feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There is no special "wet" or "dry" season: rainfall remains the same practically throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the animals are tame and should not be disturbed or fed.
According to park authorities, a distance of at least 100 yards must be maintained from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife!
As tame as they may seem, bison, elk, bears, and other large animals can attack you.
Each year, many visitors are injured because they do not go far. These animals are large, clumsy and potentially dangerous, so their space must be respected.
Keep in mind that odors attract bears and other types of animals; better avoid bringing food or cooking tasty dishes and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The shell was the scene of an infamous naval engagement in 1889 when seven German, British and American ships refused to leave.
Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the main chief Tupua Tamamese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two bays. The most popular are in three areas.
The sands of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean; they extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are safe sandy beaches and most have areas with shady pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually family-run beaches with a variety of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not complex but pleasant and fresh.
There are numerous types of French wine to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Tap water in the area is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are not careful.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is somewhat foreign. A single coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and the tea is drunk without milk.
The calcium chocolate is at the Belgian level. The juice is expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow recommendations, obey signs, and take safety precautions.
Box jellyfish appear near sandbanks and rivers from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist; however, they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live entirely in the sea; their primary habitat is rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and a place to sleep when arriving at the destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to find other accommodation such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include lunch, airport transportation, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be handled with the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most attendees choose to camp, and for many it is an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stages you have to say before to camp close to the music.
Note that although the music ends on the main stages, there will be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until very late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, look where the cabin is: if you sail on ice there is too much noise.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city; cruise passengers do not need a visa to enter Saint Petersburg (see terms).
Casinos strive to maximize the time and money spent by patrons; there are often no windows or clocks and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offers, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them on the premises.
However, being drunk is the same as being out of bowls and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you had bare asphalt.
In blizzards, enough snow can fall to block you in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow or blizzards or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic runs without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a significant experience for visitors.
The popular term safari is used to refer to overland journeys to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially that of the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars and the standard equipment allows good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be skittish and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "savanna walk", "hiking safari" or simply "walking") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Winter Olympics twice, having previously hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before it was postponed, you may be in a difficult situation.
Policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellations do not cover July 2020, the dates of the Games.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average price of ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there are no irons or you are uncomfortable ironing even your socks, you can try using a dryer (if you have one).
Take care that fabrics do not reach high temperatures (which can cause them to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn)
There are different ways of filtering water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies and if you have a concern you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods that are exempt from direct and indirect taxes in some places.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, often passing through isolated and rough terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
Signal speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to stay within them.
Strangely, cell phone service is much more robust here than many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apple as a year-round ingredient and plum and cherry appearing in the summer.
Many German pastries feature almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular pastries often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try rich dumplings, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" according to the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used with curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term for the country's huge variety of regional cuisines.
However, if no other adjectives are used, the term refers to food originally from central and eastern Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple dishes. The predominant flavor is that of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and some aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supported by the rider's feet which hang on either side of the saddle.
They give more stability to the rider but can compromise safety because of the risk of foot binding.
If a rider falls from a horse but has his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a soft, thin sole.
To the rear, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the saddle if a rider is pulled off it while falling.
Cochamó Valley - main destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and boulders.
The summits have incredible views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between their endless potential of walls.
Downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is an activity with many fans, sometimes called "skiadictos", who plan entire trips to ski in a specific area.
The idea of skiing is an old one - cave paintings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: also called cross-country skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
It is related to but usually does not involve skiing or mountaineering, as both are done on level ground and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a mountain trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover longer distances than by walking - but only very rarely will you be able to reach the speed of backpack-free cross-country skiing on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal conditions, traveling to many countries would mean having to apply for many visas and go through passport controls many times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions as if it were a single country in this respect.
While you are in this zone, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you do not need to apply for visas for each member country of the area; you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal consensus on what products are antiques; some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically; the legal age may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be considered antiques, even if they are more modern than some mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life among the Sami and the culture surrounding the profession is important to many workers in other professions as well.
Even traditionally, not all Sami participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, leaving reindeer as draft animals for the most part.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although its use is widespread, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel cancellation insurance or doctor may be concerned.
You may want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East will have to deal with more extreme situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a generic term for any weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe problems or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and comes in several types, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, landslides, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risk of thunderstorms in their area, as they could affect their plans.
Anyone who plans to go to a country they consider a war zone will receive vocational training.
If you search the Internet for "wild boar routes" you are likely to find signs for local businesses.
A course will generally cover all the topics discussed here in detail, often with hands-on experiences.
A course will normally last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to have sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have all valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender designation (X) or updated documents with the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints became much more annoying in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Pre-operative transgender people cannot expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking off the beach, often on a pier or similar.
Because of the submarine topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper sections and can form a fast current for deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get to a place where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your skill or whether you've been seen, you might be better off waiting for rescue.
Reintegration shock comes earlier than culture shock (the infatuation phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have no difficulty adjusting to a new culture often have difficulty adjusting to their own native culture.
When you return home after living abroad you are adapted to the new culture, even if you lose some of the habits of the long-distance culture.
By telling the foreigner first, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People do not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The light and music show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for breakfast.
You can see the pyramids at dusk and you can see them in silence before the show ends.
You constantly hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of light and sound is like a fairy tale.

Finland is a wonderful sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes it is not necessary to have a yacht.
