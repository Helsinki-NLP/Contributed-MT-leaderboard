A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco supermarket.
This week, a 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a department store.
But the victim's brother says he cannot think of anyone who would want to harm his brother, stating: "Her life was finally starting to improve".
The body found Wednesday outside a Westfield supermarket has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
San Francisco police have ruled his death a homicide and are investigating.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells San Francisco's ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago, he landed his dream job at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco.
A representative for Sons and Daughters said they were shocked and saddened to learn of his death.
"We are a small team working as a close-knit family, and he will be greatly missed", said a spokesman.
Our thoughts are with Frank's friends and family at this difficult time.
Luis Galicia says that at first Frank stayed in hostels, but recently things have improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl", Luis tells KGO-TV.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He was always helping his family by preparing a good meal and making lunches", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in controversy.
He was the brother who adapted to others.
"With everything that was going wrong in the world", he says, "he was a diamond in the rough, sparkling every day".

Young doctors strike: call for new protests
New doctors' representatives are asking their union to launch a protest in a dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Young Doctors Committee (YDC) is preparing to ask the council to support wider protests in early September.
JAK considers that the ministers have not succeeded in dispelling doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected a contract offered by the LMA.
The Treaty was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK board member Ellen McCourt said the government's silence on the matter meant the contract offer was rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, as a result of the JAC vote, the contract offer has been rejected in its entirety and a decision has been taken to request new formal talks to discuss the key issues.'
Responding to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA board to authorize the drafting of new contracts to take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors took part in six strikes, including, for the first time in the history of the NHS, a work stoppage.
Following the vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA and recommended by the BMA, the representative of the new doctors at the LMA, Dr Johans Malawana, resigned from his post.
Before a meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that a contract would be awarded to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of the excluded?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to declare an end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at St Petersburg's presidential palace, it seemed that Ankara needed this partnership more.
Nevertheless, the two men lined up.
Vladimir Putin's smile seemed composed and did not evoke warm emotions, even considering his usual restraint.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan referred to Putin as his "dear friend" at least five times, according to a summary of the meeting.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels but become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is a mixed blessing.
But Putin's coolness suggests that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the downing of a Russian plane near the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offense was all the more painful because it came from a friend.
Rebuilding genuine trust will be very difficult, if not impossible.
Since November, however, Russia's public attitude has changed.
For months, government-controlled television broadcast aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame.
The most serious were allegations that Erdogan's own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He denied it, of course.
But the main message from the St. Petersburg summit is that it's time to put the past behind us.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia might see this as a victory of sorts.
Ankara's gains from the peace settlement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after last month's failed coup attempt to oust him.
Countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which normally bring millions of Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists dropped by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe a sigh of relief when scheduled flights resume.
They're hoping for a Mediterranean holiday fever at the end of the season.
Already this week, state TV is predicting a drop in fruit and vegetable prices due to the resumption of Turkish fruit and vegetable imports.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti put it: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us".
However, there were also other political motives behind the visit from Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West over what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
There is also dissatisfaction with the protracted accession negotiations with the EU and the intervention of Putin, who is keen to exploit Turkey's alienation from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained points with Ankara by expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it has deep-seated fears of regime change in the country.
The summit, held in this picturesque seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present what one analyst called an "alliance of the discarded", two countries that feel rejected by the West.
However, despite this public display of unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
After more than three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility and a potential disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
SKB's brand will continue to have a supporting role, the bank's CEO announced.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank was close to bankruptcy and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to give prominence to other national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all references to SKB outside the head office and official listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be considered.
MacEwan was interviewed during a visit to customers and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "SKB will become our investor brand and our employee brand because we are now becoming more than a brand bank".
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with clients under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will no longer sponsor the Six Nations and will involve different brands in the sponsorship of the sport.
'The time is right to become a brand bank, because we have been asking ourselves for a long time how to become a better bank for our customers,' says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical for us to say that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But through hard work and by focusing on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs, we've obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Dettori scores his 3,000th victory by taking first place at Newmarket with Predilection.
Dettori pops the champagne to claim his 3,000th victory by finishing first twice at Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Dettori claimed his 3,000th victory in British racing history, taking first place at Newmarket.
He achieved this by taking his second victory in this race, held in his hometown, riding a Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to do so in a sprint race.
He is joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pete Adair and William Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who had previously won with Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm very excited because my family is here.
I'm really glad it happened in Newmarket, because I've lived here for 30 years.
It's not a big race, it's not Royal Ascot, it's just another Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After their victory, Dettori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in steeplechase racing - champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who set several records with more than 4,300 career victories.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner of the Derby, has won 4,493 races in his career.
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of the modern era and it's no surprise that he has achieved success that few can match.
He's stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactics sets him apart from other jockeys.
He's a fantastic representative of racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago at Epsom, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he hadn't been racing only on weekends and big races.
But in all seriousness, Frankie has been a regular winner in Britain for 30 years.
He has a good sense of humor, which is very useful in British racing, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Dettori celebrated this achievement with his trademark flying decision.
From windswept finishes to flying colts, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for 20 years.
This has been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 Grand Slam at Ascot, and has survived a plane crash and a doping ban.
Three years ago, he struggled to return after a six-month suspension, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who doubted him by returning in top form.
Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue racing until he is at least 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Former Head of the Federal Migration Service office for Sevastopol.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed special representative for the environment and transport.
He was one of the co-signatories of the 'treaty on Crimea's accession to the Russian Federation' of 18 March 2014.
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a fearless diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and later worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
As a former Government Minister, shares responsibility for the regime's violent repression against the civilian population.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
In my view, the main task of the administration is to support your work as President of the Republic by drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian news agency on Friday that Ivanov had voluntarily resigned and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Does a smile work?
The move has rattled Moscow.
Former Head of the Federal Migration Service office for Sevastopol.
In this capacity, he was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
In a nationally televised meeting, the two men announced that Ivanov was stepping down of his own accord.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few are convinced by such an explanation, especially before a parliamentary election.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows.
However, the official claim that a man once considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become Russia's head of environmental policy is viewed with great skepticism.
In remarks published on the Kremlin website, Ivanov tells Putin: "The fact is that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult, one might even say problematic, post for four years.
Turns out I've been on the job four years and eight months.
Former Head of the Federal Migration Service office for Sevastopol.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and a former employee of the State Security Service of the KGB, like Putin.
In late 1990, Putin headed the FSB, the successor to the KGB, and Ivanov became his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanova as one of the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for President of Russia, as re-electing Putin for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister and returned to the presidency after three and a half years.
Mysterious appearance of fish in a garden in Banff
A man from Banff asks for help in identifying the species of fish in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bean thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels that traveled by water column.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 1,600 feet [500 m] from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the video-sharing website Periscope, hoping that someone would know how this two-inch [5 cm] fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Junction: the bridge is now connected to Fife.
Currently, the GBP 1,35 billion project is scheduled for completion in May 2017.
Engineers have linked the northern end of the Queensferry crossing to the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The first of the four connecting sections is complete, meaning that the bridge is nearing completion.
The Faifa Bridge structure is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, the GBP 1,35 billion project is scheduled for completion in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown was at the construction site today and was one of the first to step onto the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge".
In this project, we see an incredible feat of engineering, with more than 30,000 tonnes of cement and steel used in the construction of this section alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, the joining of the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process, requiring great precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the deck is now complete and the final section connecting the bridge to Rosita will be installed today, which means that all sections of the bridge are ready for loading.
Michael Martin, project manager of the fourth bridge link, explains: "The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge".
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates world-class engineering.
After installing the last section of road and connecting it to the support of the north tower, we had to connect the northern section of road to the ground section, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the northbound span 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and delicate operation.
The viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and has a gradient of about 3 percent.
Delicate because the tolerance in both directions that the team was working with was only a few millimeters.
Luckily, it all worked out.
Simone Biles takes gold in the women's gymnastics.
Forget about the verdict.
Forget about the excitement.
Simon Bales doesn't care about any of this.
Dynamically leaping.
Performs exercises on the beam effortlessly.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Perfectly innocent.
And last but not least, an Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won the gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62.198 was a head-court advantage over silver medalist and teammate Aliya Raisman and bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina of Russia.
On Thursday, American gymnast Simone Biles performed on the balance beam in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American to win the all-around title and the fifth top-ranked gymnast, gradually cementing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears because her long journey had come to an end.
This achievement puts him alongside such undefeated athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
For the past three years, she has dominated her sport, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, performing combinations of exercises so brilliant, precise, and ambitious that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I have ever seen".
In Brazil she faced her final test, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her rather than with other athletes.
She would be disappointed if I returned to my home in Spring, Texas without my gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simone Biles (left) and Aliya Raisman cheer after winning gold and silver medals respectively in the women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles won her first gold medal Tuesday at a special send-off party for national team coordinator Martha Carolla.
Although Biles claims that she never expected anything like this during her long rise to fame, it is not true.
Part of her free-flowing performance, which includes her signature acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly in the street near the Rio Olympic Stadium.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was an infant and discovered by trainer Amy Boorman's mother on a field trip to the gym where the Boorman Trials were held has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn't lost a singles match since the summer of 2013, and that streak can continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Although Mustafina was slightly ahead during the two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The balance beam and free movement portion of the competition, where Biles will defend his title, is just ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15.433 on the beam and extended her lead with a score of 15.933 free throws.
Raisman hugged her tenderly as she waited for the results, which were only a formality, and she burst into tears of joy at the realization of a dream she had once written down in her notebook.
Raisman's result was a small revenge for the events of four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the bronze medal match.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, took a commanding lead.
After a performance in the free skating that dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate an air kiss to the effort.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old Biles' viral Twitter post, which she posted this week, now has a whole new meaning.
Six-year-old Mahy Brown survives being shot in Philadelphia.
Police say a 6-year-old boy is believed to have been shot in Philadelphia, making him the second 6-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's parents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia News that the child is Mahy Brown.
Parents say Brown was shot multiple times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station: "His little body was just mangled by the flames".
I can't believe this.
The boy is hospitalized in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
His family says he's expected to make a full recovery.
He was about to start first grade at the local primary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia is reporting that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of them was the attacker.
An investigator told CBS Philadelphia that multiple shooters may have been involved.
We've recovered shell casings from multiple weapons at the scene.
Looks like it was a sustained firefight.
Shells found on both sides of the pedestrian walkway.
"So it looks like there were multiple gunmen who actively participated in the shooting", said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Several homes and cars were also damaged.
No arrests have yet been made and police are reportedly checking CCTV footage.
On Tuesday, a stray bullet struck a six-year-old girl in the arm while she was playing in front of her home in West Oakland.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon and Gabi and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Track and Field Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been this good.
Secondly, this team has three athletes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are an inspiration to many young indigenous girls.
People can be proud that this team includes Aliya Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic.
At the end of the day, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Hispanic athletes in the sport.
For the last four years, the number one gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby came in first and second.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America rejoiced.
Now the world has seen incredible moves by three-time world champions Simon Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but masterful moves.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's individual all-around.
Her teammate Aliya Raisman won the silver medal.
We've seen the best this sport has to offer, but in the rest of the country, it's a completely different story in gym class.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie made the Olympic trials, as did Allie and Madison.
They're the Olympic Five because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four athletes, and this is coach Martha Carroll's last year as coach.
Athletes train mainly in private athletic clubs and are supported by their parents, who pay for training, accommodation, travel, uniforms, hotels (for trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in areas of cities that can afford the sport.
In these clubs, athletes carry out all their training, which is an expensive and long-term investment for athletes' families.
Amy Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have coached their athletes since both girls began competing in track and field.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simone and Gabby and Laurie with more affordable gym memberships.
I started my athletic association 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Harlem, and we offer free or low-cost exercise training to more than 15,000 inner-city youth, mostly black and Hispanic, and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit, my hometown, to introduce local youths to this wonderful sport.
Athletics develops strength, agility, and coordination, as well as hard work, discipline, and focus.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success in school and work.
This team is going to inspire thousands of young girls to train for track and field, and that's fantastic.
Playing the sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Ali, Gabby and Madison for a great demonstration of Girl Power, winning Olympic gold medals and inspiring countless young girls from all backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer, junior doctors are planning more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association on changes to the contract, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude the contract, stating that the NHS was in a fragile state and further delays would only hurt staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes to working conditions for night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, the BMA's junior doctors' representative, Dr Ellen McCourt, announced that junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will exacerbate the labour crisis and that it does not provide a level playing field for all doctors.
There are only eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors sign their new contracts, so we need to make progress, because time is running out.
The BMA's attempts to find a negotiated solution have been met with government reluctance to engage and sometimes total silence.
This is despite the fact that just last month Jeremy Hunt said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action to end his inactivity and work with the new doctors.
If he doesn't, the young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments were postponed as nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone on strike.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the weekend rate for the 54 000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
NHS employment chief executive Daniel Mortimer has urged junior doctors not to strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes solve nothing but increase pressure on overworked staff and cause anxiety, stress, and delay for patients, caregivers, and their families.
Over the last two months, we've been talking to a new committee of doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we've responded positively to their questions about guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active co-operation on other important issues, such as job placements, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, early school leaving and the gender pay gap in medicine, will show that employers, HEIs and the Department of Health are serious about implementing the agreements reached with BME in November, February and May.
Two grams a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of heart-attack patients could be treated with the two-ounce-a-day drug because officials are recommending it for more people and for longer periods.
The contraceptive medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
These medicines are already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack.
NICE, on behalf of the NHS, recommends using it for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE, which is currently overseen by the NHS, recommends that it be used for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Each year about 140,000 people in England have a heart attack, and of these, a quarter have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fat in the walls of the heart, forming plaques.
If the blockage ruptures, it can form a clot, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if a blood clot breaks loose from the wall of a blood vessel, it can travel deeper into the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca in the UK and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
New NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take Ticagrelor 90 mg twice a day for 12 months and then 60 mg twice a day with aspirin for a further 3 years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of health technology at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of drugs to prevent a second heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had one will have another, often with serious consequences".
Fear of another heart attack can adversely affect a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had one.
By provisionally recommending Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend treatment to thousands of people who will benefit from it.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding with its use for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from office for corruption.
A government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to widespread cheating in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes the police, election observers, and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of "fear of offending ethnic and religious interests".
A former communal secretary who is now the head of an anti-corruption organization says that voter intimidation on religious grounds is so widespread that the police should be allowed to post guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should show an identity card when they vote to prove their true identity.
At present, voters need only give their name and address.
He even suggests marking voters' fingers with special ink to prevent double voting.
Whistleblowers also need greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working parties.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in elections but also to protect local governments from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes with it".
The report was commissioned by Downing Street after the scandal surrounding the Tower Hamlets by-election.
Last year, a special election court ruled to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman from office for corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
'Rahman campaigned on the belief that it was the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.'
About 300 votes were fraudulent or doubtful because one person voted more than once.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
Of particular concern, he said, was fraud in postal voting, where elderly members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the use of identity cards to verify identity.
His report states: "There is evidence that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and youth, are coerced into voting for candidates chosen by their elders, especially in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities".
"There is a concern that regional authorities are not addressing these issues because of political correctness, which could harm ethnic and religious interests".
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, including a ban on political activists handling postal votes to prevent vote-buying.
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for more rigorous registration checks to prevent voter lists being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
To mark voters' fingers with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically verify the nationality of persons to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Establish a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from handling postal votes and postal ballot envelopes.
Ensure that the police are empowered to guard polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Ban photography at polling stations.
Require the use of English only in constituencies (except in Wales).
Strengthen training for polling station staff to ensure that voters go to the polls individually.
Sir Eric has sharply criticised the Metropolitan Police for failing to press charges in the Towerhamlet case.
He says: "The electoral court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his deputy for activities related to corruption and fraud".
He was convincingly found guilty by the criminal justice standard of proof based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "cookie checking" of voters by the city council at voter registration stations.
"Last year's court decision is a wake-up call", says Sir Eric.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretence of institutions that fraud does not occur threatens this good reputation.
Cycling enthusiasm - Kate's peers and fellow Rio Olympic celebrities
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics will be thrilled by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who fans have identified as striking a resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete competing for gold this summer who, according to media reports, is bragging about her celebrity rival.
So in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has put together a list of Olympic athletes who look exactly like Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. archer Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's cycling partner, many people online are suggesting that this archer could be superstar Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused a Twitter storm when photos were posted of him looking very much like the Wolf of Wall Street.
The athlete himself took to social media and admitted that he has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much resemblance except for the beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment".
This year, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on one of the most popular pairings at the 2012 London Olympics: the striking resemblance between British long-distance runner Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina has been compared to Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan because of her large expressive eyes.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has for years been compared to Matthew Morrison of "Born to Run" fame.
Changes: This user has noticed that Nathan is a 'sporty version' of the actor from the movie 'Inception'.
Other former teammates include tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver-medal-winning swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalyn McCord boast more than sunburned skin and blond hair, while fans consider American athlete Nathan Adrian to be Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Women in hats: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial features and eyes.
Not alone: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others see these similarities too.
Theory: This user thinks there might be a reason why the two look so similar.
Recently, one Twitter user gleefully announced that "the rest of the internet seems to agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical".
The American football star and the "Dexter" actress do have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney.
A CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying that a Chinese swimmer 'ended up like a pig.'
Byron McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanha's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay sent shockwaves through CBC viewers.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "ran out of the race stinking" and "ended up like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he gave his personal opinion at the end of the women's 4×200 m freestyle relay final.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to add liveliness to the commentary, said: "That little 14-year-old Chinese girl can't keep up".
"After the race, she ran out of the race stinking and ended up as a pig".
Thank you very much.
Fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan's time of 1:57.79 in the second round was 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to catch China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted online as they were shocked to hear such tone and language.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC live commentator just say a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'ended up like a pig'????".
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.
Ai Yanha of China in the women's 4x200m freestyle final was named "China's little 14-year-old who doesn't carry".
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly took hold as many demanded an explanation.
Twitter users couldn't believe it when they heard Byron McDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sara Parady wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald. This is the first time I've ever seen #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound racist. #contrary.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize that the comment about the swimming result was broadcast live".
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologized to the more than 90 people who responded to the comment on Twitter.
MacDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then posted an apology to the more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel was also quick to issue an apology and statement.
We deeply regret that these comments were made and broadcast live.
Yesterday, we responded immediately and apologized to all our live viewers and followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally.
But in any case, it was unprofessional and poorly chosen, and Byron deeply regrets it.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on air and tried to explain that he didn't think his comment would be taken as a personal attack.
In a live broadcast of the CBC Olympics, he said, "I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition".
I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.
Needless to say, I meant no disrespect, and I am truly sorry that it happened.
Primark shoppers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly places her underwear in the middle of the store.
Customers were uncomfortable when the woman began to undress to store her panties in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she tried them on to see if they fit and then took them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to look for clothes in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone and put on four more pairs of pants.
A Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where this woman folded her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
Jennie Davidson, a mother of two, said that the stranger put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She explains that the people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took off her underwear, took off her socks and pants, and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just put them there.
Everybody watched her take her pants off, and she obviously didn't like it, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She tried on three more pairs before deciding that she didn't like any of them and left the store.
She didn't seem to care that anyone was watching or even thinking about the person who was going to buy the clothes she was wearing.
Mrs. Davidson, 33, from Kent, says: "I can't imagine anyone buying clothes that someone else has put on and hasn't washed".
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds: "I assume that after she left the store, the staff removed the clothes from the shelves - which is also acceptable".
I can't imagine buying a new pair of underwear and finding out that another woman has tried them on and then not washed them.
A Primark spokesperson indicated that Primark was aware of the incident which occurred on Tuesday 9 August.
The clothes in question have been removed from the store shelves.
How to Protect Yourself From Guns by Using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer.
To learn how to defend yourself at close range against gunmen, we spoke with New York City Krav Maga grandmaster Ron Mizrachi.
Whether you are being attacked from the front or from the rear, this video teaches you how to defend yourself and win.
Mizraki points out that if an attacker attacks from behind, one must first turn to get a clear view of the attacker and avoid the bullet's trajectory.
Then the weapon must be grasped between the forearm and the shoulder and the free elbow must strike the opponent in the face.
Then, while the attacker is still in pain, you must take his weapon, strike him in the face with the butt of your weapon, and step away while still pointing it at him.
Similarly, if an attacker approaches from the front, you must avoid the path of the bullet, grab the weapon, and lock it so that the attacker cannot fire.
Simultaneously apply pressure to the weapon and strike the opponent in the chest and finally take the weapon away from him and step back to continue aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how the Mizrachi do just that.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give the robber your money.
A family of vandals demolish the Saltash Cornwall council estate and are evicted.
A family of vandals have been evicted for terrorising their neighbours, causing £50,000 worth of damage to a council estate.
Tania Sheldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock have been evicted from a property in Cold Cornwall following a number of complaints.
When they were forcibly evicted, shocked housing officials discovered that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, garbage everywhere, and graffiti on the walls.
The family has now been evicted and is believed to be living on private property.
Donna McEvoy, manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says that there are fears that it will be impossible to rebuild.
She says that the people who lived here had a very hard time, and she doesn't think people can live like that.
Several factors have to be considered in this case, as the property will not have a good reputation in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed on the property, and police say their terror manifested itself in violence, running into the streets with baseball bats, intimidating locals, drug use, drug dealing, and loud snapping and banging.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who owned the property, was convicted in June of anti-social behaviour.
Discarded garbage was found in several rooms of the demolished house.
Several floorboards have also been excavated at the house, which may have been used for drug trafficking.
Neighbors say they regularly fought in the street and were constantly calling the police.
They were evicted by Cornwall Housing after being given 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy with the arrangement because their lives had been a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about the other residents".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet - something we are not used to!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighborhood protection for the Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family was not cooperating with local law enforcement.
The family had lived here for 20 years, and the police were regularly called.
Various old and unused items were found in the garden of the house.
He also said: "It is a great pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, as eviction is always the last step considered by Cornwall Housing".
This was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme, and it was very hard for the neighbors to watch.
I appreciate the work of my entire team on this case, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the public who have been brave and cooperative in providing us with the information we need.
I hope this event will make life easier for our neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived here at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying out.
Office workers will now have to clean up a pile of trash left in the house.
In 2014, police raided his home and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, accessories and £1,700 in cash.
All Skeldone was found guilty of was possession of Class B drugs with intent to distribute.
She insisted that the money was intended as a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the exhibition, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plymouth.
Many of the walls were covered with graffiti.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their leases.
Devon and Cornwall Police spokeswoman Angela Crowe says the display is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who think they can act as they please and get away with it".
Devon and Cornwall Police will not tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
A willingness to spend can boost an economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkinis on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort city of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkinis on the city's beaches, local officials announced Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linard, has signed a decree that "access to the beaches and bathing is forbidden to anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"Beach attire revealing religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may create a risk of disturbances of public order (riots, clashes, etc.) that must be prevented", states the decree.
"We're not talking about banning religious symbols on the beach. We're talking about outerwear that symbolizes allegiance to terrorist movements that are at war with us", explained municipal utility director Terry Miguel.
He added that burkinis have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since the decree was signed into law by Linard, a member of the centre-right Republicans party, on July 28.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille canceled a planned private event for Muslim women to wear burkinis in swimsuits, following outrage from politicians on both the right and the left.
In France, it is illegal for Muslim women to wear face-covering veils, but not for religious symbols or clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack claimed by the Islamic State in Nice, a resort town near Cannes.
On July 26, two assailants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State brutally murdered priests in a church in northwestern France.
Jysk buys 5% of the grower's turnover
Retailer of household goods SIA 'Jysk Linnen'n Furniture' ('Jysk') is acquiring 5% of the turnover of the grower, reaching EUR 23,66 million, according to information from Firma.lv.
The company's turnover in 2014 was EUR 22,57 million.
The company's profit also increased slightly, from EUR 781 235 in 2014 to EUR 785 896 last year.
The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing shop in Slokas Street in Riga and closed the shop on Kurzemes Prospect in Riga.
This year, as in previous years, the company's main objective is to continue to increase both turnover and profits.
In the meantime, it is advisable not to distribute profits from the previous year.
Jysk is an international chain of home improvement stores.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture was established in 2001.
The share capital of the company is EUR 3 500 264.
The company is owned by Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC, a company registered in Iceland.
The tenderloin is simply grilled on white bread.
Eat them as soon as they're done, that's when they're best.
Grind the fish fillet and the white bread together in a meat grinder.
Add milk, salt, and pepper to the mixture and mix well again.
Then butter, which has been kept at room temperature, is added to the dough and mixed thoroughly to form medium-sized patties.
The cutlets are then wrapped in rye bread.
Heat the oil in a pan.
The cutlets are placed in a pan and cooked until golden brown on both sides for 10 to 15 minutes before eating.
Serve while still warm, drizzled with melted butter or sauce.
The Kuban Festival has begun in Lucusla.
On the evening of Thursday 11 August, one of the last festivals of the summer kicked off in Luqavala.
On the first night, bands such as Enter Shikari from the UK, which was expected last year but suddenly disappeared from the program, American punk band NOFX, DJ Maxim from The Prodigy and others.
Also in the next days of the festival program there are noteworthy names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", punk rock legend "Ramones" drummer Marky Ramone with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto & Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergei Mihalok, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full program of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year that the Kubana Festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but this did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added a full stop to the name, included a Latvian group in the program (Friday evening 19:15 on the stage "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and has acquired a local color along with such symbols of Riga as its panorama and cats".
It is too early to tell whether these efforts will pay off, for the festival is just getting started, but as Delphi Entertainment observed on the first night, it has so far failed to attract huge crowds.
The British track cycling team set two Olympic records and won the sprint race.
Britain's track team broke two Olympic records on Thursday, winning the men's sprint.
The first Olympic record was broken by the British in qualifying, but it was broken again by the New Zealanders in the first round.
In the sprint final, Great Britain faced New Zealand, and the British stripped the New Zealanders of their Olympic record, leaving them with silver medals.
In the final, the British team won with a time of 42.440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the bronze medal match, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also broken in the women's downhill qualifying, with the British team setting a new world record of 4:13.260.
President who stayed in the shadows: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, it will be 145 years since the birth of the second president of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the Latvian state, but remained undeserved in the shadow of the widely described first president of Latvia, Jānis Čakstes, and the last president of the pre-war period, Karlis Ulmanis.
In a book published ten years ago in memory of Gustav Zemgals, Arnold Auziņš writes: "No other citizen of our country has defended democracy and the rule of law as strongly as Zemgals".
In an interview with the Delfi portal, Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
The others are so stiff, always so correct.
He taught us not to be like that, which today would be like Raymond Vignon.
"He was a man of the people", says Auziņš.
Modern politicians are ignorant of history, they refer to Karl Ullmann as a good leader, but few know how bad he was.
The only person he didn't yell at in board meetings was General Balodi.
Even though he's kind and smiling in his pictures, he was hysterical by nature.
"The donkey, with its sense of humor and democracy, gives the opposite impression", says Austen.
Professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, Aivars Stranga, in an interview with Delfi, agrees with Auzyna's assessment of Zemgal as a calm and balanced statesman.
He also notes that Zemgal stood out for his respect for minorities, regularly inviting Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"This was not a common practice at the time", says the historian.
He was a quiet, level-headed man who took a long time to be persuaded to run for president.
He didn't ask for it, he just didn't want the glory.
He was also quite critical of himself because he didn't speak French, but he thought the president should.
'It was during the presidency that I learned the basics of French,' explains Stranga.
Zemgals refused to be persuaded to run again.
In any case, he is a very respected person in the history of Latvia, even before arriving at the presidential palace, he had a serious position - he was a very popular notary.
Zemgals also managed the famous Zemgal cash desk on Suvorova Street 3, where the society of inkers and pawnbrokers was located, in which the Latvian state became practically in the government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He wasn't a big fan of Ulmanis, but he didn't object to him in public.
"In private conversations, it has sometimes been said that Ulmanis' activities are not really sympathetic to him", says Stranga.
Lived a quiet life, no suspicion of wrongdoing or corruption.
How is Zemgale remembered today?
Unfortunately, most people associate him with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were centrist.
"There were no major upheavals during his presidency, so he could be associated with a really stable presidency", concludes Strang.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a Latvian state visit to Sweden, which at that time indirectly meant for Latvia full recognition in the neighboring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals made a state visit to Stockholm.
King Gustav V of Sweden paid a return visit to Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child deal with tantrums
I have often seen parents view a child's outbursts of anger as wrong and abnormal.
When a child expresses his anger openly, we don't know how to react, says psychologist Ekaterina Kess.
He suggests that we talk a little about those natural human emotions - anger and resentment - that we all experience from time to time.
Aggression is physical action directed against another person, usually when we are angry.
When we adults get angry, upset, we usually know what's happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, repress, suppress, bottle up, tell our friends or other loved ones, kick the sofa, smoke a cigarette (not the best way to let off steam!), take a shower, pound the table, or do other things that we normally would not do.
We don't take our aggression out on others because we have all these other ways of dealing with these emotions.
When kids get angry, they don't know what's happening to them, what to call it, or how to deal with it.
They may say things like, "Go away!" "You're an idiot!" "You're a bad mother!" "I hate you!" "I'm not going to hang out with you!"
Children are literally alive, they're fully present in the here and now, they're spontaneous and genuine in their expression, and they're often in the throes of a range of emotions.
It is vital that parents not stifle, shame, or discourage their children from expressing their emotions, including anger.
Does a relationship need a break?
A long day at work, a bad day at the office, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you might want to shut out the world for a while, a day, or longer.
Can we just take a moment to acknowledge the relationship and just take a breath?
Or does it indicate that each partner is headed in a different direction?
The opinions expressed are those of men of various ages.
John, 23, puts it succinctly: "I think if a relationship needs a break, you're not with the right person".
Meanwhile, 30-year-old Edward has discovered a pattern that may help some.
If you feel that your mate is beginning to get on your nerves over every little thing, it may be time to explore other avenues to see if you miss him or her, if you are not thinking about him or her very much, or if you simply do not want to see him or her again.
So the answer is yes, taking a break can help you save time and realize how important your partner is to you.
Kaspar (29) reveals his theory.
I think in a relationship, you have to take breaks from each other every day, because when you're with someone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, arguments are inevitable.
They are caused by noticing every little thing the other person does, and it starts to get on your nerves.
People get bored with each other, especially when there's nothing left to talk about except what you did during the day.
My personal experience would suggest so, which is why I've never been in a relationship that lasted more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else is better, then why does this woman you're with deserve someone who can think that here is not good enough and beyond the mountains are paradise fields?
Thinking is a small betrayal.
If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"I have it, so I'm a little judgmental of those who don't", says Edmund, 46.
Carl, 33, has the opposite view.
I think we all need a moment to breathe.
You can't spend every moment, all the time, from morning till night, looking into each other's eyes and celebrating undying love.
Get away from me!
There's so much to do. Friends, work, parties.
There's a time for everything.
Of course, for a girlfriend or a wife, too, but if the two of them can maintain that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live right up to the grave.
That's the only way.
"It's hard to say whether you should or shouldn't take a break", says 27-year-old Mark.
When that question is asked, they expect that the near future will bring changes - for better or for worse, depending on them.
I mean, when you're young and crazy, you need a break all the time, but when things get serious and the relationship goes to a whole other level, you can't have a break.
You're deciding to spend the rest of your lives together!
"If you can't stand each other's company now and need a break once in a while", explains 19-year-old Christopher, "what will you do when you're retired and have to comment on the noise of passing cats or argue about the best time of day to mow the lawn?"
All names have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and exciting personality, Rosenthal was the first to arouse interest in the fine arts in the Latvian nation.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable", Roman Suta once wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Jani Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when opening a large retrospective exhibition of the old master in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rosenthal is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was inaugurated on 12 August and is open to the public from 13 August until 30 October.
With an extensive retrospective in the newly opened Large Exhibition Hall, the Latvian National Museum of Art honors the painter Jani Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftieth birthday is included in the UNESCO calendar of international celebrations.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Jan Rozenthal Jubilee Year programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classical creative activity, stylistic changes and diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallen-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Museum of Liepāja, the Museum of Tukums and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The atmosphere of the century-old alley is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the titles of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter himself with his camera for the new work.
On the other hand, the Finnish-Latvian Cooperation Society "Rosentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classicist, at the Latvian National Museum of Art at the same time offers the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "Looking at Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition, with content in English, Finnish and Swedish, will open in the autumn at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki.
Matt LeBlanc is looking forward to returning to Top Gear.
Matt LeBlanc, presenter of the TV show TopGear, says he is looking forward to the return of the car show for a second season, but admits that he does not know what the future holds for him.
There's nothing official going on.
"If there is, the BBC will announce it", LeBlanc revealed in a discussion with television critics.
Doubts about the future of Gas Up the Floor arose in July when LeBlanc's partner Chris Evans announced he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and Upstairs Downstairs were "made for each other".
Evans describes the former "Friends" star as a "real and decent man", dispelling rumors that their friendship fell apart during filming.
When Leblanc was asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries like South Africa, Morocco, and Ireland.
According to the BBC, there are no immediate plans to replace Evans in the show's new 24th season.
Meldonium could be removed from the list of banned substances this year.
It is expected that the meldonium contained in the Latvian drug Mildronate could be excluded from the list of substances prohibited for athletes this year, academician Ivars Kalviņš, director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, said in the LNT program 900 seconds on Friday morning.
He said he would go to Canada in September to discuss meldonium with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronate would be removed from the blacklist this year.
Two cyclists taken to hospital after collision in Sigulda.
Two cyclists have collided on Swiss Street in Sigulda, injuring one another, according to the National Police.

It's going to rain and cool off in some places.
Also on Friday, temporary rains are expected in some places in Latvia and it will become even colder, LETA learned from the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Center.
There may be some thunderstorms.
According to forecasts, rainfall is expected mainly in Kurzeme and northern Vidzeme.
The maximum temperature will only be between 16 and 19 degrees.
In Riga, the day will pass without rain and mostly sunny.
However, the temperature will not exceed 60 degrees Fahrenheit [18°C].
In his interpretation, the backstage of the American modeling business took on the perversely elaborate glamour of a photo shoot and the unbearability of a horror film.
Basically, a very provocative work, balancing sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the boundaries between European art house films and the territory of Hollywood genre products.
The film, starring Viggo Mortensen, emphasizes the question of whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativism and distancing themselves from the stupidity and values of consumer society) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.
After the death of his wife, an idealistic father of six is confronted with questions about choices and values.

Of course, the shark only does this as an attack on beautiful women -- in Jaws, it was a swimmer, in this case, an intrepid surfer, played by Blake Lively.
The job demanded her utmost heroism.
This survival solo can be compared to James Franco's performance in 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds' performance in Buried Alive.
Another possible culprit is lead actress Mila Kunis, whose transformation from role model to creative breadwinner and mocker of family values seems to be the product of desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Fighters of the Islamic State terrorist group have taken some 2,000 civilians hostage and are using them as human shields as they flee Manbij, in Syria's Aleppo province, a US-backed Kurdish and Arab alliance and monitors said Friday.
'We did not shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jarabulus,' said a spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council in Manbij.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Manbij had been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State took control of Manbij in 2014.
The SDF drove most of the ISIL fighters out of Manbij last week, but some remained and put up fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking their prisoners with them.
The Islamists are going to Jarabulus, on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that some 2,000 people had been abducted by IS.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the Islamists had hijacked cars, forced people into them, and then drove them to Jarabulus.
Islamic State militants have also carried out mass abductions in the past.
In January, ISIL kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the eastern Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor.
Some 270 of the captives were later freed by the Muslims.
It is not known how many ISIS fighters have fled Manbij.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council in Manbij reported that the SDF managed to rescue 2,500 people held hostage by Islamists in Manbij.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children in Ituri from 2002 to 2003.
He was also known for his repressive methods against the civilian population in Syria.
Kolegava withdraws her candidacy for the post of Head of the SBU.
The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the controversy between the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate have to do with the visible, but more often invisible, interests of politicians and have nothing to do with my professional capacity.
"This is also unacceptable to me", stresses the former contender for the post of head of the Interior Ministry.
In the event that her candidacy were to be confirmed by the Government, it was clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow her to work fully and implement the necessary changes in the Ministry of Education and Research with the support of the entire Government.
Without it, Kolegova concludes, good work would not be possible.
'I have repeatedly stressed publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my whole candidacy process is too politicised,' the official explains.
"Thank you for your trust and support, it is an experience that I value as an advantage", Kolegova writes in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
On Wednesday, Unity stated that during the meeting with Kolegov, "significant contradictions" were revealed between the candidate's explanations and the information available in public registers about the dividend costs of SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs participants' meetings provide for non-distribution of profits.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Pelēkā is the head of the NIS.
In Livno, police are involved in the rescue of two young children left unsupervised, the Latgale Regional Police Department reports.
A report of an unattended stroller came in Friday around 7:00 a.m.
They were found near a former store in Livno.
The two little girls were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment.
A briefcase with documents and a cell phone were also left in the carts.
Within half an hour, law-enforcement officials located the parents.
Upon arriving at the woman's home, the police discovered that she had been drinking heavily and was asleep.
According to preliminary information, on the evening of the previous day, the woman, born in 1992, had visited a friend's house where she had consumed alcohol.
On the way home from a family meal, the woman unexpectedly decides to leave her children at the store.
The police immediately informed the orphanage court, which will also decide on the children's fate.
Riga Freeport has implemented all the recommendations of the UK in relation to the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (SAO) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure development on the island of Krievu for the transfer of port activities from the city center, the company informed the portal Diena.lv.
Approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the UK's view, the Riga Freeport Authority also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit of the Riga Freeport Authority carried out by the international auditor Deloitte and the recommendations provided for improving the project management in the next phase of the project when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations was also sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the administration of the Freeport of Riga does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the usefulness of implementing the Krievu Island project, we take a very responsible attitude towards the implementation of the project and the European Commission (EC), the provider of funding.
I would like to emphasise that all the works planned under the project have been fully completed on time and to the planned extent.
'In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the project, including the EC, the UK and also the stevedores, that the ultimate goal of freedom is the successful implementation of the project, we have fully implemented all the UK recommendations on project management and supervision issues,' says Crimean project manager Sanita Kaire.
In order to control and monitor the achievement of the project's objective, the existing long-term action plan was supplemented by the main planned activities of the parties involved and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of the meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring tools for the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important milestones.
The approved action plan for achieving the objective of the project by 31 December 2018, as recommended by the UK, has been complemented by implementation monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the timing control of the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the City of Riga.
In order to improve project management and mitigate potential risks, the project management plan has been redesigned, defining the project management areas and indicating the documents developed to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure chart reflecting the structure, staff qualifications and functions of the planned project management team has been developed.
In order to improve communication between the Riga Freeport Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan for the project stakeholders has been developed which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange between the stakeholders for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the necessity and legality of concluding a service contract or launching a procurement will have to be justified in greater detail in the future.
As part of the project, a world-class port infrastructure has been built on the Crimean peninsula: four new deep-water berths, railway piers and engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund were completed and put into operation at the end of last year, saving EUR 10.6 million of the funding allocated to them.
Security at Slovakia's airports has been stepped up because of the threats.
Following unspecified threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Interior Ministry announced.
"In view of the threats, we have reinforced security measures at the international airports of Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
'The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received,' he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will be held in the Slovakian capital on 16 September, bringing together all the bloc's countries except Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK's Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia holds the Presidency of the EU until January.
German researchers debate the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall".
A new study suggests that the death toll on the borders of the former Communist East Germany may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts remain.
According to figures released Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum at Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, Communist authorities murdered 1,841 people who tried to escape from areas under their control at the border between the Allied zone and what later became West Germany.
The museum has been tracking border-related deaths for years and periodically revises the death toll.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including that of a six-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to reach West Germany through what was then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are Soviet army deserters.
"The full extent of the damage caused by the twin evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented", admits museum director Alexandra Hildebrandt.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from the Communist-controlled country are collected and preserved", Hildebrandt said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is not convincing", claims Johannes Statz, an expert on East German history at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
Researchers previously estimated that at the Berlin Wall alone, 138 people were murdered by the Communists.
Taking into account the number of people who died trying to flee across the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the State estimates that the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is still significantly lower than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different numbers of casualties could be the different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie museum also lists all suicides by East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If seniors in their 70's and 80's die of heart attacks after collapsing at the border", it must be the result of this "killer frontier", says Hildebrante.
However, the State believes that a distinction must be made between elderly people who may have died as a result of the abuse they suffered and those whose deaths were caused by long waits in hot weather on a bus at the border.
Regardless, counting the victims is not easy because the East German Communist authorities did not keep such statistics and researchers have to dig through scattered archives, according to the State.
However, the State group has recently published new documents and may soon release new casualty estimates.
LPF president Pone went to Rio with a coaching accreditation; it's a surprise to him.
The president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone, who has gained notoriety in recent days, arrived at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with a coaching accreditation, but he feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, German Jakubowski, the coach of Olympic swimmer Alyona Rybakova, caused quite a stir when he revealed that he had decided to go to Rio de Janeiro at the last minute, while the coach had to stay home.
Initially, swimmers Alona Rybakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovski and Dave Collins, as well as federation president Pone were confirmed on the list of riders.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for five participants for the Olympic Games, and before leaving, Aldon Vrublevski claimed that Germans would be there and tickets were being sought for him.
"But obviously for objective reasons he didn't come", Pone said, suggesting that this didn't affect Rybakova's result.
At the federation's request, her coach agreed to help her.
Mr. Pone, himself a member of the IOC Executive Board, sharply criticized the IOC's actions, blaming it on the organization that oversees Olympic sports.
In my view, it is unethical to confirm five people to the IOC Executive Board and not bring one of them.
'I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't get enough seats,' Pone said, pointing out that the work of the federations and their presidents is not appreciated by society, recalling that the federation presidents do not receive a salary.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, pointing out that before the London Olympics, when Rybakova was not confirmed among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.
However, he could not explain why he was at the Olympics with a trainer's accreditation, which must have belonged to Jakubovsky.
"I applied to be team leader, but for some reason I got the coaching badge and now I'm not getting in anywhere".
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I thought it would be the Germans, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a few days before Rybakova's start, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and after that the swimmer had tears in her eyes, but the LPF president himself said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to cheer up the athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF oversees five sports on the Olympic programme, four of which are also being trained in Latvia.
The president of the federation said that demolition issues were also very important in Latvia and that he had spoken about such programs during his almost two-week stay in Rio de Janeiro.
He praised the work of the federation and said that the World Cup stage could be held in Latvia in 2018.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, it's where I work and spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.
600,000 baby salmon will be released into the river.
During the AS Latvenergo fish stock recovery programme, salmon and sea trout hatchlings are being released this week in the Daugava at Mangaļsala, and this year more than 600 000 one-year-old salmon and sea trout hatchlings from the Bior Tomes and Dole fish farms of the scientific institute are planned to be released.
LETA informed the Latvian Energy Agency that the release of fish will continue in the coming months, with a total of 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species being released into the Danube basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, common and Norway lobster shall be released, in June, sprat, in July, salmon, in August and September, zander and whiting.
Māris Kuņickis, Production Director of Latvenergo, said that concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the group's sustainable development.
'Every activity in the protection and reproduction of fish resources is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the Bior scientific institute, both by breeding and releasing juvenile fish in the Daugava basin and by implementing other activities,' said Kunickis.
This year, more than 600 000 yearling salmon and sea trout will be released into the Danube estuary.
From the second year onwards, the fry are marked by cutting the fathead minnow before release.
Today's shipment includes 25,000 baby salmon weighing an average of 31.3 grams.
The introduction of juveniles and larvae into the Danube and its basin water bodies shall be carried out annually on the basis of scientifically sound species composition and numbers.
The restoration of fish stocks in the Danube River and its basin shall be carried out by the Bior in accordance with the legislation, based on an expert assessment of the damage caused to fish stocks as a result of Latvenergo's economic activities and providing a conclusion on the compensatory measures to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish stocks.
The State Environmental Service, in turn, decides on the amount and form of compensation on the basis of this expert report.
Latvenergo's annual compensation for the fish stock recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the 'Mēs zivīm' association, will install 400 artificial fish spawning nests in the Daugava near Kaibalas and Ikšilas for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the association in promoting natural spawning of fish is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo in the framework of the fish stock recovery programme.
The construction of artificial nests in the reservoir is an important measure contributing to the conservation and reproduction of fish resources in the Danube.
The Sanssouci Concert Hall has a courtyard, a forest and a sawmill.
Sleeping in a tent, eating like in a restaurant, walking in chains and listening to investigative chamber music while enjoying the quiet peace of nature - this is the combination offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sanssouci.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former manor house of Suse - a village that no longer exists - and in the nearby woods and sawmills.
For three days, from August 12 to 14, five stages combine the carefree pleasures of nature with the refinement of classical music.
Here, music meets theatre and contemporary circus, performance and installation.
Opera and academic music, especially in their more recent forms, find new audiences in a free and open environment without the rigidity of concert halls.
Riga is about 90 miles [150 km] away, but a smile and a lighthearted walk are just minutes away.
"Please do not look for a program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sanssouci can only be captured by spending all three days there", invites the initiator and host of the festival, operatic baritone Armands Siliņš.
The festival opens on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there'll be software on site with all the information.
For those who have to choose a day, we recommend Saturday, since it is the busiest, from 9:00 a.m. until dawn the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Siliņš.
The splendid group of artists includes, for example, violinist Eva Binder, cellist Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, the Quadra and RIX quartets and even the Estonian aerial acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erik Kirchfeld, Martins Zilberts and actress Anca Strazdas created the contemporary circus show Confines about the artist's inner struggle.
New works have also been created especially for the festival.
In the children's play "Insect", composed by Olesja Kozlovska and Jakob Niemannis based on the story by F. Kafka, the entomologist (insect researcher) Uģis Piterāns will participate along with Armandas Siliņš, musicians and actors.
Oskar Herliņš has composed the first String Quartet, while Anna Kirse has written The Opera of Trees, a performance whose main characters, directed by Andras Kalnozol with video projections by Katrin Neiburg and set design by Andras Eglish, will be trees in three small puddles in a three-hectare lime grove.
Singing in the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dinara Rudāne and Sigmar Graš, they will fall into romantic relationships, just like the Enlightenment Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus in his study The Wedding of Trees (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will be opened today by Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will compete in the 100 metres hurdles at 15:35 Latvian time and in the high jump at 16:50.
At 2:35 a.m. on Saturday, the shot put competition will begin, followed by the 200-meter dash at 4:05 a.m.
The heptathlon will conclude on Saturday with the long jump, javelin throw, and the 800-meter run.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won bronze at the World Championships last year, was mentioned as a contender for the Olympic Games medal.
Back in May, the Latvian set a new national record (6,622 points) and took second place in the prestigious heptathlon in the Austrian city of Götz.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when she won ninth place with a repeated Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, she has broken the national record four times.
Today at 4 p.m. the start is also scheduled for the Latvian judo fighter Artur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first round he will fight with the Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri.
For Judith, these will be the first Olympic Games of her career.
The LETA news agency reported that Latvian judoka Yevgeny Borodavko lost his first fight in the under-100 kg weight class on Thursday.
He lost to Japan's Hagu Ryunosuke, who went on to win bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zeloni brought Latvia the Olympic bronze medal, but in the next four Olympic Games, Latvian judokas won only one victory in seven fights, which was won by Borodavko in London.
At 16.30 Latvian time, Dainis Upelnieks will start the qualification competition in the shot put, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The swimmer only received his Olympic swimming badge the day the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but he later revealed to LETA that he had been quite confident about swimming since April.
The athlete arrived at the Olympic venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the shooting competition.
Plkst.19.05 after Latvian time the final three trips will be made by the Olympic debutant 17-year-old Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes in sailing in the RS: X class.
After three days or nine trips, Birzule is currently 25th in the overall ranking among 26 athletes.
And on Saturday, the final medal round will be decided.
Today's final event will be the academic rowing competition, in which Ireland's Latvian representative, Sanita Pušpure, will compete.
Wednesday's race was canceled due to inclement weather.
Pushpure will compete in the women's singles C/D semifinals at 7:10 p.m. for the 13th spot in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, in the quarter-final round, she finished fourth, from third position, which would allow her to continue the fight for the medal, trailing by 0.65 seconds.
Pushpure finished 13th four years ago in London, also representing Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be awarded in archery, athletics, track cycling, horseback riding, shooting, ski jumping, judo, rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis, and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will nominate Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president will choose a replacement for current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
During his press conference on Thursday, Reid said he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
A spokesman for Reid later stated that he had not personally discussed the matter with Clinton and that it was pure speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to rock the boat with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "puppets" and acting in the interests of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump is unfit to be president.
Treats announces a nude calendar for women and men.
Treat magazine will collaborate with photographer David Bellemare to create a 2017 Pirelli calendar in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 calendar, NU Muse plans to showcase emerging supermodels rather than naked celebrities.
Earlier this year Steve Shaw, president of Treat magazine, declared that his erotic art magazine differs from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about the calendar, too.
In a press release about the making of the calendar, Shaw states: "We need to return to the timeless and classic images of nudity, where the female body is not seductive but inspiring to both women and men".
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a great work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person at casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
In the case of a rebate, the buyer takes the motorcycle out for a test drive.
A Yamaha YZ250 unregistered motorcycle was stolen from a house in Rembate on 10 August at 10 a.m., reports the National Police.
The owner of the motorcycle had tried to sell it by means of an advertisement.
At the appointed time, the prospective buyer arrived, got on his motorcycle as if to imitate it, and left.
The officers of the Ogre Police Station of the Riga Regional State Police are asking anyone who can provide any information useful to the investigation in connection with the crime to call.
Please call: 65002403 (during office hours) or 65002400 (all day).

The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest shark on record was a 17-foot-long [5 m] female that may have lived from 272 to 512 years.
A French court has rejected a request to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A French court has rejected a claim by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-built shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, home to several thousand refugees.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, the authorities said the state should demolish 72 home-grown shops where people in the camp sell things like cigarettes and energy drinks, haircuts, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in home-grown restaurants.
The prefect's office in Calais stated that these self-established businesses had to be dismantled because they formed a shadow economy and did not pay taxes, and posed fire and health risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of inhabitants continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-help stores and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Court of Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the eviction of people who had set up 72 self-built shops, but it understood the concerns of the Prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-François Mollet said that food, cafes, and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in "extremely poor conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at risk of demolition is the camp's Jungle Book Kids café, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and shelter advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some as young as eight".
On Friday, two charities, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to 9,000, the highest figure since the summer surge.
Great Britain wins silver in the rugby sevens as Fiji's national team masterfully takes the gold.
Great Britain's impressive run in the rugby sevens series came to an end on Thursday when they were thrashed 43-7 by Fiji in a thrilling final at Deodoro Stadium in Rio.
Fiji demonstrated mastery in ball handling, footwork, support play, and brute force, winning gold, its first Olympic medal.
The defeat brought a respectable consolation prize of a silver medal, which was Britain's third medal of the day.
A tough fight in the semi-finals, where the Boxing team suffered a defeat with a score of 7: 5 in the first half of the day, may have reflected on Great Britain in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji team is currently in their best form to win even the 15-man squad.
It may come as little comfort to Britain that at least one Briton won the gold medal - Fiji's Ben Ryan, former coach of England at Wimbledon.
For Britain, it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in a rugby sevens series in Adelaide.
They only lost one game this time.
Defeat is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji began the match with a spectacular display of British strength.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it was like running into several oncoming buses, and the World Series champions took a 5-0 lead when Hosea Collins scored the first touchdown.
In the final four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also extended the lead with a touchdown on the right wing.
The score was 12 to nothing, and the British team had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant power play prevented the typical Leonie Nakarawa from scoring three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jas Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, extending the lead over Great Britain to 17-0.
After the break, Nakarava extended his lead to more than a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British force tactics and crossed the line to score.
The touchdown made it 29 to nothing.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play rugby sevens while the British were still learning.
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The British team made a dramatic turnaround at half-time, breaking the Fijian line... for a full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team effort, scored a few more points for Fiji.
Dan Norton scored the winning points for the British team with a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was already lost as the South Sea Islanders sang, waved flags, and danced in the stands.
One cannot help but admire the happy-go-lucky attitude of the Fijians.
Matt William made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another late touchdown.
When the final whistle blew, Fiji could celebrate, but the British sat on the grass in defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams won on the ground and the South Africans lost by only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown took the lead for the Boks, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill and drove the ball between the posts, securing the British victory.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony, a member of England's under-15 rugby team, won another silver medal with a fine display of strength at the end of the game.
Coach's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the air race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and that's saying a lot.
From the first to the last corner, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had a special meaning on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although only two athletes are on board, they were accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, who inspired them to win their second Olympic gold medal in women's pair rowing, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such a feat.
They certainly dominated, because for the 39th time, they won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes gliding gracefully on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a team that works hard to continually improve their performance, and the greatest contributor to their success is a coach who only 30 months ago did not know if he would live to see this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the cancers that you can operate on, and it did.
If you don't, it'll spread throughout your body.
And the situation would get out of control.
It changes your perspective a little bit.
William was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio succeeded in allowing Williams to begin the recovery process at the start of the 2014 off-season and reduce the length of the break to a minimum, so to speak.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I walked distances of 20, 30, and even 50 feet, even though the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it all started.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even greater.
After the win, my first thought was of Williams, who had been very nervous all morning and was talking more than usual.
Staning, who served with the Royal Artillery in Afghanistan, said: "It's been an emotional week, but it means a lot to me".
It just confirms how much this means to us and how hard Helen, Robin and I have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be where we are today, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of better sparring partners or better coaches.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The pair reach speeds unmatched by their competitors.
Even in the final 500 meters, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to close in, Stanning and Glover's lead was too great.
We felt every moment of it.
Helen shouted, "Keep the beat, keep the beat".
It's really important to stay focused.
We got off to a good start, but at the same time we didn't have high hopes.
Our goal that day was not to break records, but simply to row well and win races, and that is what we did.
Take a couple of years off, figure out what to do next.
Next month is the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very nervous.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "It feels fantastic".

Celebrating the 90th birthday of the Los Angeles Public Library with what else? A new book!
He has been awarded with the order "For loyalty to duty" by the "authorities".
According to him, it is now "fundamentally important" for Prime Minister Mari Kuczynski (Green and Farmers' Union) and Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union) to confirm the candidates nominated by the Minister of Finance for the position of the head of the VID.
Rajewski estimates that for both Kuczynski and Reizniece-Ozola in this government, the confirmation of the head of VID is the "first big decision" that can affect their future as politicians.
If they start to change their stance on the choice of candidate for the position of the head of the Interior Ministry, it will negatively affect their image in the public administration.
The agenda of the Cabinet meeting next week includes the issue of the transfer of the head of the VVD, Kolegova, to the post of Director General of the VID, according to the government's agenda.
He was nominated by the Minister of Finance, Ms Reizniece-Ozola, following the resignation of Ms Ināra Pētersone and the unsuccessful bid for the post of Director-General of the NSI.
The acting head of the VID, Dace Pelēkā, admitted in an interview with Latvijas Radio on Thursday, August 11, that if she were offered to run for the position of head, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he was not considering other candidates for the position of the Head of the SAI for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, the leader of the parliamentary faction of the National Association, also admitted that the NA still supports Kolegov's leadership of the VID.
In Spain, the prospects for reducing the budget deficit are threatened by the inability to form a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce their budget deficits to the 3% of GDP required by the euro area.
It is estimated that, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit reached 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, compared with 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many EU countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase this negative sentiment.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is inconsistent in its decisions, agreeing common rules at the outset and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example, Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank, has pointed out that Europe is losing its self-confidence by creating the impression that European Union rules are advisory rather than binding.
The Commission has now proposed, and all Member States have agreed, to extend the deadline for the correction of budgetary deficits until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts indicate that the targets set for Portugal could be achieved on time and that the budget deficit could be reduced to 2,5% of GDP already this year.
This means that the government will have to implement austerity measures amounting to 0,25% of GDP this year as part of the stability programme.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention being paid to controlling the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
The budget deficit is to be reduced to 4,6% of GDP this year, 3,1% next year and 2,2% in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0,5% of GDP each year for the following two years.
Achieving these objectives is made particularly difficult by the fact that Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on a government for eight months and by the growing possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that a third election would not significantly change the political landscape in the country.
The most popular party remains the People's Party, led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which would again get less than 33% of the vote.
Only the Socialists have slightly increased their popularity, while the anti-austerity parties Podemos and Ciudadanos have slightly decreased.
The PP wants the Socialists and Ciudadanos to join the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the 2017 draft budget to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to Rafael Hernando, a member of the Popular Party parliamentary group, if a government is not formed and elections are held for a third time, Spain will become the laughingstock of Europe.
The cleanliness of the bathing areas in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After surveying the beaches for the fifth year, activists concluded that unfortunately the number of items found is increasing year by year, and visitors are largely to blame.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
The city council explains that the bathing areas are cleaned every day, but it is very difficult to deal with dirty visitors.
Moreover, waste left on land can be washed into the water during rainfall, thus seriously affecting its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This message was distributed this week by volunteers from the 'My Sea' campaign.
For the fifth year in a row, activists measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga have found that the amount of garbage left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, that criticism has stuck.
"We can see that this will be the year when the amount of garbage on the beach will exceed 200 items per 100 meters", says John Ulme of the My Sea expedition.
When Latvian Radio called him, he was at Tuyja beach, where the march of volunteers along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, among the various household trash and picnic leftovers, activists even picked up the light bulbs left behind by beachcombers.
Ulme, a participant and organizer of the march, blames the pollution on local residents.
"The main source is the beachgoers themselves, as more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, all kinds of waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the process of decomposing, they can no longer be identified, and cigarette butts, bottles, corks", says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches are those in Riga.
In Daugavpils, for example, an average of almost 800 pieces of waste is collected every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
Campaigners also explain that smoking is rampant and that warning or prohibition signs are not posted everywhere.
"The average figures for all three bathing areas in Riga - Daugavpils, Vakarbuļi and Vecāķi - are unfortunately high and far exceed the desired goal, which Latvia seems to be moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", concludes the environmentalist.
The cleaning of swimming pools in Riga is done every day, even twice on the hottest days of summer, explains Uģis Vidauskis, a member of the council.
However, dealing with unclean visitors is not easy.
We come back to the question of the culture of these people.
"Those who gossip, drink, smoke, and do all the other things you're not supposed to do, even the special signs don't work on them", says Vidauskis.
Therefore, Vidauskis urges visitors to the bathing areas to report the pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, you can safely point out these violations, and you can fight back.
Maybe you can put up some new warnings, but as I said, I don't think it's going to change things dramatically.
"Because all of us together simply have to turn around and be intolerant of these offenders", he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, for the fourth time this summer, water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in previous years, the water quality is said to be good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that the water quality at all 56 bathing areas has always been good and there are no bathing restrictions.
"We will take the samples for the last time at the end of August", says Normunds Kadiķis, the inspectorate's senior environmental health officer.
Waste left on land during heavy downpours may be washed into the water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
The rotation of Russia's elite continues with a change of leadership in Putin's administration.
Did he quit on his own?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov had resigned of his own volition and would henceforth be the president's special representative for nature protection, ecology and transport.
When announcing the changes, Putin praised Ivanov in front of television cameras, saying: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working together with you for many years and we are doing it successfully".
I am satisfied with the way you are carrying out your duties.
I recall our agreement not to use you as Chief of Staff for more than four years.
That's why I understand your desire to diversify.
And I hope that you will continue to make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position.
However, it is pointed out that heading the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most powerful people in the country.
Given Russia's upcoming State Duma elections next month, there have been fears that the move is linked to a power struggle within Russia's political elite.
He has been awarded with the order "For loyalty to duty" by the "authorities" of "Republic of Crimea".
According to Lsm.lv's archives, Ivanov is a Colonel General of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Former Head of the Federal Migration Service office for Sevastopol.
He began his intelligence career in 1975, where he met Vladimir Putin.
He has given relevant information including a database to the Russian Intelligence Service (FSB).
In taking on and acting in this capacity, Zakharchenko has supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and further destabilised Ukraine.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the 'Information Security Doctrine' developed by Ivanova was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
He has been awarded with the order "For loyalty to duty" by the "authorities" of "Republic of Crimea".
Now, after stepping down as head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also keep his seat on Russia's National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
The fault lies with the family of the Soviet party elite.
According to Ivanov, Vaino was recommended by Ivanov himself for the position of Head of the Presidential Administration.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other a long time.
Back when we were working for the government under you.
And for the past five years or so, we've communicated almost every day.
"That is why I am convinced that by all his professional and personal qualities he is ready for this job", Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family that was part of the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years as its first secretary until 1988.
The online publication Meduza, referring to the book Estonian Self-Determination and Independence, says that in the late 1980s, Karl Vaino asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Shortly thereafter, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the Presidential Protocol Office.
As has already been reported, Russia has been shaken in recent days by the dismissal and even arrest of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of several regional governors and federal representatives.
According to political analysts, President Vladimir Putin is reshuffling the ruling elite ahead of the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is the increasing presence of representatives of the power structures in leading positions.
Judo fighter Nikiforenko also loses his first fight in the Olympics.
This was a first round match, and the Latvian judo fighter has ended his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian Television that Nikiforenko's hopes were very low, and this was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the judo fighter had injured his shoulder in a fight.
Significantly, to reach the Olympic finish line, Nikiforenko had to compete in a different weight class - under 220 pounds [100 kg].
The Azerbaijani wrestler weighed more than 55 pounds [25 kg].
It has already been reported that in the 100-kilogram weight class, Yevgeny Borodavko held out for two and a half minutes against Ryunosuke before his opponent scored a clean victory.
With that, the Latvian judo competition in Rio is over.
Dreams are lost in the sands of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by judoka Evgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he faced a more titled opponent, but ambition can sometimes surprise.
He didn't.
Arthur Nikiforenko's task was made more difficult by the fact that he was less experienced and faced a formidable opponent.
The result is similar, although he lasted almost a minute and a half longer on the tatami than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately Latvian judokas lack ambition the most.
Since Gunārs Kirson and his financial advisor Vladimir Šestakov left the leadership of the federation, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, there is no longer a "Golden Score" - the development of judo is on a downward trend.
There are no heirs for Jackevich, who advises the Kazakhstani judokas here, and for Vsevold Zelony.
But if it doesn't, it won't.
And that is the Federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as if from another galaxy, the president of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals.
A flight away from reality.
Last night we were anxiously awaiting the beach volleyball match between Samoilov/Šmédiņš and Evandro/Pedro Solberg.
It's like a death match. The losers lose.
The Latvian duo had a slight deviation - they could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
Tensions were heightened by a lengthy preliminary game.
No one wanted to die - a feeling that hung over the windswept court throughout the match.
For the players, a gust of wind presented additional difficulties.
At first it looked like it might be our most versatile ally.
But it didn't.
Playing against the Latvian duo here was quite easy.
Just serve Samoilov and wait for him to crack.
He went down against Canada, he went down against Cuba at the end of the first set and the beginning of the third because the pressure was too much.
Smokey could fish in those days because there wasn't much work, but when there was, he did it well.
Samoilov and Šmēdiņš could have won the Brazilians in two sets, as he took the lead in the first with 16:15, but he also stayed at 16, exhausting the lost points limit.
But we could have lost 0-2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, but thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
He's already down by three on Evander's serve.
A chain was formed - an unconvincingly received serve, the second ball often flew too close to the net and Samoilov was left with very few options for a productive attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov on the field against the Cubans, then he was more successful this time, and it would be unprofessional to blame the loss only on Sasha.
Creel also made a mistake, and it was symbolic that he hit the last ball on the block.
It's a losing team.
In the third set alone, two of Evandro's strikes almost flew off the court, but the ball still hit the line.
There were two aisles next to the line.
The video of the controversial episode also went in favor of the opponents.
If Evandro struggled with his serves in the first two games, they were very productive against us.
It all added up to a loss on the board.
Now we must calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Perhaps he should have lived near the stadium, as many did, instead of with the delegation in the Olympic Village.
The trip took two and a half hours.
Maybe it was the seven semi-final series that gave me a little confidence.
Maybe I shouldn't have played in Klagenfurt, but I should have come here earlier and acclimatized better.
Maybe it was a mistake to find the pinnacle of athleticism.
We're waiting for more questions than answers.
It's game over for us faggots.
The dream of medals is over.
So, what's next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments and the Jurmala Masters.
Smokey and Samoilov have never been friends in their lives and never will be because they have too different personalities.
But you don't have to.
After an Olympic medal is lost, the thought of divorce may come to mind, as the blame is placed not only on oneself but also on one's mate.
It is not difficult to get divorced, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy mate in Latvia.
Both brothers play volleyball, but John and Tom have already tried and also divorced, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toch, return to Martinus Pļaviņš, but it will not be better than this version, which has repeatedly proved itself in the World Cup stages.
The sands of Copacabana didn't smile on them this time.
That's it.
Of course, beach volleyball is growing in popularity, new couples are forming, and only a few are under six feet [2 m] tall.
This does not guarantee success, but it is an important factor in winning.
Ours won't last much longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the venues offered by the Games organisers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players don't stay in the Olympic Village.
Also, some of the beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the modest accommodations offered to journalists were grossly overpriced.
That's why we chose to rent an apartment.
The risk is that sometimes they can be logistically inconvenient.
It's worth the risk this time.
Vladimir Vladimirovich and I rent apartments on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 yards away, the bullring half an hour away.
The neighborhood is relatively safe because of its proximity to the favela, but you must not let your guard down.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately think of, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Looks like another medal dream came true Friday morning.
In the 100-meter hurdles and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa fell short of her personal records.
But there's still five events.
After a 10-year hiatus, "Porgy and Bess" is playing in Latvia.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bess" premiered in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece has never been revived.
That is why the organizers of the Czech Arts Festival and the Art Forum of Liepāja, in close cooperation, have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's masterpiece.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year hiatus, since the last opera performance in July, this concert version of George Gershwin's magnificent opera Porgy and Bess can be enjoyed in our newly opened Grand Amber Concert Hall", says Grand Amber's manager, Babe Boze.
Porgy and Bess is a story of love, its vicissitudes, its passions, as well as the tragedies of domestic life and the simple joys of everyday life.
It reflected African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It's this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is incredibly powerful, incredibly beautiful, and somehow really deep", says director Westur Karisch.
What I love most about listening to or performing this opera is that there are always these stopping points - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another, or choirs, or orchestras.
"It's the most exciting thing, this construction", says Andris Poga, the musical director and conductor of the Porgy and Bess Concert Studio.
Opera-goers agree that it is a grand event.
They are thrilled to hear this world-famous Gershwin opera.
It is a blessing to be able to breathe the air of the world in Liepāja.
"The execution is professional", says Edgar Lamm, a visitor to the opera.
The concert study was special in that the orchestra played in the orchestra pit for the first time in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" and the first opera concert performance took place.
The area near the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Jan Rozenthal.
At the opening of the Rosenthal Jubilee Exhibition, the Deputy Mayor of Riga, Andris Ameriks, announced that the address of the museum itself in the future could not be Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street 10a, but Jaņa Rozentāla laukums 1.
The director of the museum, Māra Lāce, acknowledged that re-registering the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but generally welcomed the idea and therefore agreed with the municipality's proposal.
The city of Riga laid the foundation stone for this idea in 1936 by creating the Burkhardt Zen monument to Jan Rozenthal, which stands next to the museum.
The then director of the museum, Vilhelms Purvītis, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this follow-up could be purely logical.
I feel guilty all the time, but what about Wilhelm the Swampy?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said the Hatter.
It is reported that the National Museum of Art will officially close its doors in May of this year after extensive renovation and modernization.
This week, the reconstruction of the WEF Palace of Culture will finally begin.
The castle will be renovated by SIA Velve at a cost of approximately EUR 11 million.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two auditoriums, and to adapt the building for the disabled.
The Riga City Council has intended to attract six million euros of European Union funds for the project, but the director of the Riga City Council's Property Department, Oleg Burovs, admits that there is still no complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political will to start the renovation of the VEF Palace of Culture by attracting European structural funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money will be granted or not", says Burov.
Last December we were told that everything depended on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission telling them to make their own decision, that Brussels does not make decisions here.
Now we see another round of discussions forming, so let's see what we can expect in the coming days.
'I want to say that the Riga City Council guarantees without a doubt that this process will be started and completed on time,' says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Palace of Culture collectively held a farewell concert before the imminent renovation of the building.
A year later, the building had still not been renovated and the collective continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Palace of Culture is divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the palace.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Cultural Palace and to improve the surrounding area.
It provides for the development of the surrounding area and utilities and the renovation of the building's facade.
The second is the improvement of the range of services offered by the VEF Cultural Palace.
It envisages the restoration of the building's interior, walls and ceilings, the improvement of the stage and sound recording studio, and the arrangement of the building's internal engineering communications.
The third is the improvement of working conditions for creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of Liv, the legendary rock band can be introduced at an exhibition in Liepāja.
The exhibition will feature various objects that characterize "Livas" - photographs that are arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from its beginnings until 2010, when the group's end is announced.
The participants' stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the wider public, reflecting the creative activity of the group "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the collection of the Museum of Liepāja.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
Musicians who were associated with the group "Livy" and their relatives also responded to the invitation and shared objects and memories.
The origins of "Livu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble led by Juris Pavītols was created in the Liepāja House of Culture.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival "Liepaja amber" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavītols met Eric Kīgelis and founded a group in the Metalurgs Palace of Culture, inviting Ingrīda Gūtmane, Andris Krūziņš and Jāni Grodums to join.
Over the years, the band's lineup has changed several times.
Members have joined, some have left, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"With jeans, hair, and a beard, these guys were a far cry from the stereotypical showgirl", says music critic Klaus Wowere of the group.
In addition to the aforementioned musicians, the group has worked with such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Rusiņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Stark, Laimis Racenajs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīz, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Klein and many others.
Admission to the exhibition is free.
The exhibition runs from 19 August to 30 October.
On 27 August, the 40th anniversary celebration of the group "Līvi" will be held at the "Pūt, vējiņi" concert hall in Liepāja.
Inflation in Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed monthly inflation of 1%.
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.

The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
Compared with the previous month, the following groups of consumer goods recorded price increases in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances, household equipment and regular household cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month's level for alcohol and tobacco, utilities, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time comes, and the truth rises.
Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankevich of the Latvian Catholic Church emphasizes in an interview with the newspaper Neatkarīgaja that if we want to gain strength in life, the Gospel message must be at the center of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the fury of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Feast of the Assumption in Aglona.
What message will believers there receive this year?
In recent years the papal nuncio has expressed a desire to conduct the main service in Aglona.
Hence, the content of the central message is also up to him.
It has also become a tradition for Bishop John Bull to lead the Way of the Cross.
He, too, will craft his own message.
I'm conducting the vigil the day before.
Last year, I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si' and updated its theme of our common home, the Earth, in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I'm looking at what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to respond to that in my talk.
My approach is consistent with the church's admonition to put the Gospel message at the center of our lives.
It is to show that the Gospel answers man's most vexing problems and inspires him to move forward.
Then it talks to people.
But in the Cesis, in the Lamp discussion, you said that we need to "return to a sense of the whole person".
What do you mean?
Does this mean that one is turning away from the church's message?
And does the church today have that kind of return resource?
In the capital of India, a dying man was robbed on the side of the road.
A man in India's capital was found dead on the side of the road after lying unconscious for an hour and then being robbed, reports the BBC.
It's been reported that the man, identified as Matt Bull, worked as a rickshaw driver by day and a security guard by night.
At 5:30 a.m., Mabel was walking home when she was struck by a car.
Surveillance footage shows the driver exiting the vehicle to check on the victim and then leaving.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know anything about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a gardener.
Approximately 90 minutes after the collision, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died of his injuries.
By withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, has saved the government from collapse, according to Ojārs Skudra, associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Her explanation for withdrawing her candidacy due to disagreements within the ruling coalition was that she had prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with LETA, Ant said that it was hard for him to imagine "Unity" supporting Kolegava's candidacy at the government meeting next week.
Therefore, if the Solidarity ministers voted against, but Kolegov was confirmed anyway, this would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also considers that before announcing the withdrawal of her candidacy, Ms Kolejowa had consulted both Finance Minister Danuta Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mari Kuczynski.
She also said it was a betrayal of Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
Predicting whether the competition would result in a suitable candidate, Skudra acknowledged that there were two options: either a compromise figure would be chosen, or Dace Pelēka would continue to lead the institution as acting Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far stated that no other candidate is being considered, this is a sign to Pelėkaja that he should not participate in the tender.
LETA has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service Kolegova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the SES.
Due to "Unity's" objections, the government on Tuesday postponed Kolegava's confirmation as Director-General of the National Intelligence Service for a week.
After the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she was still ready to become the head of the SID.
However, she later changed her mind - in a submission to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola on Friday, she states that she withdraws her consent to be transferred to the position of the head of the NIS and that this is not an easy choice for her.
Andrei Vaivar, press secretary of Prime Minister Mara Kucinskaya, explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director General of VID.
There was an accident involving a police car in downtown Riga.
A traffic accident involving a State Police car occurred in downtown Riga this afternoon.
A police car with its lights and sirens on responds to a high-speed chase until it collides with another car at the intersection of Christian Baron and Girnau.
Police are investigating the incident, but initial reports indicate that the second vehicle did not pass the police car.
There was a woman in an accident.
This year, Riga's shrinking population
At the beginning of this year, Riga had 638 784 inhabitants, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Office (CSP) informed LETA.
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population of over one million.
According to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the Latvian capital takes first place among Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women among Europe's larger cities: Vilnius has 123 women for every 100 men, while Tallinn has 121.
Warning pictograms shall be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), Baiba Gailīte, representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, told LETA.
A rapid repair of the damage caused by skateboarding has now been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be added in the coming days.
Residents will be warned that the surface can be slippery in rain and snow and that cars, bicycles, skis, and roller skates should not be used.
Ushakov also wrote about the incident on Facebook, saying that the damage does not pose any security risks, but "looks sloppy" and skateboarders "will have to be chased".
Holidays for children and parents - new children's playgrounds have been installed in Riga.
During this summer season, the municipality of Riga has even installed two new playgrounds in the city, in Kypsalo and Čiekurkalne, which are now available to children.
A large, multifunctional toy boat with various climbing elements, bridges, games, funnels and slides is installed on the beach of Kipsala.
The play area is intended for children of all ages.
Swings and various balancing elements are also installed on the field.
The location of the attraction on the banks of the Danube, with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there, adds to the fantasy world of small boaters.
On the playground between the Čiekurkalna 4 and 5 crossings, there is a playhouse, a trampoline, a stairway, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other play elements, as well as an exercise area with rings strength and coordination training, along with other sports elements.
Under the surface there is a rubber covering in different colours.
A new, colorful tarpaulin has been installed on the street side near the playground.
A reconstructed section of the road was discovered in Medumi.
Transport Minister Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvijas Valsts ceļi (LVC), as well as the builder SIA "Binders" and representatives of municipalities today opened the reconstructed section of the main national highway Russian border (Grebnev) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are the country's calling card, especially border roads, so it is particularly gratifying to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how EU co-financing is improving the situation on the country's main roads.
"According to forecasts, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be exhausted already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested highways in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding", emphasised Uldis Augulis while cutting the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by transport experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
The construction works on the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km) were started by SIA Binder last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT) and the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
'The reconstructed road section has a completely renewed road structure and next year the repair work will start on the next section from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thus the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged', informed the chairman of the LVC board, Jānis Lange.
The country's main highways are the most congested, and by 2018, we plan to have all the country's main highways in good condition.
The next challenge will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring timely periodic maintenance and replacing the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
'Of course, this will require adequate funding, and all travellers are looking forward to the proposals from the expert group on how to organise road funding,' noted Lange.
The project provided road connections and lighting in the centre of Medum.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: extensive desulphurisation in four stages and extensive graveling and paving work, smoothing the hitherto very uneven road profile.
Public transport stops have also been renovated and a new public transport turnaround has been built.
Previously, the road had insufficient capacity and the surrounding terrain was not passable due to mountain valleys, and the old road shared the terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renew the section of the highway from the city border of Daugavpils to the reconstructed section so far (144.80-156.40 km).
LVC plans to carry out various types of works on more than 1100 kilometres of national roads this year.
Information on all repair works planned on the national road network this year is available on LVL's website www.lvceli.lv.
"Choosing the right combination of foods is very important to achieve the desired weight loss results", says Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene, a registered dietitian in Lithuania.
And it's easy to do in the summertime when we have fresh fruit, berries, and vegetables in our gardens.
A balanced combination of foods can help you not only to lose weight but also to stimulate various bodily processes.
Pasta and vinegar are a winning combination because they provide a long-lasting buzz and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and can make us feel more alert.
Cayenne pepper and a protein-rich meal, such as poultry or a protein shake, not only make you feel more at home but also reduce cravings for large meals on subsequent meals.
This combination of foods can increase post-meal calorie burn by up to 35%.
Research suggests that cayenne pepper may help you lose belly fat.
Eggs contain the metabolic nutrient choline, and bell peppers are a good source of vitamin C.
Adequate intake of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels and thus the accumulation of fat around the midsection.
Oatmeal with fresh berries is another tasty, fat-burning breakfast to add to your menu.
Oat bran and berries contain solvents that, according to Canadian researchers, control the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin and thus the feeling of hunger.
Berries also contain polyphenols, which aid weight loss and prevent the buildup of fat.
Vegetables and protein can also do wonders for weight loss.
This combination can create a sense of home.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they add a sense of home.
At the same time, protein slows down the digestive process and makes you feel full for longer.
For lunch, you can have chicken salad or a protein shake with your favorite vegetables.
Which combinations of products to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - either monosaccharides or disaccharides - made up of one or two molecules.
Starch, on the other hand, is a polysaccharide found in vegetables.
While the fruit is broken down mechanically in the stomach, it is not broken down chemically until the third or fourth stage of digestion in the intestines.
The starch is broken down into three different stages, starting in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sugary foods immediately after a meal.
When you eat sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "trapped" in the stomach along with other food, where it is not chemically digested and begins to spoil.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates, or other carbohydrates with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, or other sour fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, found in saliva, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat combinations of eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs, or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk, or nuts and milk and similar protein-rich foods at the same meal.
Their digestion requires different digestive juices, each with a different strength, characteristics and time of arrival in the stomach.
Watermelon, honeydew melon, nutmeg and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach with other foods.
Fat combined with protein-rich products.
Fat works well with starch, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fat inhibits protein digestion.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you eat a lot of protein, avoid fat altogether.
This also applies to freshness - it is not advisable to combine a large amount of nuts (containing protein) with a whole avocado (containing fat).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
What's the best way to cook?
"Cooking and heat treatment cause a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient content of the products", says the nutritionist.
Most nutrients are lost when food is cooked in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods is enhanced by cooking.
It is best to use the liquid left after cooking vegetables to make soup - this will preserve the nutrients that remain in the water and will allow you to eat them later.
Vegetables should also be cooked by steaming.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
Cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes increases the lycopene content by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow and orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural characteristics of their proteins, making them more easily digestible.
Similarly, heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing may reduce the vitamin C content by between 10% and 90%, while freezing the solvent has no effect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the body's absorption of iron, which in turn improves brain and muscle function.
Our bodies absorb up to 33% less non-heme iron from plant foods such as beans, leafy greens and cereals than heme iron from animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can greatly increase your body's absorption of non-haem iron by eating non-haem iron products with sources of vitamin C such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-haem iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to muscles and the brain.
To get the most benefit from your salad, add healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil.
When making salmon sandwiches, add vitamin-D-rich salmon or sardines to unsweetened yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium in the intestines and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grains) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, blackberries, oats, and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels and prevent clogging of the arteries.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect criticized for caricaturing Asians
Snapchat representatives say the filter is inspired by an animation, but some commenters claim it is racially insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to alter reality and play with their identity in absurd ways.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple or a dog or a statue that would look good in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blurry, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million distorted selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public knowledge.
Snapchat's lens effects have been criticized in the past, receiving accusations that the app promotes too dark noses or light facial skin tones as a standard of ideal beauty.
New lens effects were released this week, allowing users to create slanted eyes, slanted teeth and round faces, in what some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - the "yellow gene".
It was also questioned whether such conflicts were indicative of wider diversity problems at the company.
News and public denial erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens is to depict Anime characters, not caricature people of Asian descent.
But for people who had experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the resemblance to Anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, tweeted about the images, saying in an email that the lens effects were "offensive and uncomfortable to say the least".
She added that it's hard not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This shows that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture, too, is engaged in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat's large, racially diverse audience of young people, as opposed to older demographics, is more sensitive to this kind of thing.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, "these things don't go unnoticed these days", 25-year-old Katie Zhou said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her Medium post and in a phone interview, she explained that she believes the racial issues stem from Snapchat's employment policies, which do not adequately support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the company's mostly white male management and then ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means there's no racial diversity in the company, so they're allowing this kind of decision", says Zhou, a Chinese-American.
Her opinion is shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees of different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the backgrounds of its employees, but a spokesperson revealed that the company has hired a human resources specialist who will focus on bringing underrepresented racial minorities into the company and promoting inclusion.
Zhou, on the other hand, did not renew his Snapchat account, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to realize that this is wrong".
The House Intelligence Committee is reporting that military officials have distorted reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement released Thursday, the White House said officials at U.S. Central Command had distorted reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
Central Command intelligence analysts express widespread dissatisfaction with the interim report of a task force created by Republican representatives of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, indicating that their leadership controlled reports of American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report is that the intelligence reports, confirmed by senior Centcom leaders, painted a more positive picture of the U.S. fight against terrorism than was actually the case.
Ken Calvert, a Republican representative from California, says: "The actions of the Centcom are unacceptable - it is our soldiers who suffer when our policymakers are misinformed".
CENTCOM's management failures are to be found at the highest levels of the organisation.
This 10-page report details challenges in Central Command's reporting and analysis of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the redactions, it does suggest that Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports of the Central Command to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives have publicly stated that the operation to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq still under the control of the Islamic State.
Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas reported: "A months-long investigation makes this abundantly clear".
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, senior U.S. Central Command officials distorted reports to portray the ISIS threat in Iraq as less than it actually was.
The Republican Party formed a task force after learning that analysts feared information about the Islamic State was being distorted.
As the investigation continues, new revelations in the case will follow Thursday's report.
The Department of Defense Inspector General conducts investigations of Centcom's intelligence activities.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Oversight Committee released their own report Thursday in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
In his report, Representative Adams B. Schiff, a Democrat, says that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom was too restricted in its ability to produce intelligence assessment reports on ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the flow of information", undermined the analysts' work ethic, and "spread false facts".
But Schiff and the Democrats added that there is no evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports according to "a predetermined or political agenda".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional inquiry on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general was investigating complaints by Centcom analysts.
A Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report pending an investigation.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community encourage a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The inquiry is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (a question raised by a growing number of Defence Department officials).
But accusations over the past year have raised questions about whether President Obama can fully trust the Central Command's reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of the Islamic State's spying harks back to more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the war in Afghanistan with too little thought to its possible consequences.
Hooker also played a significant role in exposing the Islamic State's spying.
Last year, officials reported that Hooker's team discovered that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil facilities had not significantly damaged the terrorist group's finances because they had set up makeshift facilities to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in its September edition that the discovery had not spread beyond Central Command.
The commander of Centcom at the time, General Lloyd Austin III, received sharp criticism because many lawmakers felt that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the women's field hockey match between the United States and Great Britain, the United States wins for the fourth time in a row.
A day after defeating Japan 6-1, Katie Baum scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Scoring five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said that she could not recall ever having done that before.
And she said, "I have no idea".
I'm not the kind of guy who counts his points.
But she knows that the U.S. is 4-0 in the Olympics, putting them in a tie with Great Britain, which remained undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday for the final matches of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take first place in the six-team group and which team will take second.
The first-placed team will avoid meeting the strong Dutch team, the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
However Saturday's game plays out, the Americans have already caused a stir by finishing last out of 12 teams in London four years ago.
And Bama was on that team.
She grew up in Bluebell, first picked up a field hockey stick at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already playing the sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the team's history.
She didn't qualify for the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the final.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, things changed for the better when England's Craig Parham was appointed manager.
Bama called it "cultural, mental, and physical change".
We didn't do as much work in London as we're doing now.
We have changed absolutely everything.
In Thursday's game, Bama opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close range.
India started the game without a win, but their selection was very keen and kept a minimum score of 0-1 until the end of the third period, when Bama scored again.
She put the ball into the opposing zone on the left side of the court, then managed to get to the center of the court and send the ball into the opponents' goal, putting the Americans 2-0 ahead.
Midway through the fourth quarter, Melissa Gonzalez scored another touchdown.
This was U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Brigg's first dry game, conceding one goal in each of his first three games.
She's in the way.
And so is Bama.
"We're doing very well right now", Paham said, but just how well will be determined by Saturday's game.
The most depressing food to eat during a depression is a hearty meal
In March of 1933, shortly after his inauguration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the Oval Office for a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed such delicacies as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
On this occasion, however, his meal was much more modest - scrambled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and plum pudding.
Says Jane Ziegelman: "It's a way of showing solidarity in cooking for people who have had a really hard time".
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to Americans about how they should eat".
There's a couple in Brooklyn Heights who are food historians.
Kou's latest book, The Garden Fury, describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman, in his book 97 Apples, describes life through food in a tenement on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
Their new collaborative work, "A Satisfying Meal", to be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
In a show of culinary solidarity, they shared a meal together at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a humble lunch spot in the Flatiron District that dates back to 1929, the start of the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmann, 54, ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while Kou, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potato and vegetable salad.
When the reporter ordered the fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about food during the Great Depression.
Mrs. Siegelman said that the fake bunny was very popular.
There was the peanut gallery, the liver gallery, and the bean gallery.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it would be like to eat enough peanuts to replace your lunch.
Mr. Koo was stunned.
"It must have felt like my stomach was full of lead", he added.
In the years before the Depression, the American dinner table was a smorgasbord, especially in rural areas.
The women cooked meals for their male workers and served freshly made soups for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to Europe. "The Full Meal" describes how Americans adapted to a time when America was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
"At that time, food was becoming the main focus of the American people's daily lives", says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this particular subject.
Equally important were the new budget diets, in which unfamiliar foods such as fake rabbit and stir-fries became common, stir-fries being "a great way to use up leftovers", said Ziegelmann, because chefs could hide unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Cheap dried fruit replaced fresh fruit.
Meat, long a staple of American meals, was now an extremely rare luxury.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, never-before-seen formations were born.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmann found recipes for onions stuffed with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the dinner table".
"It was surreal", says Siegelman.
Peanut butter and fried onions don't mix.
Many homemade recipes are suitable for times of hardship.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the nation's eating habits, which had not been experienced before or since the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged housewives to become "economists" and take on such challenges as turning a pasta and carrot mixture into a tasty meal.
The Satisfying Meal is a feast of historical delights.
Particularly interesting is evidence of the government's attitude toward its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
Although in public he talked about his humble upbringing and eating in Iowa, in reality he ate like the refined millionaire he had become.
"He enjoyed European dishes, such as fish and cucumber sauce", says Mr. Ko.
He ate in a near-gilded hotel room wearing a dinner jacket.
He was completely out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not urged him to set an example with his eating habits.
Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who did not know how to cook, and the White House became a place "where not only was some of the worst food in Washington served, but the worst food was cooked", says the book.
As the nation's economy recovered, most of the Depression-era culinary traditions disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, as well as the application of science to cooking, added Ms. Ziegelman.
The couple said that writing the book helped them to understand more about Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as her inability to throw away food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food", said Mr. Kou.
Ms. Siegelman said, "She was really upsetting people".
There was an incident with a windmill once.
While we were eating at the Eisenberg Diner, a couple of the writers pulled out of their bag a homemade dessert: plum pudding, which President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's a feather duster", said Mrs. Ziegelmann, adding that it was a common practice at the time to call modest dishes chic.
It contains no powder, just prunes, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone eagerly dipped their chopsticks into the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Koo ate a few more dumplings.
Following the advice of an experienced "economist", he said to his wife: "Grind the hazelnuts a little".
Gilead will be reimbursed for the legal costs of fighting Merck over the Hepatitis C patent.
A district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the legal fees it paid in the Hepatitis C patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was acquitted of a $200 million fine for infringing two Merck patents related to its successful Sovaldi and Harvoni pills when a U.S. federal judge found violations by Merck, such as perjury and other unethical practices.
At a hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Freeman ruled that Gilead is entitled to recover the legal costs it incurred defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain market share against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are 90% effective against liver disease.
The case was initiated back in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
U.S.-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State fighters have left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently clearing the city of the last remaining opposition fighters.
They have released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"We are now in full control of the city and we are searching for fighters", he told Reuters.
The Clintons' income in 2015 was $10.75 million and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million that year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, Clinton donated US$1 million, mostly to her Clinton Charities. Former President Bill Clinton earned an estimated $5.3 million from speaking engagements and former Secretary of State earned a $3 million income from her book about working at the State Department, published in association with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anna Holtone, have released their tax returns for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set a new standard for financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, a Clinton campaign associate, in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind various excuses and reservations to avoid having to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax information.
Public disclosure of taxpayer information is standard practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite an IRS audit as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
"Your move", in a tweet about the Democratic candidate's tax returns, was posted by Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sam.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the audit was complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, claim that his withdrawal raises questions about the true extent of his assets, donations and other business ties, including his ties to Russia.
Clinton added fuel to the fire by releasing a video Friday in which several prominent Republicans demand that Trump release his tax returns.
She returned to the issue during an economic speech Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades".
Politico reported that Trump paid little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist reported on Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, supporting a proposal by billionaire Warren Buffett, is promoting the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30% in taxes.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
During Clinton's speech last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, Buffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also being audited by the IRS and Trump is afraid of the voters, not the IRS.
The Clinton campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons now reside in Chappaqua, New York and paid an average federal tax rate of approximately 32 percent and a total tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of her income is salary.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons received $109,000 in dividends.

A Jewish film director criticizes a Berlin hotel for disconnecting an Israeli long-distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has caused a furore on social media after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli dial-in code.
Claude Lanzmann, director of the Holocaust documentary film Shoah, made no secret of his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the long-distance telephone code for Israel on a list provided by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from a hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel is denied and destroyed?
It says Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol offers to call that country through its call centre.
The director demanded an explanation from the hotel staff.
The Lancet said it was "shocked" by the response.
The hotel manager explained that 'this was a conscious decision by the management of the hotel'.
The reason for the removal of the code further enraged the film's director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be deleted", Lanzmann quotes a hotel employee as saying.
According to the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, Jacob Hadas-Handelsmann, Israel's ambassador to Germany, called the incident "a great shame".
We are shocked and appalled by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this happened in Germany, in this particular hotel chain, is even more humiliating.
No explanation is necessary.
The official stated: "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
The event was also widely shared on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply acquired the Arab as a client.
Another message read "shame on you", indicating that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm next to a synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel quickly denied all accusations, stating that it was a "misunderstanding", and apologized to Lancôme.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of countries", a Kempinski spokesman was quoted as saying by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, as students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The trouble started when law enforcement tried to evict the students, prompting the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, foresees the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools in order to save money.
Some protesters painted graffiti against interim president Michel Temer.
The protest took place just days after students gathered for a demonstration in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the Senate.
Scotsman Callum Skinner finishes first to bring Britain a gold medal in cycling
Kelham Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Velodrome last night as Team GB defended their championship title won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played a key role in the race, making Scotland's legendary Sir Chris Hoy proud and handing the victory to favourites New Zealand.
Four years ago, Great Britain won a surprise victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championships in London, even though Hoey had already retired.
Problems arose between the Beijing and London Olympics when experienced launch specialist Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They pulled it off at the last minute.
When Hoey left, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill his shoes.
The British coaches had high hopes for Skinner, seeing potential in him, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenya, the champions who started four years ago with Howe and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the best start of the race was by the New Zealand team.
Nevertheless, the British trio won gold medals.
Hinds was closing in on his own lap, Kenney had taken the lead and Skinner was defending it.
The change in strategy played a big part in the win, as Hinds went into a higher gear to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to go faster.
Hoey watched the race as a BBC correspondent and captured the look in the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hinds as they climbed the podium.
A 23-year-old Glaswegian said: "It was an indescribable privilege".
I'm doing everything I can to protect my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no greater victory.
After winning with Kenya and Ho in the 2012 London Olympics, Hindes admitted that he deliberately crashed after a poor start.
He later retracted this comment and the British competitors were not able to prove otherwise.
This time there was no such incident.
Hindes said: "The British flags in the stands were reminiscent of London".
In the last three months, we've become a close-knit team.
We've lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will go to the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is any indication of the team's progress over the past five months, the next five days are going to be very exciting.
Given Kenya's track record, he could very well match Hoy's achievement of winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold medals and one silver medal, and Kenya is also born on March 23 (which seems to be a sacred date for the British, as Steve Regev, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on this day).
That's also the date that Hoey was born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that begins today and continues for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "Right now I'm just enjoying it.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
Honestly, it's a little lonely to win by yourself".
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
It was the only medal event that day, but it wasn't the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Owen Doull set the fastest qualifying times in the four-kilometre individual medley.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
Round one and the final will take place later today, with Wigan sure to be in the spotlight.
Yesterday before qualifying, he had a disagreement with the commissioner when the judges called him in to measure his height.
In the women's race, which continues and concludes today, Laura Trout, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation is hoping that the British cycling team will, hopefully, win medals at the mid-term Olympics.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performances in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same in Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, accusations of sexism and assault have led to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton and the retirements of Hoye and Victoria Bendleton.
But as the first races of the velodrome get under way, it looks as if Britain, as always, will reach its peak in good time.
The future of the Portland smelter hangs in the balance after the cancellation of a huge contract.
The future of an aluminium smelter and hundreds of its workers in Portland, Victoria, has been thrown into doubt after its main customer, an energy company, announced its withdrawal.
This announcement is based on the Victorian Government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue operating.
Twenty years of subsidies will end in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at risk.
Both direct and indirect jobs could be at risk by the year 2000.
In addition, there will be unforeseen side effects as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is operating at a loss and may be shut down.
These events triggered years of speculation about the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the factory's production costs.
The UK authorities maintain that the AGL has not been designed to encourage the use of recycled aggregates.
The power plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumia, with additional stakes held by the Chinese holding company CITIC and the Japanese holding company Marubeni Corp.
The UK authorities maintain that the AGL is not intended to reduce the environmental impact of the extraction of china clay and ball clay.
The UK authorities maintain that the AGL has not been designed to promote the use of recycled aggregates.
The agreements have a duration of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
The UK authorities maintain that the AGL has not been designed to encourage the extraction of aggregates for aggregates use.
As of FY2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
The UK authorities maintain that the exemption for by-products of china clay and ball clay extraction does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the agreements will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating the smelter or supplying it with energy.
The US company reports that it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but that it will be terminated in November.
Analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry's weak economy.
Steven Mickelson, chief executive of AGL, said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts a year and Tomago 900 megawatts.
If these two plants were to disappear from the energy market, energy demand would decrease significantly.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community Judicial Centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 applications are rejected each year, and budget cuts could make the situation worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without the means to fight unlawful eviction - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, already overburdened, warns that cuts in funding will only make matters worse.
As of next June, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Law Centre, said that a recent report by the National Association of Law Centres revealed that thousands of people who need legal help are being denied it.
Mr. Farrell has indicated that if this decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
He adds: "Queensland's legal centre is chronically underfunded, denying help to thousands who need it".
People trying to get out of abusive relationships, people in deep debt, families going through divorce, workers who are being unfairly fired -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they're not getting the help that they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent, meaning thousands more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately halt the funding cuts so that people who need legal help can get it.
Last year the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of local communities and their customers, and for the Palaczuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign is being sued after an employee pulled a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign managers were sued for failing to act on information that their North Carolina operations manager would turn a gun on an employee while they were traveling in the same car in February.
The incident was detailed in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte federal court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for an internal inquiry into the case to be opened, but realised it would not happen.
The leader, Earl Phillips, "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and turned the barrel toward Vincent's knee", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that when he complained to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had suffered the same fate.
"Weapons do not have to be fired in order to cause damage", Bordini states in his complaint.
Just two days before this lawsuit was filed, a Republican presidential candidate caused a scandal by telling people that Second Amendment people -- gun owners and enthusiasts -- would take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the election and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign issued a statement saying the media had taken his words out of context and that he had never incited violence.
Bordini is seeking damages from the campaign for negligent supervision and damages from Phillips for assault, unlawful use of a weapon and causing emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks had no immediate comment.
I haven't been able to reach Phillip.
WCCB, Charlotte's local news service, is reporting that Philip has recently left the campaign.
His consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was also unable to be reached.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein.
A new tradition - village and sports festivals in Kyulcie.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered for a town and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that the Festival of Ezra would not be held.
A new page has been turned.
The day began with a sports competition.
This time the contests were not held in the traditional manner and were not taken too seriously. For example, the javelin had to be thrown at a lying target, the javelin flew, the throw was made with the left hand, and the "bouncing" was not included in any Olympic games.
However, each participant could demonstrate his strength, courage, agility, and resilience.
After the games, everyone gathered on the open-air stage for the town's festivities.
At that time, there was also a "kid's corner" where the little ones could play in the inflatable rides and get a new figure in the facial makeup.
In what could also become a tradition, there was a car show with both tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone was addressed by Inge Kadike-Skadiņa, head of the district administration of Kyulciema, who wished everyone a pleasant rest and dry weather.
The festivities continued with the welcoming of the newest residents of Hogsmeade.
It's really good to have five girls and a boy in the ward.
Amateur art groups from the Engure region came to the village with performances - the spectators really liked the performances of the senior dance group "Autumn Rhythm", "Redas" of various national dance performers and "Golden Pearls" of young dancers.
And it didn't matter that someone slipped on the wet stage.
Of course, the local people and guests were delighted by the famous actor duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Biržai from the fishermen's set "Dieniņas".
There was a band called the Bruges.
Britain needs to keep the Olympic spirit alive and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
That, I think, is what makes Heathrow so attractive, as it was in London in 2012, where we invested a huge amount of work to make sure that all regions of the country are beneficiaries of the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eastend gained enormously from the Olympics.
And we will do so again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally end youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
Just like the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who think this is too big a challenge and that the Heathrow expansion is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be ready in time for the Olympics and that it would be a worldwide failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012, and they won't be right about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome them all so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole rather than individuals.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs, 211 billion in economic growth, creating a breeding ground for both jobs and experience at this airport and across the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has created an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, on time and on budget, from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years running, to Terminal 2, which is built between the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion marks.
The London 2012 Olympic Games were a great success, and I'm sure the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new environment for employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is a board member of Heathrow and a former Secretary of State for Trade in the Treasury.
In Switzerland, a woman runs onto a highway in an attempt to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, the victim lies down on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when she was run over by several cars on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident occurred shortly after midnight on Thursday on the A1 near the town of Morges in the canton of Vaud.
According to a report by the Wa County police, the woman had been lying on the road in a desperate attempt to commit suicide when she was hit by several cars in the dark.
In an apparent suicide attempt, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, crashed several vehicles, including a heavy-duty truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but others are still at large, police said, calling on drivers and witnesses to come forward.
A criminal investigation has also been opened, which is a logical step, according to lawyer Gilles Hofsteller in Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Could the collision have been avoided?
Hofsteller adds: "That is for the prosecutor to determine".
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on a highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect a pedestrian to be on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of manslaughter after she hit a sleeping man in the middle of the night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later fell asleep at the wheel.
The court found that the policeman on the way to the scene of the accident was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, and the judge acknowledged that the man lying on the road was "a completely unforeseeable and extraordinary event".
Anyone with information about Thursday's accident near Morges is asked to contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A call for expressions of interest for the post of the new Head of the NIS shall be launched on the Internet.
The petition portal Avaaz.org has started collecting signatures for a competition for the new head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), states that society wants a transparent and professional appointment process.
The petition was created on August 10 and currently has 55 signatures.
The selection process of Ms Inge Kolegava for the position of Director-General of the NIS is not transparent and professional.
It recalls the best traditions of Soviet officials.
This discredits the government and once again causes public disillusionment with the government and politicians.
'There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be judged,' the petition reads.
Its author Jānis B. has indicated that the public does not know the criteria by which Koļegova was selected for the post.
It is also unclear what the candidate's intentions are for the SNE position.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should introduce a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively interviewed, recruitment specialists are recruited and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola last week officially nominated Kolegov for the position of head of the Interior Ministry, this week the government was supposed to confirm him in his new position, but all ministers of the "Unity" party voted against, so the issue was postponed for a week.
If we lost, I must have played badly.
Swimming volleyball players Aleksandr Samoilov and Jānis Šmēdiņš hoped for a medal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, after leaving the tournament, Samoilov said that there is no difference in where to finish the competition.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) to the Brazilians Evandro Gonçalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado in the final and decisive game of the subgroup tournament on Thursday, ending their participation in the most important sports forum of the four years.
In the three subgroup matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more pairs.
Subsequently, the ratio of small points between the three pairs was calculated, which was the most unfavorable for the Latvian duo after the convincing loss suffered in this match.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we remained at 16 points", Smedić recalled the course of the game.
I don't even know how we got zero points for the rest of the set.
You can't play like that.
And then in the second set, everything was fine, and in the end of the set, we broke the game, and that should be a good foundation for the third set.
We started out similar, but after switching sides, only one team improved.
We made too many mistakes on offense.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so the small points were important.
"We should have played more evenly instead of giving up three or four points in a row", he said.
We knew Evandra could be seen.
"In the first set we coped with it, in the second we conceded 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already lost the game", Šmēdiņš recalled.
We tried to play our best game.
Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn't.
I didn't watch the scoreboard before the game, but we knew we needed as many little points as possible.
"If we lost, I must have played badly", said Samoilov.
We expected a good serve from Evander, and we handled it pretty well in the first set, but in the third, he opened up and it was hard to attack.
I, on the other hand, made many mistakes on Pedro's serve, but I had to deal with them.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, the athletes were not nervous today.
"We walked, we played, we defended, but we needed a better serve", he said.
"They played well and finally made it to the urn".
We said right before the tournament that this was the most embarrassing lottery ever.
We had a chance to fight for first place, but we didn't even make it out of the group.
"Everyone expected a medal from us and we expected a medal from ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th place or fourth", said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I thought it was a no-brainer for us to keep playing together because it's just one tournament.
Samoilov was in Rio de Janeiro for the third Olympic Games in his career, because in 2008 in Beijing he started together with Martinis Pļaviņš, but four years ago in London he played together with Ruslan Sorokin.
It was only his second Olympic start.
In addition, the Commission notes that Latvia has not provided any evidence that the aid was limited to the minimum necessary.
State-owned energy company Latvenergo is following the process of opening up the gas market from the perspective of both a consumer and a potential trader, the company's press secretary Ivita Bider said.
'Latvenergo's decision whether to enter the gas market as a trader in the future will depend on the gas market model and legal framework that will be created.'
"That is why we are actively involved in drafting and commenting on legislation and making our own proposals", explains Bider.
The BNS agency has already written that the Ministry of Economy (EM), in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gāze, has developed a draft Cabinet Regulation "Regulations for the Trading and Use of Natural Gas" that will change the operating principles of the existing natural gas market by ensuring the right of natural gas users to freely choose a natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
In working towards a new natural gas market regulation, the EU aims to make the process of natural gas trading as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the 'trader-centric model' was chosen as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, where all customer-related activities are provided by the trader, with one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service point, leaving the technical aspects of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
It is recalled that there is a gradual opening of the market for household customers: even after 3 April 2017, household customers who do not wish to switch supplier will be able to continue to receive natural gas from an existing supplier at a regulated price, thus becoming connected customers.
'In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader', the Ministry informed.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trading contract.
Until the conclusion of the contract for the sale of natural gas, natural gas will be sold to traders for a certain period of time by the existing natural gas trader at a price determined by him.
The draft Cabinet Regulation discusses in detail the rights and obligations of natural gas traders, system operators and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply and the interruption of the supply of natural gas to customers, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gas installation with regard to the supply and use of natural gas, the arrangements for the settlement of accounts for services received, the rates of default interest, the arrangements for the switching of traders and the supply of customers in the event of disruption of the supply of natural gas, and the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to connected customers by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to decide on the increase in the salary of the Director-General of the NIS.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS)) plans to talk with Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (ZZS) and the government coalition partners next week about the increase in the salary of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the salary of the Director-General of the Public Prosecutor's Office had to be resolved urgently in order to make the post more attractive to potential candidates.
There will also be a discussion next week about changing the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she could not think of any particular candidate to approach for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, would have been a good Director-General of the Environmental Inspectorate.
On the other hand, with regard to the current acting Head of the NIS, Ms Daci Pelėko, who expressed her willingness to stand for the post, the Minister reiterated her view that the new Director-General of the NIS should be an 'outsider' and should not come from within the NIS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from vacation in order to push through the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the VID as soon as possible.
BNS has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, has submitted a request to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), in which she withdraws her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Environmental Service.
In her petition, she stated that it was not an easy choice, but that during the past two weeks, her family had suffered severe emotional distress even though they had done nothing wrong.
Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the controversy between the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It is also reported that the previous Director-General of the NIS, Ināra Pētersone, left her post at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock market indices in the US and Europe are rising, as is the value of the US dollar.
Global oil prices continued to rise on Friday morning, buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister, raising expectations that the major oil-producing countries will take steps to stabilise the world oil market at the OPEC meeting in September.
The three major U.S. stock indexes on Thursday hit record highs not seen since 1999.
The main positive factor for the market was the increase in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of a number of companies were also behind the rise in European stock market indices on Thursday.
The US dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen on Thursday.
The electronic trading price of WTI crude oil for delivery on the New York Stock Exchange increased by USD 1,78 to USD 43,49 per barrel on Thursday, September.

The turnover of the canning company Blue Lagoon fell by 33,8% last year.
The turnover of the canned food producer "Blue Lagoon" last year was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the database "Lursoft".
The management report of the company states that in 2015 the company operated at a loss due to several reasons, including a persistent lack of working capital caused by the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating the previously existing credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and benefit from a volume discount.
The bank's withdrawal from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing projects supported by the European Union Structural Funds, which would have enabled the yard to acquire new production equipment and modernise its infrastructure.
The company's financial generators were also negatively affected last year by the increase in raw material prices and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the company's products.
'Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognised the price change and were ready to buy at the new - higher - prices', the company's management states.
In addition, the Commission expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the measures with the internal market, in particular as regards their compatibility with the internal market under Article 107 (3) (c) TFEU.
The investors have already visited the company's largest creditor, UniCredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concludes that the restructuring plan ensures the restoration of the long-term viability of the Bank.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes to achieve higher productivity and production capacity.
'Several machines have been purchased to increase the production speed', the company's management stated.
The management of the Blue Lagoon notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's plant to fulfil orders that were previously not possible.
The first production batch to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the MoUs for the sale of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the MoUs.
The new product will increase turnover by approximately EUR 300 thousand per month,' the company's management states.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement for the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
Blue Lagoon has shipped its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded its sales market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US this September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Lagoon operated with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and a loss of EUR 5,113 million.
Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mihail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Shirshon (10,89%).
We invite you to meet the film diva Zara Leander at the museum at 15th Street and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the beloved film diva Zarah Leander.
Zara Leander's visit to her godmother Ruta, who was the wife of the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 turned out to be fateful, because it was she who discovered the unusual low contralto for Zara Leander's wife, which she used when debuting on the stage of the Riga Cabaret Theatre.
Perhaps it was a chance feeling in Riga that became a fateful turning point in Zara's creative path towards world fame.
Sara Leander had fond memories of Riga, and she had hoped to attend visiting exhibitions there.
Using the form of the play, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the role of the great Zara Leander will be played by the great Ieva Kerēvica.
Extensive traffic restrictions have been imposed in the Aglona area.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven, the transit traffic of trucks on several state highways in the vicinity of Aglona will be closed from 17.00 on 12 August to 18.00 on 15 August this year, informed VAS Latvijas Valsts ceļi.
Participants in the Aglona festival and public transport will not be affected by these restrictions.
It should be noted that the section of the motorway P62 Kraslava-Preiļi-Madona from Kraslava to Kraslava station (0,80-4,00 km) is under construction and only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross the construction site during the Aglona festivities.
For other road users, traffic will be provided on the bypass - scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants, including pilgrims, attend these celebrations.
Motorists should therefore exercise particular caution as there will be heavy pedestrian traffic on various sections of the motorway towards Aglona.
We urge drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions in place, to respect the rules of the road and to allow for any extra travel time.
Water temperatures in all bodies of water have dropped below 20 degrees Celsius.
According to the Latvian Centre of Environment, Geology and Meteorology, the water temperature will continue to drop as the weather gets colder, and it is now below 20 degrees Celsius in all rivers, lakes, and the sea.
In the sea, the water will cool to +16..+18 degrees, on the west coast of the Gulf of Riga, the water temperature will drop to +13 degrees in some places due to the wind.
In the Great River and the Danube, as well as in the large lakes, the water temperature is +18..+20 degrees, in other water bodies +14..+19 degrees.
A year ago, on August 12, the water temperature in rivers and lakes reached +24..+25 degrees Celsius in some places, and the southern coast of the Gulf of Riga had water up to +22 degrees Celsius.
A Russian military plane has been identified near the Latvian border.
A Russian military plane has been identified near the Latvian border, BNS has learned from the National Armed Forces.

BNS has repeatedly reported that Russian army planes and navy ships are regularly detected near Latvia's borders.
Two children were sexually assaulted at an amusement park in England.
Police in Berkshire, England, are searching for an assailant who sexually abused two six-year-old girls at the Legoland theme park, reports the Daily Mail.
Police are asking parents to check photos taken at the amusement park for possible images of the attacker.
The girls told their parents what had happened.
The man was unknown to the girls, Caucasian, and in his 20's.
Kurdish activists occupy German public broadcaster.
A group of 30 Kurds occupied the WDR building in Düsseldorf on Thursday evening and held a protest for almost two hours, reports the German police.
The protesters, who came with placards, chanted various slogans in an attempt to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials report that the demonstration was generally peaceful and the protesters eventually left the building voluntarily at the request of the staff.
The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers whose flight is cancelled at the airport on a Wednesday.
If Insurance paid travel insurance compensation to a family for the cancelled flight at Riga airport on Wednesday 10 August, which forced them to abandon their planned visit to the music festival.
On 11 August, If Insurance received a claim from a customer.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to the cancellation of a flight at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged a reimbursement of EUR 204 for the booked accommodation, which could no longer be cancelled, and for the festival tickets purchased.
On the other hand, the airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money they spend on airline tickets.
On average, 15% of all travel insurance claims paid out by If Insurance were for travel interruption or cancellation.
"These trips cover the cost of purchasing, returning or exchanging tickets and booking accommodation", says Dagnija Rutka, head of the personal risk insurance product at If Insurance.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concludes that the measures under assessment constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
A man is forced to leave his home because of a neighbor's construction project.
LTV's Studio 4 spoke with Dmitry Saydyashev, whose neighbor has started a major renovation of his apartment.
The problem is that my neighbors did some illegal construction, and my apartment has a broken ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Building Committee, the building manager, and other organizations.
The building department said we're not an operations department and we don't have any experts.
"The owner has to go to the Latvian Association of Engineers, and an expert will be there", says Dmitry.
The expert arrived, verified the situation and concluded that the cladding was in poor condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry first filed a complaint with the building department, and as of early this week, no one has been able to say whether his apartment is safe.
The housing authority said, that's the law, wait, if you're not happy, write to everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they forwarded the letter to the building manager, who then sent it back to the building committee, and that was the end of it", says Dmitry.
After reviewing all the paperwork, it's clear that the construction has been halted, although every once in a while you can hear someone working there.
An expert's report was due within two months, and the owner of the apartment, who was carrying out the repairs, had six months in which to remedy the defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his report, but the Municipality considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grating in this load-bearing structure is damaged, so there is no certainty that the occupant of the apartment below is endangered.
"That is why we have requested additional explanations from this expert", says Ilze Žuka, a representative of the Riga City Building Department.
Despite a ban on any repairs on the top floor, the construction continues.
The fine for building without a building permit ranges from 70 to 700 euros, but it can be much higher.
Pending the expert's report, the building committee has decided that both apartments - the one being built and Dmitry's - should be condemned.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the building authority, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have endangered not only their own property, but also the owner of the property below, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property", says a representative of the building authority.
Now Dmitry has to find another place to live - with relatives, friends, a hotel, or another apartment.
But Dmitry could try to recover damages from his neighbor in a civil suit, which could take a very long time.
Because of the arbitrary construction, both apartments are currently off-limits to the public until the developer gives his approval, which can take up to three weeks.
The owner of the dwelling where the repair work was carried out will be liable for damages.
The owner of this apartment is also facing up to six months in prison for failing to comply with a court order.
Guess what.
How many lions are in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white cubs were born at the Demidov Zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels good and occasionally pees on the potty, even though the potty is feeding the babies.
The transformation of the former Kemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, a representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Kemeri", told LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage in the restoration of the former sanatorium in Kemer.
The second phase will be a wellness clinic, scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
Želva notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the former outpatient clinic of the Kemer resort, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be spread over three floors.
Park Hotel Chemeri and the proposed clinic are owned by the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe is owned by a number of investors who invest in the fund, according to Želve.
As previously stated by George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, the investment in the former health resort is expected to be between EUR 12 and 15 million, with a total investment of more than EUR 30 million.
It has already been reported that in the renovation of the cultural and historical park with an area of more than 42 hectares, in the renovation of footpaths and street sections, in the construction of an interactive nature tourism facility, in the improvement of the area and in the construction of a parking lot on Emil Dārziņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the City Council of Jurmala plans to attract 14.5 million euros from European Union funds, co-financing with three to four million euros.
Design work is scheduled to be completed by mid-2017, while construction and fitting-out work will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported, a five-star hotel, Park Hotel Chemeri, and a wellness clinic are to be built in the historic Chemeri Sanatorium complex.
However, reconstruction took time.
The 2010 report also stated that 'Ominasis is in regular communication with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical supervision of the Kemeri Sanatorium', and that 'the reconstruction of the future Kemeri Hotel will definitely be completed in 2011' and that preparations for the opening of a Kempinski hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Ķemeri confirmed its willingness to purchase the entire property of the sanatorium in Ķemeri, owned by the insolvent Ominasis Latvia, in an auction, but a month later the auction was declared void because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set at the starting price of EUR 2,86 million of the last auction that did not take place.
As LETA was informed by the representative of the city council Ieva Aile, the municipality, by signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of co-financing from the European Union Structural Funds, the adjacent infrastructure will be repaired - the historical Kemeri Park will be renovated, an interactive nature tourism facility will be created, roads and parking spaces will be arranged.
The President will present the surgeon Antonenko with the Order of the Three Stars.
President Raymond Veillon will award the Order of the Three Stars next week, August 16, to surgeon Alexander Antonenko, according to the presidential agenda.
The ceremony of awarding the Order of the Three Stars will take place in the House of the Blackheads at 13:00.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from the Jozefa Mediņa College of Music in 1998, where he studied wind instruments and singing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the Latvian Academy of Music in the class of Arvīds Lustes.
In 1997 he started singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, and in 1998 he debuted with the role of Oberto in G.F. Handel's opera "Alcina".
He received the "Grand Music Award 2003" for vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi's Requiem.
It is indicated that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, hired by the world's largest opera companies.
Since the autumn of 2004, he has sung at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, the Berlin and Graz Operas, the Semperoper in Dresden, the Royal Operas in Oslo and Stockholm, the Covent Garden Opera in London, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Operas and the Salzburg Festival.
Antonenko made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the role of the Prince in Nara in 2009 with great success.
In 2011, Antonenko sang the title role of "Othello" at the Paris Opera with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, at the Covent Garden Opera he sang Luigi in the new study of "The Settlement", and in Stockholm he participated in the production of "Girl from the West" by Christoph Loy.
A year later, Antonenko sang Othello with great success at the Covent Garden Opera in London.
Former NATO Commander Breedlove's e-mail was hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who broke into the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out several other cyberattacks, including breaking into the emails of Philip Breedlove, former commander of NATO forces in Europe, and the servers of George Soros' Open Society Institute, the business news agency Bloomberg reported Thursday.
The hackers released the information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, it contains Breedlove's list and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
Hackers had access to the institute's computers for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same Russian intelligence-linked hackers who hacked the DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the Obama administration is considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the DNC.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration would have to formally accuse Russia or Russian state-sponsored hackers of hacking Democratic Party servers.
In July, the website WikiLeaks reportedly published some 20,000 e-mails obtained from the DNC computer system showing that Democratic Party leaders had sought to damage the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton's former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
According to U.S. media reports, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hacking of Democratic servers, and other U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Russia's involvement in the cyberattack is almost certain.
McCartney: The Beatles were threatened by the presence of Yoko Ono.
Paul McCartney admitted that Yoko Ono's presence made the legendary group The Beatles feel threatened.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but during the time she went to visit the group in the recording studio, McCartney was afraid of her because Ono was the only woman among the members of the group - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When asked about the relationship, he told Rolling Stone magazine: "It's really good".
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group couldn't stand it.
We were able to do it, but not very successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexist, but the girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John started dating Yoko, she was not in the control room but among the four of us.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former band member Ringo, and from time to time confirms the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but otherwise The Beatles are "finished".
Asked if he was still seeing the only other living member of the legendary rock group, McCartney told Rolling Stone: "Not often".
We see each other at social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, so I feel a little disconnected.
I left Apple in the middle of a messy divorce.
I sent John Eastman to meetings in my place, and I said, "Tell me what everybody's saying, because I can't stand sitting at that table".
It was too painful, like watching your pet die.
The way the company works now, I just listen to all the tapes.
I'm part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
According to NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere composed almost entirely of carbon, ever had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate could be explained by its thick atmosphere.
But recent simulations suggest that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and that it rotated slowly.
The model also looks at the early topography of Venus.
It had more dry land than Earth, but it had enough water and geographic diversity to support life and keep the water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a GISS model simulation of the rotation of Venus, the model reveals that the daylight portion lasts for 2 months, explained GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the planet's surface and produces rain, which in turn forms thick cloud layers that act like an umbrella, shielding the planet from the sun's heat.
The result is a temperate climate temperature that is actually several degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus has been subjected to extreme heat and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the reefs were scorched by ultraviolet rays.
When the water evaporated completely, all that was left was a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, a deadly greenhouse gas - the Venus we know today.
Scientists have published the results of a new climate model for Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is stepping down as coach of the Avalanche.
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche head coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy submitted a letter of resignation, citing insufficient influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will begin the search for a new head coach immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have shown energy, enthusiasm, and determination in my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche", says Roy, 50.
This summer I've been thinking a lot about how I can improve the team's performance to give it the glow it needs to perform at a higher level.
In order to do that, the visions of the head coach and the VP of hockey operations have to be completely aligned with the visions of the organization.
He shall also have the possibility to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
Currently, these conditions are not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakic said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him well in his future endeavors.
In his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14, Roy was named the league's coach of the year and received the Jack Adams Award.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a 39-39-4 record, five points behind the Wild, missing the second round of the Western Conference playoffs.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Strikes by workers on the North Sea oil rigs over pay have been called off as the two sides in the dispute resume talks, according to negotiators.
There are periodic strikes against the Wood Group refinery on the North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Joint Statement states that the Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks, starting early next week, to re-examine issues of concern.
The trade unions stated that their recent action, organized after a break of more than 25 years, is directed against a planned wage cut of 30 percent.
As a result of negative market pressures, Wood Group has cut its North Sea workforce by 9% this year.
In 2014, the company had already reduced the wages of its onshore workers by 10%.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has already cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to close oil and gas operations in 10 countries to streamline its operations in preparation for a major merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, compounded by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not just individuals.
Almost USD 1,4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to USD 7 billion in the previous five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The latest mission of the Kepler telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data are helping astronomers to understand why the stars in this cluster rotate at different speeds and how the rotation rate of the stars is related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with those of other stars, we can learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system", says Luis Rebula, a scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, California.
The Pleiades star is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in this cluster are just beginning to mature, reaching an age of about 125 million years.
They're spinning as fast as they can.
As they swirl around at top speed, these growing stars give off huge amounts of stellar wind.
When the winds hit the star's magnetic field, they slow the star down.
Stars slow down as they age.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable region of stars, such as sunspots.
A recent catalog of rotation rates shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with taller dancers doing pirouettes more slowly than shorter ones.
Rebull explains that the Pleiades "ballet" shows that slow-spinning objects are larger and more massive, while faster-spinning objects are very small stars.
Because the Pleiades star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory for comparing stellar characteristics with rotation speeds.
Rebull explains that the Pleiades star helps to establish theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions, both older and younger.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down and stop spinning.
Rebull and his colleagues detailed their analysis of the rotation rates of Pleiades stars in three new papers soon to be published in the Astronomy Journal.
