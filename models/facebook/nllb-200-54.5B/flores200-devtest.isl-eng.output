While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate from Ebola, so far no drug has proved effective in curing existing infections.
One antibiotic compound, ZMapp, initially made its way into the field, but formal trials subsequently showed less benefit than was sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a comparator, meaning that researchers used the vaccine as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the unlimited need of the Olympic family to work toward a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional shape.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and a purple or carotenoid color below.
The discovery also reveals how birds' feathers have evolved.
Since dinosaur feathers have a poorly developed shaft, but have other features of feathers - rays and fin rays - scientists reasoned that the shaft must have evolved later.
The composition of the feathers suggests that they were used, not for flight, but for warmth or for appearance.
Researchers concluded that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not juvenile ones.

The galaxy exerts a pull on the Bogman's Dwarf Nebula as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides.
The scientists concluded that the dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is arranged around it as a kind of radiating sphere and made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In an interview, he said that he thought the new strain was "very difficult to treat and very dangerous because of the high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the plague in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 others if he comes in close contact with them.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of MDR-TB patients still appears to be very low, 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 patients infected at a given time in South Africa.

Elections in France have generally not been very technical: voters approach a polling station from a distance, mark a suitable candidate on a printed sheet of paper and then stick it in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law regulates the process in some detail.
Since 1998, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except from registered voters.
Candidates are allowed to send representatives to observe the entire process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following certain procedural rules.

The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want to build on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other issues discussed include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists that the force remain in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority wants it there for only five years.
Shots in the pesticide test were to be under the close supervision of a coast guard, who would monitor the test and evaluate its results.
A partnership between the NPWS and the National Shooting Society of Australia (NSW) led to the recruitment of qualified volunteers into the NSW shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service at the NPWS, the four snipers selected for the operation received extensive safety training.
Martelly yesterday swore in the nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended that the CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The constitutional committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some scheduled for 2011.
There have been some 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said that 27 accidents involving the equipment were known.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating to the company, which the company called "not serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's delay on the report "truly deplorable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported inland.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former police officer in the Philippines took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their tour bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly citizens, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later posed as an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He specialised in obstetrics and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of hormones accelerated lung growth in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also honored Luna's memory.
Tommy Dreamer said "1Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna fell from the night of the two moons. Something unique, like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as I was...even crazier...love her and will miss her...hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard had stated during the 2010 parliamentary election campaign that she believed a republic should be established in Australia when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom ended.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last royal head of state.
In the poll's most decisive choice, 29 percent wanted Australia to become a republic first, while 31 percent felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his integrity has been called into question.
He hasn't been able to take his pain-relieving medication because it's banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several parties confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have delivered water to the earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and be the source of life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of the earth, which was hit by a comet long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said that the rumor was "political journalism and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be added and trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and drop-off facilities are unavailable on site.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised questions about whether the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published last Thursday in the journal Science described the evolution of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, much longer than previously thought because of a cross between a terrestrial Darwin's finch, Geospiza herringbogi, and a cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape. It can be rolled into very small pieces.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided together. It can be hammered or rolled into thin strips.
The material could be thinned to such an extent that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of chemicals, and you can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The color of lime changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the material.
The oxygen level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Stir the two ingredients together, and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The sweat on your hands will affect the outer layer which acts a little weird and forms a semi-permanent shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of shell systems have been found in Minoan buildings in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call and relays it almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere reflects light and our view.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet high will be used to launch satellites or space telescopes into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transportation.
This has brought us trains, automobiles, and other forms of transportation.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and mammals.
Then there are many small cats (including pet cats) that eat considerably more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the chime, a special function that each cat is responsible for that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Groups consist of 1-3 adult males along with up to 30 females and juveniles.
The females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are strangely similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and also very deadly in their prey.
The tiger's all-encompassing anatomy enables it to climb (not very well, though), swim, leap great distances, and carry five able-bodied men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Cenus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like that of a full-grown lion but is more like a series of roaring, shouting words.
Parakeets prefer to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them. Almost all animals parakeets hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that cats track and locate animals for food by scent and by sniffing where they have walked on the ground.
With their night vision and stealthy movements, parrots catch their prey by diving into their environment and then quickly attacking their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a minority) is separated from the main species from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island, making it difficult to return), the environment often turns out to be different from what they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new inhabitants need different qualities or adaptability to be a strong competitor compared to what was before.
The original inhabitants have not changed, they still require the same adaptations as before.
In time, as the new inhabitants adjust to their new surroundings, they will look less and less like the original inhabitants.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two organisms will become so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This is called speciation, but it simply means that a new species comes into existence.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food using sunlight and photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, much of our food comes from plants, animals couldn't live without plants.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its day, afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw, with more than 70 serrated teeth and an extra set of teeth in the upper jaw, allowed it to escape anything that got in its way.
It is not certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, and like other mosasaur eels, it may have practiced autophagy.
It also attacked everything in the water, even the largest dinosaurs, such as the crocodile.
While most of their foods would have been familiar to us, the Romans also had some unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the woman ate seated on couches, while the rich men feasted together and sat down to their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there were no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built elaborate temples for their various deities, each of which was thought to be its own home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by means of rituals and festivals.
Each courtyard had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not considered very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open stalls facing the street, stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
In Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Grønland.
Despite his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Although all are Scandinavian, the nations, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ in many ways.
You might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you saw the movie National Treasure.
There's something written on the back of the statement, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is evident that early in its history, this large parchment scroll (about 30 inches by 26 inches [75 cm by 62 cm]) was rolled up for storage.
It is likely that the memorial was added as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but southern France was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading armies instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, U.S. and Free French forces liberated southern France and then marched into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together in a community.
The word civilization is taken from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also sort of defines the size of a society.
Civilization involves the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Minority communities often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognised as distinct national cultures.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak government - with the National Assembly as its only component - under the first constitution.
Parliament did not have sufficient power to levy taxes, and in the absence of a chief executive or a judiciary, it relied on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to impose taxes and duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states showed such contempt for the government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, badminton, water polo, squash, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern hemisphere, and Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of its island status, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The origin of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up camp in southwestern Taiwan and changed the rice-growing traditions of the natives, hiring Chinese laborers to work on the company's rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the plains have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work is still under way.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the parallel film era.
It is still produced today, but what is more, digital cameras are based on its aspect ratio.
The 35mm format is actually rather confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format library) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused rule of thirds that is often invoked is a simple measure of creating dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is where the lines that divide the image into a vertical and a horizontal triangle meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had amassed wealth and power, came under attack.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united Europe despite differences in language and culture.
Its sovereignty affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
The centralized authority of the church had reigned in Rome for over a thousand years, and the confluence of power and wealth led many to question whether these teachings were being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain declared war on Germany.
The policy proved successful in halting vital military and civilian supplies, although this military truce violated generally accepted international law as confirmed by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain deployed a system of coastal batteries in international waters to prevent shipping from entering the high seas, putting even neutral ships at great risk.
Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted U-boat warfare because the response was limited to this flavor.
In the 1930's, a policy of peace and isolation was the prevailing attitude of most peoples and nations.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such events from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods, each period in Chinese history or each dynasty was identified as a separate empire.
The inter-imperial period was volatile and marked by disputes within the provinces. The most famous period is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years or halfway between the Han and Jin Empires.
During these periods, there were bitter wars between the various nobles who fought for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died in battles for the highest seat in the Great Hall of Xi'an.
Many social and political factors are involved, such as the metric system, the transition from totalitarianism to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs became available to male applicants, and the most ambitious and energetic were the most successful.
The same was true of the army, for instead of rank being based on rank, it was now based on distance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave, later known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's religious leanings.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it's there.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, there is little to see or hear.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza being the largest), a small necropolis, a palace, and the Great Sphinx.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several courtyards, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "upstroke" looks like a V, and the symbol for "downstroke" is like a square with no bottom.
Up means to start at the top and push the bow, while down means to start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, the upstroke produces a soft sound, while the downstroke produces a loud, piercing sound.
Feel free to add your own meanings, but keep in mind that the printed symbols have musical value, so they should generally be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced by a group of wealthy merchants to return to Paris.
Returning to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage, they were surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave their carriage windows wide open.
One of the crowd waved the severed head of one of the king's bodyguards, who had been killed at Versailles, to the horror of the distraught queen.
The Philippine people themselves had to pay the war costs of U.S. imperialism because of territorial gains there.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States to meet much of the expenses and the interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government was funneled through the investment banks of Wall Street.
The benefits of U.S. imperialism began with the bumper crops that resulted from the long exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context in which the order was formed.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending with the Parliament around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a variety of ideas, ranging from technological constraints or technological imperatives to stronger feelings that human destiny is attacked by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely unbound by cultural and political influences, and that technology likewise "influences" societies that are natural, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that an automobile inevitably leads to a roadblock.
However, rural roads are not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, resulting in new health-care strategies to deal with crowding.
Romanticism contributed greatly to the cultural sensibilities of such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, the land shaped the individuals, and in time customs and culture developed that were specific to the land and in harmony with the community, proving far superior to random laws.
Just as Paris is famous for being the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of learning began in 400 B.C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than what the markets of Byzantium could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Western styles, on the other hand, may be 25 to 30 years behind because of the slowness of communication.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style.
Subsistence farming is farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is often a low-input, organic system that uses seeds from an ecosystem along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures unite as like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that determine a culture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of cultural communities often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most traditional ways of demonstrating the importance of socialisation is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who are neglected, unfortunate or deliberately abused.
Some precious children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases the neglect of the child resulted from the parents' rejection of the severely mentally or physically disabled child.
Stray children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild for selfish reasons.
When a child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of the animal that cares for it, such as fear of or disinterest in humans.
While project-based learning may make learning easier and more interesting, tutoring goes further.
Rather, they should be seen as a tool that supports participants to engage in an innovative learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Workstations can be both virtual and real worlds, i.e. a teacher is a kind of workstation, but it also applies to the little letter opener in Microsoft Office.
Video tutorials are built into the software and are intended to critique, invoke, and explain methods that may have been too difficult for the student to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even forced marriage.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and nurturing, but they do.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our reproductive system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a steady education, and reliable health care.
Foster homes are supposed to provide all the essentials that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass media and personal communication.
The characteristics of the Net created an additional dimension of usefulness and satisfactory access.
For example, "cognitive enhancement" and "social interaction" are identified as important drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of facial expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
The theory is that you can tell if someone is lying by interpreting the slightest resemblance correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that this ability to interpret human behavior is something possessed by animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds a new gene variant, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination push the variation back and forth between the two contaminants with each generation.
Out in the grasslands, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to obtain amino acids from certain plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and finally death.
The easiest plant sources to obtain were protein from leaves and legumes, which primates like us have difficulty digesting unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also contains high-quality protein and essential amino acids.
After all, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in tropical grasslands still do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of consciously waking up at your normal bedtime and then falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you force yourself to reset the clock during sleep, move it to the other side of the room to force yourself to go forward to turn it off.
Other alternatives involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before bed and forcing oneself to get up and urinate.
The amount of peace that a person enjoys is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is, and all individuals have the potential for finding complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has also been influenced by Mahayana teachings on love as well as numerous practices of Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of higher truth) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, the purification of energy channels by visualizing various gods, the activation of energy centers, and the creation of an information consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Less than two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive line had already been pushed back, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian border.
These plans were dashed, however, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army attacked and formed the Belarusian-Ukrainian front lines after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Armistice Agreement, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Ships are the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across oceans.
The job of the fleet has consistently been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move your people and goods, but at the same time, disrupt your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples of this was the Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines for the most part, was trying to stop these transports.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain, as they did elsewhere in Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes used such containers to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasture lands, often and sometimes tended by goatherds, who were more often than not children or adolescents, similar to the better-known herdsmen.
Wagon roads were laid in England as early as the 16th century.
The roads for horse-drawn carts were only paved with planks of timber laid side by side, but horses could still pull the carts at a higher speed and with a heavier load than on the rougher roads of the day.
Rather early, crossbeams were used to hold the tiles in place, but it gradually became apparent that the tiles would be more useful if they were topped with iron.
This was common, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of chariots.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron ones appeared.
Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man), man began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not always walk upright.
Bipedal features are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have begun walking on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
You can be kinder to the environment, become involved in the environmental movement, and even be an activist to reduce future poverty to some extent.
This is similar to the treatment of symptoms in many cases, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we should go to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's advancement in science and technology, but there are growing problems because of mankind's overpopulation and inefficient way of life.
On July 4, as soon as the Constitution had been approved by Congress, its handwritten draft was signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent to John Dunlap's printing press nearby.
That night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, called the "Dunlap Unicorn".
John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6; he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The earliest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap cannons. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of animals, called birds, became extinct.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
Their feet are webbed and webbed, they shed, and they use both hind legs to walk, just like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and such characters are referred to as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that diagnosis may not be immediately possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household products.
Check labels for instructions on first aid for that particular poison.
The term toad is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, insects that have adapted to prey on humans.
Both robins and fireflies are nest-building birds.
With about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, MS is the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests to raise a child.
These couples may choose to put together an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the parents relinquish their parental rights so that the child can be raised by other parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific approach, and this approach, in fact, drives most scientific research.
This is not the only goal, for experiments, or tests to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, questions, and observations are also guides to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers valued the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West lost touch with the philosophical and scientific roots of Greek culture.
Many biophysical and behavioral rhythms often rely heavily on internal cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Regular rhythm, which is not simply a response to external regular cues, has been documented in most organisms, including numerous bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that maintain a regular rhythm even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments that labeled either the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive hydrogen.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy nature, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of local recreation include target shooting, pole fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting herb gardens to learn about the ecosystem.
For example, travel, take photographs, and learn more about Borneo's orangutans.
Every morning people from small suburban towns drove to work and met others who were leaving work.
In this powerful transportation hub, everyone is somehow connected to, and supportive of, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this vast carbon reservoir may have dislodged the biosphere from one of the stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everybody participates in the community and everybody uses transportation.
In developing lands, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are the engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the journeys of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and how they affect each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within normal limits, and as a result, there is a degree of consistency in traffic flow that can be roughly described by mathematical calculations.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships have been defined between three main characteristics of traffic: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of a facility.
Insects were the first animals to fly, using their ability to escape predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along with their body.
This gives them a greater variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, although many believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other planets).
It seems to make sense, because we don't feel the Earth move, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, six miles at its widest.
Altogether, 20 percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but never were pyramids as large and technologically advanced as those at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the least densely populated.
In Vatican City, Italian is used for legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the empire.
Everyone in the Vatican is Catholic.
Since prehistoric times, people have known about elements such as gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be found in nature in their natural forms.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the other four aspects of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances that make up what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals, and, of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is all matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil first appeared, it was a friend to many.
Sadly, as new writing methods have become available, the pencil has been downgraded and its use diminished.
People now type messages on computer screens and never have to go near a computer.
You can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new comes on the market.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy ball up a hill, if the core re-fissions, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break apart with little or no friction.
The moon's surface is made up of rock and dust, and the outermost layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the near side.
It's thinner under the lunar ocean and thicker under the peninsula.
There may be more marl nearby because the crust is thinner.
The point of targeting is to find out what turns people on or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they acquire in adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories include Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when agents begin working for former associates, one of two changes may occur: On the one hand, they try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such a ruler finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, enforce laws, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
The other end of the line represents an unrecognizable entity that feels you have to change everything the group has done up to this point and make it your own.
At the end of the day, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Sample teams are subject to the same quality standards as normal teams, but there is a slight difference.
Visible team members are often the link to the real team closest to them.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may need to meet at different time zones that their managers in each location may not understand.
The presence of the true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why should companies want to go through the time-consuming process of learning organisation?
When all the necessary resources have been exhausted in all departments of a company, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
For this reason, a company's cooperation in overcoming an obstacle can lead to new ways of innovating to serve the interests of its customers.
For a company to become successful, its management needs to create a culture of innovation as well as information and knowledge transfer within the company.
Angel (2006) reports that companies can use the Continuum approach to significantly increase their profitability.
Neurobiological information provides material evidence for a more scientific approach to the study of intelligence, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more precise.
The link between brain chemistry and behavior is stimulating the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental function.
The advent of new technology allows us to see and study the structure and function of the brain as never before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material with which to construct models that help us to understand the workings of our mind.
AI is strongly associated with science fiction, but AI is actually a very important branch of computer science and deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and execution, the ability to respond to analyses and customer questions, as well as typing, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become separate disciplines where the emphasis is on creating solutions to real problems.
AI is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has been incorporated into many applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of all teaching, and often a teacher is more than willing to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips, where students can explore a museum exhibit, visit a zoo, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A shared field trip is also a good way to consider travel and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol. Each year the website is redesigned but old designs are kept online for support.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students' literacy skills. At the beginning, a student blog is often full of poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of a group of readers usually changes it closer.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins by seeking to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
When students blog, "they have to learn more about the world around them". The requirement to cover their readers' interests encourages students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to promote collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Responsible use of blogs "can encourage students to think critically; students can use online content to both take a stand on what others are writing and to express their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's fascinating twin-city capital, is home to many art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are pristine areas of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more illustrates what outsiders find uniquely Canadian about Ontario.
Large areas of the far north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and has unique wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The arrival of Arabs also brought Islam, which became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, European influence and colonization began when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
It is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women travelers identify themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that what they perceive as harassment may reflect cultural differences and that being chased, grabbed, and so forth, is not uncommon.
Be firm in your refusal, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not do not justify this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategically important port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan wares, such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and jewelry, all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002 the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of its streets in the valley below, except for the central part.
While Goma is relatively safe, all travel outside Goma should be carefully monitored to understand the full extent of the fighting that still rages in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for treks to Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest routes to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
Boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) can be used to travel around Goma.
Combined with the difficulty of access, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for unusual, foreign places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its fame still attracts tourists and there is an airport.
In 1990 the site was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
This was one of the stops on the PBS special The Wonders of Africa with Henry Louis Gates.
In stark contrast with other cities in the interior, it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The national park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems that support different wildlife.
The park is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is a gem among South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, it is under permanent protection and requires an entrance fee.
You may also find it helpful to purchase a "Wild Card", which gives you access to many or all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong, named after Hong Kong Island, is where most tourists visit.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have sometimes been compared to a shimmering aquamarine reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is from the Kowloon sea cliff.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban structure is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove swamp, stretching 50 miles [80 km] inland from the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Sundarbans National Park is a protected area in India.
The forests, however, are not just swamps. They contain some of the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/marsh.
Declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Group buses leave from the transport hub (on the other side of the river) during the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Small Japanese buses go to most neighborhoods. They are comfortable and safe.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 275 feet [83 m] high, the bridge is 1,250 feet [378 m] long, and the two spans are 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs office is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic pastoralists and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who made their living from hunting and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, or the "Great Indian Province", was formed when Spanish colonists encountered indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous culture and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is well-known for its polo and its top polo players.
The biggest event of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and games are also held here at other times of the year.
For convention news and where to buy tickets to a polo match, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted in most places on the island, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropical zone, where summer temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no distinct "wet" and "dry" season: the outcome is similar throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, bears and wolves should be kept at least 100 yards [100 m] away and all other wildlife 25 yards [25 m] away.
No matter how peaceful they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack a person.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep a proper distance.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that has a strong odor, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded about 1850 and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for one British destroyer, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau, a peaceful meeting in the town led to the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland lies between two harbors, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor neighborhood) borders the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour in the first-class suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes busy family beaches with a good selection of beachside shops.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", it's not a complicated beer but it's good and refreshing.
Many French wines can be purchased, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may fare better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are afraid of tap water.
For Australians, the concept of a flat white is foreign. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with a lot of cream (not icing), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from one of these are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advance warning, follow all signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Soapworms are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are occasionally found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the sea, but their main habitat is the estuary north of Rockhampton.
By making a reservation in advance, the traveler can rest assured that he will have a place to stay when he arrives.
Travel agencies often have contracts with a particular hotel, although it is also possible to book alternative accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even flights and hotels.
They can also hold the book for you if you need time to think about it or to get some documents (such as a passport) for your destination.
Please contact your travel agent for changes and other requests before checking into your hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of concert-goers choose to camp on-site, and most visitors view it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the beach, you must arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the music has stopped in the main areas, there may still be music playing in the reception areas well into the night.
Some festivals have special tents for families with young children.
Before taking a ferry across the Arctic Ocean during the winter, it is best to check the location of the pier, as the noise of sailing through ice can be irritating to sensitive people.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos often make great efforts to entice patrons to spend as much time and money as possible, often when windows and clocks are nowhere to be found and exits may be hard to find.
There are usually special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
Alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being thorough.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes is likely to encounter heavy snow, sleet, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and narrow paved roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on a flatbed truck.
During a snowstorm, it can snow so much that you are stranded.
Shade may also be limited by snow or ice on the tires.
On the other hand, icy conditions and tight roofs are the norm in many lands, and traffic flows smoothly most of the year.
A safari is perhaps Africa's main tourist attraction, and for many visitors it is the highlight of their trip.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a journey overland to view fascinating African wildlife, especially in the grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment makes them easy to spot.
Lions, tigers, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are easier to see through a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle safari", "walking safari", or simply "walking") involves a walk of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with selected events being held at other venues across Japan.
Since Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, it will be the only Asian city to host the Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of March, most coronavirus cancellation policies will not take effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to begin.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and regular tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels will let you borrow an iron and an ironing board, even when you are not in your room.
Try using a hair dryer, if available, if you do not have an iron or do not want to wear ironed socks.
Be careful not to overheat your clothes (which can cause them to shrink or even fade).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others.
In some places, one minute of boiling is sufficient; in others, more is needed.
Filters are unreliable, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal species unknown in their homeland.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in extreme cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or infect.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the worst driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway and often runs through remote rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: Such roads are characterized by steep inclines, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than those on the front and rear bumpers - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour [56 to 64 km/ hr] - and strict adherence to them is even more important.
Interestingly, though, cellular service is considerably better here than on other long sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweet bread is also quite good in Bavaria. It is rich and varied, not unlike that of its neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit trees are common, and apples are baked year-round, with cherries and plums added during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you would like to try a small but tasty pastry, try what is locally called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is basically a dish of herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
Curry is either "dry" or "wet", depending on the moisture content.
In the plains of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, whereas in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands in Indonesia, the term "Indonesian cuisine" encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes from all over the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term refers to food originating in central and eastern Java.
Javanese food is now widely prepared throughout the archipelago, with a variety of simple and tasty dishes, including peanuts, cayenne pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stems are supported on stilts that hang on either side of the crown.
They provide more stability for the button, but can be a safety feature because of the possibility of the button's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse and one of his legs is caught, the horse may pull him off on its back if he tries to run.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, rather soft, soles.
Second, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that cause the reinforcement to fall off the saddle if pulled backward, causing the rider to fall.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier rock climbing site, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a selection of large granite walls and boulders.
Its peaks offer breathtaking views, and hikers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails through its endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve running down a narrow snow-covered landscape on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Ski trips, sometimes called "ski vacations", are very popular with many enthusiasts, and vacations are organized around the sport of skiing in certain places.
The idea of skiing is very old, with cave paintings depicting skiers dating back as far as 5000 B.C.
The use of bronze as a dagger dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was formed by Norwegians in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: Also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or simply skiing.
This is a form of skiing that generally does not involve alpine or mountain climbing, the latter of which requires steeper slopes and the use of much stiffer skis and ski boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover somewhat more ground than if you were walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, you would have to go through a lot of passport and visa checks when travelling between many countries.
The Schengen area works very much like a single country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, you can still cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques; some tax authorities define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has a geographical bias, as age restrictions may be lower in some places such as North America compared to Europe.
Craft products could be classified as avant-garde, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many within other occupational classes.
Despite long-standing traditions, not all Sami farmed reindeer on a large scale. Rather, they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, Samaland.
The term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Roma, but is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about what Roma are.
If a travel advisory is issued in the country to which you are travelling, this may affect your sickness or accident insurance.
It would also be good to seek advice from other governments, but their advice is limited to their own citizens.
For example, conditions may be different for U.S. citizens in the Middle East than for Europeans and Arabs.
Opinions are simply brief summaries of the political situation in a particular country.
The opinions often expressed are often superficial, exhaustive, and overly simplistic when compared with more detailed information available elsewhere.
A severe storm is a dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Tornadoes can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, terrain, and atmosphere.
Thunderstorms, hail, torrential rains, and wildfires are examples and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include typhoons, hurricanes, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of severe weather in the area, as it may affect their travel plans.
All who wish to visit a country classified as a target area must undergo special training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment course" will probably turn up the address of a nearby business.
Usually, all the subjects discussed here are covered in a course and usually by on-the-job training.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training and in some cases weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about life in the rurals, but not so many publications about war zones.
Travellers who view sexuality abroad must ensure that you have a valid identity card before returning home.
The willingness of the authorities to issue passports where the gender is not specified (X) or documents authorising the name and gender requested is mixed.
The willingness of governments in other lands to accept these documents varies just as much.
