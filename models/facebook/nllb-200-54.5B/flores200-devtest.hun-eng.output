Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already popular, but it also reveals details that fossils usually do not reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut brown above and pale or orange to the sides.
The discovery may also provide insight into the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed tongue, called a stalk, but have the other characteristics of feathers - feather fibers and fins - researchers have concluded that the stalks likely evolved later than that.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but for temperature control or to attract attention. The researchers concluded that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern indicates adult feathers, not those of a chick.
The researchers speculated that although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern suggested adult plumage, not juvenile plumage.

Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the additional eradication experiment were closely monitored by game wardens as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness assessed.
The NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sport Federation (NSW) have worked together to recruit trained volunteers for the Shooting Sport Federation's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the NPWS Parks Conservation and Heritage Office, the four shooters selected for the first launch operation have undergone extensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the cancellation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The intermittent violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
"The department responded by calling the delay in Apple's announcement "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (19:19 GMT Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands' disaster management office, there are no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no tsunami warning.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six others are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later substituted for an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he started researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that injecting a hormone could accelerate the development of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremity. Luna was my first manager. Luna passed away on a two-month-old night. She was very unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman".
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels remarked, "Luna was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place now".""
Ahead of the 2010 federal election, among 1,400 people surveyed, the proportion who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of the voters agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the spectrum, 29% of those polled thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold-medal-winning swimmer had qualified for the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints raised doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because it's banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the largest suppliers of water to Earth, along with the organic materials that make up proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of the Earth, after comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
Some say he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel every year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport facilities, surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and P+R car parks will not be available.
Fears over the lack of transportation raised the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported the appearance of a new species that resulted from the crossing of the native medium-sized ground finch (Geospiza fortis) with an introduced species, the large cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even on a small scale.
It can be drawn into thin, easily twisted and twisted wire. It also allows forging or rolling into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals, so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images of "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH, and you can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons formed by electron donation (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the transmission and transmits it back to earth almost instantly.
Scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has made incredible changes in the world, and the biggest thing it's done is make transportation much easier and much faster.
It brought us the train, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept, a special activity that all cats follow, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females tend to bond better with each other, being a big sister-daughter family.
Surprisingly, packs of lions behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that behave like lions (but not like other big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is one of four big cats, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion but is more like a sentence of gruntingly shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can catch them, they will eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the scent of animals, sniffing them out on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark because of their night vision and stealth, and they hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it crosses a mountain or a river, or if it moves to a new island and cannot easily get back), it often finds itself in a different environment from before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of their time, so they weren't afraid of anything except another mosasaur.
Its long jaws have more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an additional row on the roof of its mouth, ensuring that nothing gets past it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet may have included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
At the same time, it attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a snack called nutmeg.
The other difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together, where they ate side by side and talked.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a temple, which they viewed as the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and their priests and tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special shrine to the deity.
Because of the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Cooking was done by the women in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was an expensive commodity.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed in many ways.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map recorded on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down".
Although the identity of its writer is uncertain, it is known that soon after its completion, the large (29 1/4 inches long by 24 1/2 inches wide) parchment document was rolled up and stored.
So it's likely that the mark was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared within a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin words civilis, civis, and civitas, meaning citizen, citizen, or city or city-state.
City-states are the forerunners of nations, and civilized wellness involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first established a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and no national executive or judicial branch, so it relied on often reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to overrule tax laws or interstate tariffs.
Changes to the Basic Law required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states did not take the central government seriously enough to have their representatives often absent themselves from meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's seventh-largest island!
"Japan is often called an ""archipelago"" from a geographical point of view due to the grouping of islands".
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name - Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed native grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main parts, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog film era.
It's still in production today, but what's important is that its scale has been taken over by the image sensor format of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format actually means, somewhat confusingly, 36 m wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio (after division by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) of this format can therefore be set to 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) match or approach this aspect ratio.
Often misused and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective placement of the main subject is the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
At that time in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether its basic teachings were being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated general international law as expressed in several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job in New York City with the Edison Company.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor.
Ancient China had a peculiar way of representing different eras: each era and each ruling family in Chinese history was a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the struggle for supremacy in the Xi'an palace.
There's a lot of social and political implications of the decimal system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and a belief in the country of the people rather than a sovereign ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to outcompete the others.
The same was true of the military, for instead of rank in the army being determined by class, it was now based on ability.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Mohammed showed a deep interest in things beyond the worldly life. He regularly went to a cave on the mountain of "Noor" (light), which became known as "Hira", a place of meditation".
It's the cave itself that has stood the test of time and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, a world barely seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramids built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built for Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "pull up" sign is V-shaped, and the "pull down" sign looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom.
Upward means start at the tip and press the bow, downward means start at the frog (where your hand rests on the bow) and pull the bow.
"Pulling ""up"" generally produces a softer sound, while pulling ""down"" is stronger and more definite".
Feel free to mark your notes in pencil, but remember that the printed dashes are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a car surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw open the windows of their carriage.
Suddenly, before the terrified queen's eyes, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
U.S. imperialism's war expenditure to conquer the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
To cover much of the cost, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial government, and the bonds flowed to Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits that came from the prolonged exploitation of the people of the Philippines were the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the Order.
The era of the events is generally referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism, in practice, includes a wide range of ideas, from the insistence on technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that, on the other hand, technology has ""effects"" on societies, and that these effects are inherent rather than socially conditioned".
For example, there is a view that the automobile necessarily leads to improved roads.
However, a nationwide road network was not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
At the same time, mass car ownership leads to high rates of road accidents, which stimulates the development of new medical techniques to heal injured bodies.
Much of Romanticism was cultural determinism and drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, the customs and culture associated with a given geographic location, which were consistent with the location of the community, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders rejected dubious gifts, such as silks and spices, which they valued more highly than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style flourished from the 10th to the 11th century and reached its peak in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine, Eastern culture.
However, due to slow communication methods, styles in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
One of the biggest developments as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming which produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses conserved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques common in the ecoregion to maximize yield.
Throughout history most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop self-esteem.
Subcultures may be characterized by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership with a recognizable symbol system of style, which includes fashion, behavior patterns, and use of slang.
One of the most common ways of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to point to the few unfortunate examples of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or premeditated abuse, failed to socialize with adults as they grew up.
Such children are called feral or unmanageable. Some feral children were separated by humans (often their own parents). In some cases the abandonment of the child was parental rejection due to the child's severe intellectual or physical impairment.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised with animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a child living in the wild with physical limitations will almost certainly adopt the behavioral patterns of his animal caretaker, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to those engaged in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"Scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of ""scaffolding"", but also the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office".
Virtual scaffolding has been incorporated into the software, which is designed to challenge, promptly question and explain procedures that would have challenged the learner to complete the task independently.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
Never should a child be allowed to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, and yet it happens.
We see foster care as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care program is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and a reliable health care system.
Orphanages must provide all the necessities that are missing from the former home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of usage and satisfaction patterns.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also new motivational dimensions in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience reaction to Internet sites".
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Especially when it is claimed that some people can correctly tell when someone is lying by certain facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", pointed out that people with brain damage who cannot understand speech are very good at detecting sincerity.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic variation comes in two varieties: latent and expressed.
Mutation provides the opportunity for new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
The mixing of segregation and recombination, the back-and-forth variation between the two monetary bases in every generation.
Out on the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
What's more, there are serious consequences when this is not met: growth depression, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it would not be surprising if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the same way modern chimpanzees do on the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up from a normal sleep cycle and falling back to sleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring about a state of alertness without completely waking you up.
If you reset the clock in your sleep, move it to the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to urinate at night.
The amount of inner peace a person has is in contrast with the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force, and each person has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques derived from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its principles, a path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, the visualization of multiple deities to clear energy channels, activate the chakras and enlighten consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. At the end of the war, differences in systems, methods, and cultures led the countries to clash.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
For the next 40 years, proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to retreat through the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure the country's ability to move people and goods while impeding the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for their readily available milk as well as for their hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent goatherds, similar to the more widely known herders.
Trackways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although tracks consisted only of parallel poles, they allowed horses to pull faster and with greater loads than on the relatively few bumpy roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used early enough to hold the track in place, but it was slowly realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became an everyday practice, but the iron took better advantage of the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began walking on two legs about two million years ago, at the same time as Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, usually did not walk upright.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering of the future.
In many cases, this is like treating a symptom, but if we want something more than a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems of overpopulation and mankind's luxurious life-style have increased.
After its introduction to Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary of state, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now called "Dunlap prints".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and the copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that still exist today are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and that is birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Birds are similar to dinosaurs in many other ways.
They have scaly, clawed feet, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits, or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common for an immediate diagnosis.
The surest sign of internal poisoning is an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term beetle is officially used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to prey on humans.
Both robber bugs and bed bugs are nest-builders, i.e. they are capable of nesting or using the structure.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may even decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method, which is essentially the basis of most scientific research.
But it's not just that. It's experimentation, and an experiment is a test to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions and to observe, which also helps in scientific research.
Scholars and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of the Greek language, the West cut itself off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observable in physiology and human behaviour are in most cases highly dependent on the occurrence and production of endogenous cycles during the biological cycle.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have periodic rhythms that are not mere responses to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps cycling freely, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were performed in which the phage DNA was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the importance of the genetic material and whether the cells involved are germ cells or not.
Only germline mutations can be inherited by children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in and enjoy natural sites, including flora and fauna.
On-site programs include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours, and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and getting to know Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people from small towns in the countryside drive to work and pass by those who work in the area they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is connected to everyone else in some way and supports a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that these massive emissions of carbon dioxide knocked the biosphere out of the stable state that had supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone has a complaint about them.
Similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in developed lands.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus, traffic flows generally have a reasonable consistency and can be mathematically approximated.
In order to better visualize traffic flows, three main characteristics have been correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the design, construction and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and damselflies cannot fold their hind wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you can't feel the Earth rotating, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second-longest river on Earth, with a flow more than eight times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in places.
Twenty percent of the rivers flowing into the oceans originate in the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and engineering excellence of the Giza pyramids.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by monuments built by their ancestors well over a millennium earlier.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest and least populous independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of those working in the state, while Latin is used mostly in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about such basic elements as gold, silver, and copper because they are all found in nature in raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, thought that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which are earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he thought these would become the new materials we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium, potassium and elements like that are considered metals, and of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
Certain alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil appeared, it did a lot of good for a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as newer writing systems have evolved, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and used less.
People write messages on computer screens these days and never go near a mountaintop.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when they come up with something new.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to smash together many protons and neutrons of an atomic nucleus.
Like pushing a heavy car up a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they sometimes split apart with little impact or even by themselves.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner below the mare and thicker below the plateau.
There may be more black rock nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized during adulthood.
These theories explore what makes certain people want to do the things they do and what in their environment makes them want to do or not do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can develop when leaders start managing their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when they try to 'stay one of the guys' (or girls)".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable person who feels the need to change everything the group creates and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are measured by the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons for the immediate physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of the virtual team.
"The ""invisible team"" is the leadership team to whom the members report. The invisible team sets the standard for the members".
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization?
When all available resources in an organization's functional departments are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the collaborative process of overcoming barriers results in a new innovative process within the organization to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management needs to create a culture of innovation and of shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports what scientists have observed.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and alter some mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material that we can use to build simulation models to understand what's going on in our minds.
Despite having a strong sci-fi connotation, AI is actually a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, management, planning and scheduling, responsiveness to customer diagnosis and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become disciplines in their own right that focus on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in the software of many home computers and video games.
Class trips are a big part of every classroom.Teachers often and happily take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology allows for virtual field trips, so students can go to see art in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire any piece of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a class trip experience virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capitol, and they redesign the website every year, but as a memorial, they also keep the old versions online.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the appearance of the audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger believes that in order to avoid criticism, developing writing skills is key.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". Keeping the audience interested encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to significantly extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; actively responding to material on the Internet can help students to determine their attitude towards the writing of others" and their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has many art galleries and museums that show us Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka.
These, along with many other things, portray Ontario as genuinely Canadian to foreigners.
To the north are vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic fact that surprises many people is that there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them and made significant inroads in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female travellers, regardless of their marital status, are advised to identify themselves as married.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's still not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century C.E. and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and then abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders renamed it Casablanca and established a trading post.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tagines, tiles, leather goods, hookahs and all sorts of trinkets, but everything here is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is important to know about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before visiting outside Goma.
The town is a base for climbing Nyragongo volcano and is one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
For transport within Goma, boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) can be used.
Associated with its relative isolation, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its fame has given it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS series "African Wonders of the World".
In sharp contrast with the rest of the country, the city has an Arab rather than an African atmosphere.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to a different species.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and the flagship of the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
As in all South African national parks, there is a conservation fee and an entrance fee.
"It may also be useful to purchase a ""Wild Card"" card, which gives access to either selected South African parks or all South African national parks".
Named after Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong is a focal point for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is like a glittering colonnade, enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best possible view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The urban area of Hong Kong Island is largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the English colonists occupied, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are also some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is water/wetland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now estimated to contain 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese beach buses, which are comfortable and have a large capacity.
One-way taxis are a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting Oiapoque, Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], are 1,200 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indians", came into being as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonizing phase that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
At other times of the year, less prestigious competitions and matches can also be viewed here.
For championship news and to purchase tickets for polo matches, visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), equivalent in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite FIC West.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere in and around the islands and can often be paid for with Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and U.S. currency may still be accepted.
It's almost impossible to change Falklands currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where temperatures often exceed 30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly wet or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to human contact, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The Park Service recommends that you stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife.
As docile as they may seem, they can be attacked by bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal.
Dozens of visitors a year are injured because they didn't keep their distance.
It is also important to know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring in strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for one British battleship, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful gathering in the town during the Mau movement's struggle for independence.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is separated by two harbors.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a variety of shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'".
You can get a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of a 'flat white' coffee - the short black is called an 'espresso', the cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the juices are expensive but of high quality.
There are many visitors to the reef all year round, and injuries resulting from this are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of authorities, follow signs, and heed safety warnings.
Since 1770, box jellyfish have been found between October and April near beaches and estuaries, and occasionally elsewhere at these times.
Sharks occasionally attack humans, but most are afraid of humans and prefer to stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have special offers with certain hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as a campsite.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even a combination of airfare and accommodation.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) needed for your destination.
Any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most even consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the concert on the main stage has ended, there may be areas of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, watch the position of your cabin, as sailing through the ice can make terrible noise for those who are too close.
St. Petersburg tours include sightseeing.Passengers on ships are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests happy and in the room.
However, drunkenness impairs one's judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Drivers must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures at all high altitudes or on mountain passes.
Ice and snow roads have low friction and cannot be driven on as bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to cause traffic jams.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or blowing snow, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows smoothly year-round.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and an outstanding experience for visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips overland to view the fascinating wildlife of Africa, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close enough to cars to be observed with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "excursion safari" or "walking safari") consists of a hike of a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
The cancellation terms vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation terms do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that event tickets will generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with ticket prices typically around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes helps dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Care should be taken not to allow the tissue to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others more time is needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have encountered at home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, and spread poison or infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free purchases refer to the purchase of products at certain locations free of taxes and duties.
Travellers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which often traverses isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open for steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and following stages - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is essential.
Interestingly, though, the signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are very good, and Bavaria has a fairly rich and varied baking tradition, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked year-round, and cherries and plums are baked in summer.
However, many German baked goods contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts, and the more popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but hearty pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a herb- and spice-based dish made with meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be ""dry"" or ""soupy"" depending on how much liquid it contains".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used to make curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a huge variety of cuisines from all over the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term most often refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple spicy dishes dominated by the Javanese flavors of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut), and various aromatic spices.
The rider's legs are supported by stirrups that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns as the rider's foot may get caught.
If the horse throws the rider, but the leg gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him if he continues to ride.
For one thing, most competitors wear flat, narrow-toed riding boots with heels.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, are fitted with safety bars that allow the harness to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back while falling.
The Cochamó Valley is a prominent mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and fissures.
From the summits of these mountains, the view is breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes on the walls of endless possibility.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, including downhill skiing on snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to the foot.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, its fans are sometimes referred to as "ski lovers" and plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking: also called backcountry skiing, hiking, or ski touring.
It is related to but not usually associated with alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
Interpret the ski trail as if it were a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover more distance than on foot - but you will rarely reach the speed needed for cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through several visa applications and passport controls.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area operates somewhat like a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you will normally not need to pass through any additional passport control when crossing borders.
Similarly, a Schengen visa eliminates the need to exchange separate visas in each Schengen Member State, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of what manufactured objects are antiques; some tax authorities define antiques as objects more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, with some places having a lower age limit than Europe, such as North America.
Craft products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding was - and still is - an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is important to many people in other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they made a living from fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami town of Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you intend to visit is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also ask other governments for advice, but those governments tailor their advice to their own citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens from the Middle East may be treated differently by Europeans and Arabs.
Fact sheets are simply brief summaries of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often brief, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social disruption or even loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and has several types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, including thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, hailstorms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in the area, as this may affect their travel plans.
If you are planning to visit a country that is a war zone, you may benefit from professional training.
If you search the Internet for the words "hostile environment training", you'll probably get the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts two to five days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.

Rip currents are the returning currents of waves that break away from the shore, often at a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return current is compressed at some deeper sections and a fast current in deep water can develop there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs much earlier than culture shock (shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and may be more severe.

In remote areas where there is no cell service, a satellite phone may be the only solution.
Satellite phones do not generally replace mobile phones, as a phone call requires you to be outdoors with an unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is frequently used for navigation, including pleasure boating, and expeditions where data and voice communications are required.
Your local telephone operator can give you more information on how to connect to the service.
An increasingly popular option is to take a so-called gap year to travel and study.

Participation in these educational programmes is normally subject to a fee.
"Finland is a great destination for boating. The ""Land of a Thousand Lakes"" also has thousands of small islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos".
On islands and lakes, a yacht may not be necessary.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland and every seventh or eighth person owns a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most major Baltic Sea routes include a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and spend the night on board.

As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.

For some, a partial understanding of the workings of aircraft and the events of flight can help overcome fears rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay well for speedy delivery, and time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or urgent repairs to spare parts.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies there were problems.
If goods were shipped by air freight, some routes might take days to unload and clear customs.

The obvious way to fly first or business class is to fork over a fat stack of bills for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the normal fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats between points A and B.
Airlines know that some passengers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic plagued by ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclamation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.

Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
