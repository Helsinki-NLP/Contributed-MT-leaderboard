This suggests that some dinosaurs may have had lungs, a theory that has been heavily debated, but which cannot be traced back to the dinosaur lineage.
According to folklore, the animal's fur resembles chestnut feathers on the upper part of the body, with the lower part of the tail feathers or hairy feathers.
The theory also focuses on the evolution of the behaviour of birds.

Critics pointed out that even though the dinosaur was a juvenile, its plumage gave evidence of maturity, not old age.
