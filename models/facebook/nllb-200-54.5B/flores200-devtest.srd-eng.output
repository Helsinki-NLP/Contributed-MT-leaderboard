This not only confirms that dinosaurs at least had feathers, a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional composition.
Scientists say the feathers were brown above with a yellow or orange underside.
The discovery also shows the evolution of feathers in bats.
Because dinosaur fins do not have a highly developed tail, but have other fin parts - barbels and whiskers - researchers reasoned that the tail must have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult rather than juvenile feathers.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult rather than juvenile plumage.
A car bomb explodes at a police base in Gaziantep, Turkey, early this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The director of the office said that ten of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a suspected Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun behaved by the same basic principles as all the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by luminosity and rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic fields.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made with the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Milky Way galaxy.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the variant was "very problematic and dangerous because of the very high mortality".

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voter isolates himself in a booth, places a pre-printed sheet of paper announcing the choice inside an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in a ballot box and signs the electoral roll.

Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes with strong supervision, following specific procedures.

Other topics discussed appear to have included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement when the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
The shooters of the supplemental disinfestation control trial would be closely supervised by park rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, volunteer qualified shooters were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's cash programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the park's conservation and heritage director with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in before a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in Ledamine.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, which had been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had received reports of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 overheating incidents, which the company characterized as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "very unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Wednesday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage was reported nationwide.
So far, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has issued no tsunami warnings.
A former Philippine police officer takes Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A number of hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly as well as the Filipino photographers, were released.
Later photographers took the place of a lady "who needed the bathroom. In Mendoza they shot her.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a nurse and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying early childbirth in her spare time.
His research showed that by administering a hormone, it would accelerate the development of the liver.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two flight recorder 'black boxes'.
Former wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first principal. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe crazier...I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of people surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of people surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her injuries her form was in doubt.
She was unable to take pain medication, as it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software since early February and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been sources of water transport to earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, in particular how the Earth formed, from the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor in January and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He defined voices as "political tools and machines".
He is rumored to be considering running for president in 2016.
Nextgen is a system that the FAA claims would allow the aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport has been activated and surface trains will not sign at Wembley, and parking and change facilities are not available on the surface.
Concerns about lack of transportation led to the possibility of playing the game behind closed doors, away from the teams' fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new genus of finches on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new genus evolved in only two generations, although it was believed that this process would have taken much longer, due to selection between an endemic Darwin's weevil, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus weevil, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes; it can be made into very small objects.
It can be inserted into a fine wire, which can be twisted and twisted.
It can be worked very fine, and embedded in other metals, so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the total hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Rub the items together and then, with clean hands, scoop them into a bowl.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will change and form a crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women bathed together.
When you send to anyone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and returns it almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere blocks light and heat.
It takes a large rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
We took the train, the car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized felids that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging kittens) that eat other numerous prey such as bobcats, rodents, tilichertas, and skunks.
The secret of their success is the concept of the nest, a special function that each feline performs that saves it from competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
The cohorts consist of one to three adult male relatives, with a maximum of thirty females and offspring.
The women tend to be related to each other, forming a large extended family of sisters and daughters.
The claws of lions function similarly to those of wolves or dogs, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as highly lethal to prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make very long jumps and push with a force five times that of a man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These three felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of murmured and shouted words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals, such as guinea pigs, deer, rodents, and squirrels, and most of the animals it hunts are smaller than that.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and catch prey animals from the forest, burrowing into the ground where they have fallen.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision, and also move very stealthily.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population from which it came (such as moving to a mountainside or a river, or moving to a new island so it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from where it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need more than new qualities or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to look more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot mutate the same way.
This process is called speciation, which precisely indicates the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
Plants are the building blocks of our homes, livestock, and much of our food. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of the time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its jaws are equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with others in the palate, meaning that there was no escape for anything that blocked that path.
It is not known for certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included frogs, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
In addition, it attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been a problem for it.
While most of their jewellery would be known to us, the Romans had their share of curious and rare festive objects, including kites, parrots, corrobakes and a species of rodent called the ghiru.
Another difference was that while poor people and women sat together in a circle, the rich liked to sit together in a circle.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no buckwheat, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians dedicated a major temple to each of their gods, which they considered to be the god's house.
The people would offer sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods with rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Occasionally special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine in honor of the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was less important.
Much of a Jewish family's life was spent abroad.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open fireplaces, and the booty was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive to burn.
Greenland was settled in stages; in Norse tales, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while sailing further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But aside from this discovery, Eskimo tribes had already been living there for a long time.
As each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in people, goods, customs and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Knight Templar, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is untrue; when Bellechi finds something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the other side of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although we do not know with certainty who wrote it, it is known that initially, the document's large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it may appear that the annotation was only added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that encompasses a relatively large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and has been variously defined as the size of a society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization's culture requires a collective identity from one generation to the next, a lasting cultural imprint, and honest dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had lost all power to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
It also had no authority to override interstate tax and tariff laws.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be ratified and the states had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to Japan's large number of islands, it is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing through named the island Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in the aboriginal wheat production practices and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western half of Taiwan and parts of the northern coastline and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the outer walls of the complex have been re-painted to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
Since 1976, the thirtieth anniversary of Machu Picchu has been celebrated and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still-image photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format by the end of the analog film period.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratios are inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, somewhat imprecise, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the best location on the main subject is the intersection of lines that cut the image into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was being challenged.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power hurt everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth usually alleviates suffering and that church endowments exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved successful, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, as the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering neutral shipping as well.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its extensive undersea warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism dominated the views of most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China was unique in displaying distinct time periods; each phase of China or era in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a troubled age of divided provinces, the best known of these periods being the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was fierce warfare between various nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history as tens of thousands of people died fighting for control of the upper floors of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
The same holds true for the army as military ranks instead of being based on class, as they are based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside of worldly life. He used to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira" in the Mount of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived over the years, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual habits.
Perched atop a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find unless one knows of its existence. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Nothing of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the pharaoh's death.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of Death contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arch" sign looks like a V and the "lower arch" sign looks like a paper clip or a square that has lost its bottom edge.
High means you must start from the tip and load the bow, and low means you must start from the bowstring (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and load the bow.
A high-pitched bow usually produces a softer sound, while a low-pitched bow is louder and more decided.
Feel free to mark your own signs with a pencil, but remember that printed bow signs are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to respect them.
King Louis XVI fled, but Queen Marie Antoinette, the children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Lisette, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a group of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The flood of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point a member of the household blew the head off a dead guard at Versailles in front of the startled queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay for most of their expenses, and interest on bonds was raised on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Obviously, the superprofits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute a springboard for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The age in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and were in fact followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from the technology push or technological imperative to a narrower sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that propagates cultural or political influence, and that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are emergent, rather than conditioned by society.
For example, one could say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of addictions.
However, a national road network is not suitable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to minimise the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to treat physical injuries to people.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and in the course of time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, since they were in harmony with the place and society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
Its fortunes declined during the twentieth century as the Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were valued far above what the Byzantine market could offer.
It was then that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the time being the use of buttons as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture geared towards producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using preserved seeds grown in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically most farmers were employed in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who see themselves as set apart from society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, caste, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or combined.
Members of a subculture often signal membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashions, customs, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is drawing on the unfortunate few cases of children who, due to neglect or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
Some feral children have been abandoned by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases this abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a severe physical and mental disability.
Aggressive children may have had a severe experience of child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are thought to have been carried off by animals; some are said to have lived in the forest on their own.
When weighed against all non-human animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of a carnivore, such as fear or indifference for humans.
While a learning-based design would make it easier and more engaging, the framework takes a step back.
The framework is not a learning method but rather a support tool for individuals who are in the midst of a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, a mast is a form of scoring but so is the head of the stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is provided within the program and is meant to question, advise and explain procedures that might have been cumbersome for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse and neglect to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is anything but nurturing, caring and nurturing, but it is.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs of the household from which the child was taken.
The Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication.
The marked characteristics of the Internet lead to other dimensions by speaking of a goal based on uses and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal branding"" and ""continuous relationship"" were also noted as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying visitors' reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can note whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his publication The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are also unable to ascertain the truth carefully.
It also suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals other than domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: recessive and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Insertion and recombination mix and recombine variation between groups at each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet the demand for amino acids from readily available resources in plants.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most directly accessible plant resources would have been the readily available proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates to digest without us taking them.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, wood ants, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a large amount of proteins containing all the amino acids they need.
After all, we wouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" a bit like chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of gradually falling asleep during your normal sleep period and returning to sleep shortly thereafter (10.60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a more or less silent alarm to bring yourself back to consciousness without completely waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock when you are asleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to study it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing one to weigh oneself before urinating.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension one has in body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force present. Each person has a potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded from the Mahayana path of love and a variety of Indian yoga techniques.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and incantations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga deity. With the worship of various deities the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was an ally in World War II, playing off the Soviet Union's cooperation with the United States, and by the end of the war the clash of systems, technology, and culture had brought the countries to the brink of war.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and saw actual fighting, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to regroup and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were already obsolete at night, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most convenient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War I. The Americans were attempting to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, Germany's navy, using mostly U-boats, was closing in on this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to rely on them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and stone.
Domestic goats were generally herded in packs that grazed on hayfields or other pasture areas, often attended by caretakers who were already increasingly small, similar to the better-known sheep herders; these methods of herding are still used today.
Rolls had been made in England since the 16th century.
Although the pulleys were simply parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to pull them for higher speeds and to pull larger loads than in the slightly rougher tracks of the time.
The tracks were soon added to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were topped with an iron girder.
This had become common practice, but the iron caused more wear than the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first all-iron wheels were introduced.
The earliest known transport is on foot, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) stage.
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not routinely walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally consciously, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is only a symptomatic treatment, in most cases. However, if we do not want a temporary solution only, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is quite understandable that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humans.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then shipped a few blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, to be read to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap folios are the earliest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Most paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and is alive today.
Many people do not think of these as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are a number of features of the pylons that still make them dinosaur-like.
They have webbed feet, lay eggs, and can walk on two legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on information processing that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers refer to binary digits - or bits, to use the language of computers.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to allow rapid diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for precise first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The word babballoti is used by etymologists in a formal sense for this group of snakes.
This word comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are snakes adapted to parasitize humans.
Both mouthbrooders and bed bugs nest, adapting to live there or in the homes of their hosts.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MI.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of the child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their daughter.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take custody of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works, through the scientific method, which drives most scientific inquiry.
So it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, including asking questions and observing during scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself excluded from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external stimuli, have been documented for a wide range of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining regulatory organs that will follow periods of free-running cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first major experiments to show that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by irradiating either the DNA in the liver with radioactive phosphorus or the liver protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are in the germline.
Only changes in cells in the germline can be passed on to offspring, while changes elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscapes, plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, whale watching, visits to parks, and study of ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small towns in the countryside drive to work and are passed by others who have their work destination in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone is connected in some way to, and supports, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Current science indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Most people are concerned about transportation systems.
Similar levels of concern about water quality or collapsing bridges are unlikely in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate these issues, why do they have problems every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they may have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly coherent scale; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three characteristics: 1) flow, 2) density and 3) velocity.
These relationships aid in infrastructure planning, design, and operations.
Snakes were the first animals to learn to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most snakes have the advantage of being able to fold their wings away from their body.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only snakes that cannot flap their wings are flies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as the other stars).
This seems to make sense, since the Earth does not appear to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as much as six miles wide.
About 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by hundreds of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and construction excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were appalled by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a hundred years old.
The population of Vatican City is just over 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the civil service while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic elements such as gold, silver, copper since antiquity, because these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they changed into other substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, although there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so very small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people as it got older.
Unfortunately, as other methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to minor status and uses.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to have a pen nearby.
One only wonders what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Re-splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no pushing.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km on the non-visible side.
It is thinner below the seas and thicker below the mountains.
There should have been more mares on the visible side because the crust is thinner and it was easier for the lava to sink to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes or attracts passionate people.
These theories assume that people have needs and/or desires that have been internalized by growing into adulthood.
These theories focus on what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment lead them to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may be worse when managers begin to turn on former colleagues: One end of the scale tends to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making poor decisions, executing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning competencies, and assigning responsibilities.
At the other end of the scale, one changes into an unknown person who thinks he must change everything the team has done and must do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in fights between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional squad members, as squads can be assembled according to time zones that may not be understood by the local administration.
The presence of a real "invisible team" as well (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing organizational learning? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a consequence, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create both a culture of innovation and organizational shared knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum perspective as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus narrowing the research area and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been believed that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important part of computing, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research is concerned with building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Symptoms include control, planning and programming, responsiveness to diagnosis and client requests, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a large part of each class. Often a teacher would like to take students to places where travel by mail is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips, where students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire works of art sitting with the class.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with upcoming classes.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin the blogging experience with superficial grammar and spelling, the presence of a general audience changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers begin to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".[3] The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to be curious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond a traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writing while also developing their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's stylish, bilingual capital city and features a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
The extreme south is home to Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more elevate Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wasteland.
For a startling population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, especially to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (at least one that does not look too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stand firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to assert your position (cultural differences or not, it doesn't work!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dari I-Badya and renamed it Casablanca after the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive shopping destinations in Morocco.
Outside the old Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, stoneware, hookah, and a wide range of snacks, but it is mostly for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far north of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city, especially its downtown.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city would have to be studied to ascertain the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for trekking to Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest gorilla trekking in Africa.
Boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) can be hired to move around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for exotic and expansive lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, though its reputation as a tourist attraction has improved, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main covers during the PBS special of Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities, which are more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered the most important of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, there is daily maintenance and entrance fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous for one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selected parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a popular tourist destination.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape have been compared to a bright line graph that is evident thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for golden Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching for 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Yet the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 red deer in the area.
Postcards leave from the inter-district station (near the river) during the day, although most, particularly those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6.30 and 7.30.
As inter-district postcards are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese post offices, which are comfortable and solid.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge was scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian toll booths were expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the region of other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by farming, hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formally called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadores with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at Christmas on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West department store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
In the Faroe Islands credit cards may not be accepted, as British and U.S. currencies are accepted; check with merchants beforehand to determine which is an acceptable method of payment.
It is no longer possible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is below the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures commonly exceed 30 °C (86 °F).
Winters can be unseasonably cold: temperatures can occasionally drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific seasons as "dangerous" and "dry": the amount of water remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are dependent on humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other animals!
No matter how large they may appear, bison, elk, deer, bears and all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep the proper distance. These beasts are large, aggressive and can be dangerous, so leave them alone.
In addition, you should be aware that strawberries attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing coarse clothing that draws straw and keeps the field clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of the famous 1889 naval confrontation when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is sandwiched between two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor district) open to the Pacific Ocean and extend from Baja Longa on the north end to Devemport on the south end.
They are mostly safe sandy beaches for swimming, and are mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive marinas are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale neighbourhoods of Lower Mission and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are often busy family beaches with luxury shops on the seafront.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but pale and fresh. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
Local tap water is safe and safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are not careful.
For Australians, the idea of a 'long black' coffee is foreign: a short black is "espresso", the cappuccino is taken with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the level of Belgium's, and the pastries are expensive but very good.
Many coral reef tours take place throughout the year and strobes due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish breeds near marinas and river estuaries from January to April in the 1770s, although they are occasionally found outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans; most sharks are shy of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, since for them it would be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined travel/hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer and you need time to get documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests, if any, must be made in advance to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, with most attendees considering it a key part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action than you have to go slow to find a place to camp close to the music.
He mentions that while the music on the main stages may be muted, there may be sections of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are rowing in the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, as running through the ice creates a very scary sound for the people most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check terms).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to make their patrons spend as much time and money as possible; windows and clocks are usually absent and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks and entertainment, to keep patrons happy and inside the premises.
Some locals offer free booze at the casino, however, drunkenness is rampant and all good gamblers know the importance of staying healthy.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, sleet, and freezing temperatures.
In gravel and snow races, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on smooth asphalt.
During the snowy seasons, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to block you.
Visibility may be limited by wind shear or condensation or glare from car windows.
On the other hand, sunny and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues more or less uninterrupted throughout the year.
Wildlife safaris are the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular time for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a tour of the mainland to see the enchantment of African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the vehicles and the standard crew will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes feared and are best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking, bushwalking,
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not apply to the 2020 Trials, for which the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Lunch and dinner may be provided by some hotels, although they are not provided in the room.
If you don't have a lunch box or don't feel like wearing lunch boxes, you can try using a napkin holder, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the bread get too hot (which can scorch it or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effect, and if you should have any doubts, you should consider buying the water in well-sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar parasitic animals in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritations or, in the worst case, cause allergies, spread easily or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people do not usually present as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the deadliest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often driving through isolated forested terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: they're all bumpy, narrow lanes and hairpin bends.
It is known that established speed limits are lower than on the forward and aft sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and vigorous compliance with these is even more important than the reverse.
Curiously, cell phone service here is much stronger than in many other sections of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania backcountry.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, with apple desserts available year-round, and plum and cherry desserts available in the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular pies go especially well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want smaller but rich pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, iodine is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the eastern subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
As widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a variety of spicy dishes, the most common spices preferred by Javanese are nutmeg, cayenne pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are attached to the legs of the chair which hang from both wings of the chair.
They give more stability to someone who is seated in a group, but can have safety problems caused by the possibility that the person's feet will become trapped.
If a rider is injured by a fall but has a bloody foot in the stirrup, he or she may be able to be caught by the horse. To minimize this risk, some safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with one heel and one smooth and slightly narrow toe.
Additionally, some chairs, particularly English chairs, have safety bars that allow a footrest to fall from a chair if a falling person trips over it.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier hiking destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high peaks and large granite boulders.
The peaks have spectacular cuckoo views, and climbers flock to them from all over the world, constantly finding new routes amid the sheer power of the falls.
Snowboarding sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve riding on snow-covered terrain or a board attached to feet.
Skiing is one of the most popular leisure activities with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who design entire ski vacations in particular locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational skiing association was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: This activity is also known as downhill skiing, alpine skiing or ski touring.
It includes sightseeing but does not usually include ski touring such as alpinism or mountain climbing, the latter done on rough terrain and requiring skiing or much harder boots.
Think of hiking trails as hiking-like paths.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than by walking - but only rarely will you achieve the speed of downhill skiing without a heavy bag on wet tracks.
Europe is a much smaller continent with many independent countries, and as a rule, travelling between them would mean going through visa applications and passport control more than once.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
Even when staying in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax agencies define goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products could be defined as antiques, although they are more similar to mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture revolving around trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even by tradition, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern trades, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a visa advisory, your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the policies of governments other than your own, but their policies are designed for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Notices are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The articles are often summary, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Adverse weather conditions is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and can take many forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, thunderstorms, and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather conditions, as are seasons, windstorms, rainstorms, and tornadoes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, hail, and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of any adverse weather conditions affecting their area which may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile environment course" may return the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course typically has a normal duration of 2-5 days and will include role-playing, extensive first aid and occasional weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are popular, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers considering gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure to bring valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender not indicated (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents in the same way can vary greatly.
Checkpoints have also become much tighter in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people undergoing surgery should not have to wait to go through the scanners without having their privacy and dignity violated.
Tidal currents are the flow of swirling waves that collide with the ocean, often a barrier reef or similar.
Due to the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas where a rip current can form into the deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Because you are not out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for some place where you won't be caught or, depending on your skills and if you have been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes before the culture shock (shorter than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adjusted easily to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adjust back to the culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your own culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding because they know that travelers have to get used to a new place.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are necessary until the travelers return home.
The pyramid's light and sound show is one of the area's main attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them quietly before the spectacle begins.
You're usually surrounded by the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is just a storybook.
The Sphinx is conceived as the setting and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown in the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have a number of military bases, with six active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the mainland, the largest of which is King George Island with the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded crater of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plain, then rise again to form the 225-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota River.
The northern or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with the highest at Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used for maritime navigation, including space navigation, as well as expeditions requiring remote voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those considering a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad for the gap year can greatly improve your chances of entering higher education when you return home.
There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in these education programs.
Finland is a popular boating destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands within the lakes and along the archipelago coasts.
In the archipelagos and in the lakes it is not clear that there is a need for a fan.
While in reality the archipelagos and lakes are quite large for paddlers, smaller boats or even canoes offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat carrying seven or eight people.
Almost the same is true for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but for the rest it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the distinguished Baltic cruises include a long stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of days before returning and crossing the bridge in the evening.
Landing is by boat only and does not require a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany, on the itinerary; as you can see from the map above Berlin has no nearby sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be afraid of: it is no different from personal fears or aversions to other things that many people do have.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on the unknown or out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering items quickly; often, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent arrangements.
On some routes, the larger carriers had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
Goods were shipped by air freight, sometimes taking days to clear loading and customs.
The only way to get it through quickly was to check it in as checked baggage; airline regulations would not allow checked baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or, alternatively, to convince your airline to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: what's more, you end up paying up to four times the normal cheap fare for business class and eighteen times for first class!
Most of the time, you don't even need to look for business or first class discounts when you're flying from A to B.
Airlines know that many travelers are willing to pay a premium to get to a destination quickly and comfortably, so they charge a premium.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova following the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center, situated around a broad valley and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, glass-faced bridges, and modern shopping malls are painted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík provides views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

To the north, and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which became famous to foreigners after an illuminating account of its wonders documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north he also visits the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima (Shrine), a world-famous Marian apparition site.
Remember that you are essentially visiting the site of a mass grave, and a site that makes almost incalculable sense to a substantial portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who have lived out their lives here, and many more who have loved ones who were killed or worked here until death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Treat the site with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not scrub the site by scraping or engraving graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signals are only indicated in Catalan as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular metro announcements are made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with Paris is always to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well brought up).
The sudden appearances of Parisians will quickly evaporate if some basic friendliness is shown.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a very wide variety of plant communities, due to the range of microclimates, the different soil types and the varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, ostrich, lynx, wild boar and chamois can be found here, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear veils that cover the genitals and must also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide blankets for unprepared mourners, but your own, especially a brightly coloured one, is worn to obtain a receipt from the priest or nun at the entrance.
Along the same lines, men are required to wear trousers that cover the legs.
This can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance but this animal is not bled after each user so days you can not feel comfortable wearing these garments.
Majorcan cuisine, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (mostly pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A popular snack, especially during the holiday season, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any available condiments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie pro tue, always begin with a lowercase letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to differentiate between verbs and objects.
Undoubtedly it also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most commonly used letters are c and g, the pronunciation of which varies according to the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and largely regular grammar.
So, reading this grammar book would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may conclude that Portuguese is so close that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now out of use, remaining as museums or places of education.
Because light pollution in their golden age was not the kind of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are very large structures in areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where the plum blossom was the choice flower.
In Japan, the first flower carnivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants show their best in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" sample.
When visiting a formally organized garden, collecting "samples" will get you kicked out without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to live and is very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything when you arrive.
But being located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator they have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There is also some mail going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the mail you are planning to pick up goes inside Hebron and not just near the Jewish village of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme on which to base a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sailing through the Erie Canal.
They also define popular hiking and cycling routes.
Easter is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter hidden in some exposed spot to see the tree.
There are certainly Christian teleological explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a pre-Christian Fertility Dawn ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the end of Easter week, with congregations often joining together in celebration to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, boiling, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals were not able to make the journey, allowing the giant tortoise to be the main animal to graze in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, mice, chickens and dogs.
Visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter to experience the polar night, which indicates that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, when the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore not a problem, they can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Dresses are standard work attire, and colleagues are muted according to their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is critical, as it places emphasis on group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often must obtain approval from superiors for all decisions they make, and must follow instructions from superiors without question.
