This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory that was already prevalent, but it provides fossil details not commonly previously available such as coloration and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the wings of this animal were chestnut-brown above and pear or carotenoid below.
This new information also provides insight into wing development in birds.
Because dinosaur wings lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other wing features such as barbs and barbules - researchers estimate that the rachis is a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The wing structure suggests that they were used for temperature regulation or display rather than in flight. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and not the vestigial wings of a chick.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed paper indicating their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the authorities verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, observes that "journalists are treading a dangerous path by publishing photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which was in overall charge of the prosecution, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made until at least the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, refers to a border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is integral to the two countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA agrees to give up such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were to be monitored by rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received extensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards fresh elections.
Commission Martelly was responsible for the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests began over the failure to hold elections, some as late as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, with a total of six catching fire and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-critical".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management said there was no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists in the Philippine capital, Manila, and is holding them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several abductees were released and at least 6 deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six of the kidnapped, including children and the elderly, were soon released, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, an elderly woman needed to use the restroom and photographers sat on the spot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began investigating preterm labor pains in her spare time at the hospital where she was working.
His research suggests that if a hormone is administered it will accelerate maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tributes to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is the strangest person I've ever met...maybe more than that...love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those surveyed, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness is in doubt due to her complaints.
He has been unable to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain as he has been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets have probably been the source of organic materials as well as water delivery to Earth that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and stupidity".
He has been speculated to run for the presidency in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is one such system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to point aircraft with greater accuracy and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is being deployed and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the ground.
Fears of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published by Jupiter in the journal Science reported the formation of a nubuck bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that nine species have evolved in only two generations, although this process is thought to take longer due to interbreeding between a single native Darwin finch, Geospia fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospia conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small sizes.
Its leaves can be pulled into strings, which can be twisted and folded. It can be marked or wrapped in leaves.
It could be made into many sheets, and glued onto other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
One chemical is called pH. You could make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Twist two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a bowl.
The moisture in your hand will react with the outer layers, forming a strange texture and a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
Where you used to call someone thousands of miles away, you used a satellite.
Satellites receive a call in space and then reflect it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of their light and vision.
A huge rocket more than 100 feet high is required to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The wheel that has done the most for us is provide us with very easy and fast transportation.
It brought us trains, cars and many other means of transport.
They have lower more medium-sized bills that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are a number of small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niches, each niche having a particular function that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides range from one to three related adult males, with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Being a large family of sisters and daughters, the females are particularly closely related to each other.
Lion prides are largely made up of packs of wolves or working dogs, animals that behave surprisingly like lions (but not any other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
A skilled athlete, a tiger can climb (but not very well), swim, leap great distances and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
Tiger-like groups (genus Panthera) such as lions, leopards and jaguars, are among the only four mammals that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not the full-throated roar of a lion, but a more raucous, shrill phrase.
The ocelot prefers to hunt small animals. If it could, it would catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot preys on are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots stalk animals and search for food by scent when they are on the ground.
They have excellent night vision which enables them to see in the dark, and move very quietly, too.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves to a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a barrier island so that it will not easily be overtaken) then it will find itself in an environment notably different from what it was before.
There were different resources and different competitors in this new environment, so the new population would need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than before.
The native population has not changed at all, they are still the first to need adaptation.
Over time, as nomadic populations begin to adapt to their nomadic environment, they become less visible to other populations.
Eventually, after many thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, meaning the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Trees produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food by photosynthesis from the sun. They also provide shade.
Most of the food we eat comes from trees. Without trees, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the greatest hunter of its time and was therefore feared by all but other mosasaurs.
Its flexible jaw was equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with an additional set in the roof of its mouth, which meant it could not escape anything in its path.
I'm not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, small fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It could dive into water and attack anything; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
As is familiar to us from much of their food, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women preferred to eat their meals sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to eat together, with a bed next to them while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not incorporate foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods and considered the local deity to be their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; storehouses were open counters that could be seen from the street. Stones were used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no forests, so timber was expensive.
Greenland was very sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and during further travels west, discovered Greenland and named it Gr√∏nland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there.
Each of those countries was Scandinavian, but Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different peoples, kings, customs and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. There's something written on the back of that document.
The Declaration of Independence was followed by the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears on the lower reverse of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in life, large parchment documents (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) were wrapped for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
After the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, the north of France was liberated, but the south was not.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than fight the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civix, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, defining the size of a society to some extent.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge across many generations, a smooth cultural footprint, and equitable diffusion.
Smaller civilizations mostly disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state officials to enforce its acts, which were often uncooperative.
They had no power to repeal the tax laws and duties between the states.
The amendment of the Articles required the consent of all the States and the States took the Central Government so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, are the world's second most successful teams and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands located near Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, where European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated changes in aboriginal grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) powers took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size close to the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) of this format is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) equal or approximate this aspect ratio.
The overused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining the scale of arrangement in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
Meanwhile in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity held European states together for over a thousand years.
Its omnipotence affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specifically for this.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle of religion had been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the sea, which also posed a threat to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response from its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such situations again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing distinct time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty that held power had a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of provinces divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period there were fierce wars between several nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms together were one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with several thousand people killed for occupying the highest place in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that countries belong to the people, not a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution the professions were opened to all male applicants allowing all to be ambitious and successful.
The same goes for the army because instead of army rankings being based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave known as the "Hira", known for its mountain of "Nur" (light) for meditation.
Those caves, which survived the passage of time, give a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's a complete isolation.
Above, there is nothing but a clear, blue sky and some surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Dead Valley contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the family members of Khufu's wives.
The "upper bow" marks the V that is visible and the "lower bow marks" a staple or a square that is visible as the lower part disappears.
Upper means that you should start from the top and push the lever, and lower means that you should start from the elbow (where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
An overtone typically produces a softer sound, while a downtone is stronger and more vocal.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember that printed sheet music marks are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
Fearless King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young grandsons (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on the evening of 6 October 1789.
Riding in a carriage, he fled to Paris, surrounded by a crowd shouting against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
A member of the crowd once waved a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large fraction of the costs of US colonial rule and to pay interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
There is no doubt that the enormous profits to be made from the long - term exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the core profits of US imperialism.
To understand Tumblr one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages which is the period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was the era that preceded the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages whose end is traditionally dated to 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-encouragement or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is motivated by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their expression in technology.
The base interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has "impacts" on inherent societies rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that motor cars essentially develop roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the cost of buying cars.
Large-scale car purchases have led to road accidents, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual and over time customs and cultures emerged in that geographical area and these societies adapted to the location better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a major centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders brought gifts of silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the early period, this Eastern dress culture was heavily influenced by the Byzantine.
These styles may be 25 to 30 years behind in the West due to slower communication channels.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own styles. As a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to tie clothes, one of the greatest developments of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, predominantly organic system, using indigenous seeds from protected ecological zones for maximum yield with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still practiced in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel themselves marginalized on social norms and help develop identity consciousness.
Members of subcultures may be differentiated from others by their age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
Subcultures have characteristics that distinguish them from others and may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture signal their membership through the use of idiosyncratic qualities and symbolism of more recent styles, including fashion, mannerism, and logic systems.
One of the methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to some unfortunate cases of children being neglected, unfortunate, deliberately abused and not socialized by adults during child development.
Such children are called "animalistic" or feral. Some animalistic children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases such children were abandoned by their parents because of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma prior to being abandoned or away from home.
Others charge that he was raised by animals; others say that he lived alone in the wilderness.
When brought up entirely by non-human animals" the behaviors that the animalized child exhibits (within physiological limits) are almost entirely those of the care-animal such as its fear of or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolds are not a learning method but an aid that provides support to a person who is learning something new such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, "a teacher is a form of scaffolding, just like the little paperclip man in Microsoft's office".
Virtual scaffolds are internalised into the software and are meant to question, indicate and understand processes that may be challenging to handle by the student population.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and forced recovery.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where nutrition, care and education are lacking.
We see the foster care system as a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is expected to meet needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet from the perspective of usage and satisfaction pave the way for additional dimensions.
For example, Internet use has been cited as an important motivation for "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
When audience responses to websites were examined, "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational dimensions by Ehme and McCord (1998).
The use of video recording has paved the way for important discoveries for the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The Presidential Speech, suggested that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to assess truth.
He also suggested that similar abilities are used in animals such as the domestic dog in explaining human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of this genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation; selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Isolation and recombination are followed by alternating variation between the two pools with each generation.
For primates with a similar digestive system to humans in the savanna region, it is difficult to meet their amino-acid requirements from the plant resources available.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: such as growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources are found in leaves and beans, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest until they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (chickens, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but they provide high amounts of protein that contains essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the same way savannah chimpanzees do today.
The process of intentionally falling asleep during a normal sleep period and then falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes) is called interrupted sleep.
A silent alarm clock can be used to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your clock in your sleep, you can move it to another part of the house so that you don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking so much fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed that the person has to force themselves to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The less stress there is, the more positive the life force will be. Each person has the potential for ultimate peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands between us and that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and some techniques of yoga from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visual means.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deva Yoga. Through the vision of various deities, the energy veins are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the Prarabdha consciousness is created.
The common enemy of Germany in World War II paved the way for cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and, in reality, would be fought by proxy armies from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other theaters of war.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup with a Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral, forming the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to bring troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
There the German Navy was attempting to intercept traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to keep them for their milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often by goatherds who were mostly children or adolescents, much like the more widely known herders. These methods of animal husbandry are still used today.
Wagonways were developed in the 16th century in England.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to gain more speed and pull more weight than the more rugged roads of the day.
Crossties were started much earlier to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks were more efficient if they had a single piece of iron on top.
This became common, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the wagons wear more.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
Carrying the first known transport, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Saalanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We could start being more environmentally friendly, we could join the environmental movement, and we could even become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
These are symptomatic treatments in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extraordinary lifestyle of mankind.
July 4 After its adoption by Congress, a few blocks of handwritten drafts signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as the "Dunlop broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides still extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original manuscript copies survive.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there's something about birds that makes them seem like dinosaurs.
She has legs with scales and claws, she lays eggs, and she walks on her two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use the specific terminology of computers.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in the formal sense of a group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bats, insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
There are nuisance insects and bed bugs, which are adapted to live in their hosts' nests or housing.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a child.
These couples may choose to plan an adoption for their child.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Although it does not stand alone, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
How many rhythms are observed in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the free cyclic period in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They used two experiments to either label the proteins of the phage with DNA or radioactive sulfur with radioactive phosphorus in the phage.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells or not.
Mutations in only germ-line cells can be passed to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery including the wildlife of trees and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
One example is learning about, photographing and visiting orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and he is joined by others whose work destination is the place he just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transportation shuttle is connected in some way, supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its steady states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you would rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers really incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable stability and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, the relationship between three main characteristics is established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a large array of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many thought otherwise, that the solar system, including the sun (and even all other stars), revolved around the earth.
This calls for a mind with wisdom. Do you not know that the earth is round?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Of all the rivers on Earth, 20 percent of the water flowing into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The length of the main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
However, pyramid-building on stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but was never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction by the Pyramids of Giza.
The Nabaka Empire, their ancestors, marveled at the ancient Egyptian monuments, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they can be found naturally in nature and tunneling with primitive tools was relatively easy.
Aristotle, a philosopher who theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
These were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that what we see is a new, altered form of matter.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. It should not be forgotten that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. In fact there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Incredibly, atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil was produced, it became a good friend for many people.
Sadly, as new writing systems appeared, the status and use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a sharpener.
One might wonder what will happen to keyboards when something new is here.
Fusion bombs work on the principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy car up a hill. It's splitting the nucleus and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they are torn apart with little or no indirect pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the permafrost.
The thickness of the near side is about 70 km and the thickness of the outer side is about 100 km.
It is thinner below the maria (lower elevations on the Moon) and thicker below the highlands.
There may have been more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Case theory focuses on finding out what attracts or appeals to people.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature to adulthood.
This theory looks at what it is about some people that makes them want the things that they do and what it is about their environment that motivates them to do or not do something.
Two popular case theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behaviour can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "the boy next door" (or the girl next door).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, fear is transformed into a stranger, who realizes that he must change everything the party is doing and embrace it.
After all, leadership is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often these behaviors are the result of disagreements between the leadership and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are all held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be explained by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larsen & LaFastow, 1989, p109) is also a typical component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of organizational learning is to put the concept into practice for everyone.
When all available resources in the functional department of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can be communicated.
As a result, an organization's processes work together to overcome barriers, which can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Seamless Order Approach as the method used to help organizations reach high levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence from a theoretical perspective for investigating cognition. It therefore narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior helps the scientist in his research.
It has long been understood that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
This new technology allowed us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we had never seen before.
It provides me with a lot of information and material to build a continuous model of the mechanisms that help me understand the processes in my own mind.
Although AI has a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnosis and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Study tours are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will take her students to places she likes where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides solutions with virtual study tours.Students can ride along with their class to view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or admire fine art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually makes up for it.
Since students are often the most important audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging together "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to nurture the interest of the audience motivates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond their traditional school days.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet content, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oreveke, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital and is home to a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
In the far south are Niagara Falls and in the north is Muscat of the Uncommon Natural Beauty and home to more than a dozen wineries.
All of these things highlight Ontario as Canadian at its best by outsiders.
Large areas in the far north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited forest.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the land, and it became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passengers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not just the one that costs too much).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, handled, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and only after it was abandoned following an earthquake in 1755, it was rebuilt as Casa Branca.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badiya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders, who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the following interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling the full range of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, mite pots, leather goods, hookahs, and gigos, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
Lava from the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002 devastated Goma and buried much of the city, especially the downtown area and most of the mountainside.
Ona and Goma are safer than other cities, but information about the fighting in North Kivu province should be sought before any trip outside Goma.
The town is the base-ground for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano, one of Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla treks.
To travel around the city of Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
With its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as an attractive metaphor for a distant land.
Now, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport nearby.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arabic flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SanParks).
Of all South Africa's national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
Purchasing a wild card can be beneficial for anyone, providing access to any or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is the site of many tourist attractions.
The rows of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of the waters of local Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists made their own and so is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian interior.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just mangrove swamps - it includes some of the last surviving bases of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq. km, of which about one-third comprises wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japan Coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of travelling to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and has two lanes each 3.50 metres wide.
The lower vertical clearance of the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of encounters of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) with a value set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located across from the FIC South Store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and United States dollars are widely accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 ¬∞C are common.
Winter weather can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the air and humidity combine to make it feel colder than a thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distance.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking odorous foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the war of independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lilofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the spread of its two harbours. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay, and at St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family tourist beaches with various shops along the shore. It is safe to swim here.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can go the distance.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to get scared of bottled water if you're thirsty.
To Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A small black 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a high proportion of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries to the reef from any of these causes are rare.
Then, consult officials, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found beyond these times.
Sharks do exist, though they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives passengers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They may also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However any modifications or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending concerts decide to camp on site, and most attenders consider this an important part of the experience.
If you wanted to be closer to the action, you had to leave early to get to a campsite closer to your music.
Keep in mind that even if the music stops on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the noise is terrible for those most affected by ice crossing.
Saint Petersburg cruises include holidays in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make several attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Window clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to see the way out.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks at home. However, drinking impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Those who are going to drive over high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of frost, snow or freezing temperatures.
On icy and muddy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or condensation or snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are a draw for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey underground to view stunning African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to come close to cars and high-level equipment allows for better viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also called "bush walks", "hiking safaris" or "walking" safaris) involve hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend beyond the end of March until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you would not like to wear pressed socks, you could try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, others require several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergies, spread toxins, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in some places.
Travelers bound for countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save large amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through desolate forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use your discretion: straight gradients, narrow streets, and sharp turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are much lower than for the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than other forms.
Curiously, however, mobile phone service there is much stronger than in some other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria, their southern neighbor, similar to Austria, is very rich and diverse.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are baked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired especially well with strong coffee.
If you want something small but rich, try Berliner, Pfaffenkuchen or Kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on the spicing of herbs with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of juice.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without an adjective, the word agu originally referred to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Available widely throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of a range of dishes commonly experienced, with the predominant flavors favored by Javanese being peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The rack is a support for the rider's legs hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming trapped.
If the rider is thrown from the horse, but his legs get caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the horse's running. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, very narrow, floors.
Following this, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety straps that prevent loose leather from falling off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and crags.
The summit includes breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes between the endless possibilities of its walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which sends people into steeper terrain where more rigid skis and boots are required.
Think of a skiing trail as a similar canal hiking trail.
In good conditions you'll be able to cover slightly more distance than walking - but in many you'll have the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on your prepared track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but composed of many independent countries. Traveling through different countries usually means going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen Zone acts somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you lived in the area, you could usually cross the border without passing through passport control checkpoints.
Thus, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes an antique. Some revenue agencies define items more than 100 years old as antique relics.
There are geographic variations in the definition, where age limits may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
