This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, of which theroy are already abundant, but it also shares features that fossils in general cannot, such as the color and arrangement of the trunks.
Paleontologists say the animal's feathers were khaki in color with a brownish or carotenoid outer coat.
The find also sheds light on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-defined groove, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have suggested that the rachis evolved later than these other features.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature measurement or observation. Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows signs of maturity and not juvenility.
Researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the pattern actually represents the feathers of a large one and not that of a juvenile.

Adekoya is still in the Edinburgh Magistrates' Court on trial for the murder of her son.
He is in jail awaiting sentencing and trial, but any testimony of witnesses may be tainted because his picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of the pictures as discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be heading down a dangerous road of publishing images of suspects".
The head office, which is the general prosecutor's office, indicated to the press that no further response would be given until the indictment.
The document, according to the source, will address border disputes, which Palestine claims according to the pre-1967 Mideast War borders.
Other topics include the future status of Jerusalem under the two-state solution and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants the soldier to remain in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to cease presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary control trial were closely monitored by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation and NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot have received full safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn into the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission issued a decree on CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some as recently as 2011.
Some 60 reports of iPod malfunctions were reported, making a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 equipment-related hazards.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "not significant".
The agency responded by calling Apple's relocation report "truly disappointing".
The earthquake struck Marian at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman treats Hong Kong tourists rudely by stopping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were quickly released, since Filipino photographers were present.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly woman as she needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland Women's State Hospital in 1959.
While working at a hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research indicated that when used, the hormone could accelerate the growth of a baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators later recovered the plane's two 'black box' records on Wednesday.
Fellow journalists have also recommended Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months ago. It's really different like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as unique as I am... perhaps more so... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place".
Of the more than 1,400 people who voted prior to the 2010 election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those on the ballot share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Toward the end of the voting period, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should quickly become a republic, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had hoped to swim the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints his fitness suffered.
He could not take the pills needed to overcome his pain because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the acquisition using hardware and software since February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been the source of earth's water supply as well as a fertilizer that could produce proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since the dawn stars collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration a year early and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He refers to such rumors as "political rhetoric and jokes".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based technology to allow air traffic control to directly monitor aircraft in real time and provide pilots with accurate information.
No extra trains stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or parking facilities in the area.
Fear of a lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the game will be forced behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the introduction of new species of birds to the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have arisen from just these two generations, although this process was believed to take longer, because of interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the finch's outer shell, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into various shapes. It can be made into smaller shapes.
It can be drawn into thin thread, which can be twisted and woven. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and mounted on another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "manuscripts on gold or silver leaf".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indication by using red cabbage juice.
The color of cooked soup changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic.
The pH levels are indicated by the number of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Rub the two drying powders together and then, with clean hands, knead them into a ball.
The tapping on your hands is going to work with the outer layer, which will sound funny and form a kind of rhythm.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a latrine within each city, along with a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the mortar system have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Or there are the baths of ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mixed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with some of our light and vision.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite, or telescope, into space.
The wheel has revolutionized the world in a remarkable way. What it has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized reptiles, from rabbits to locusts and deer.
Finally, there are the many small cats (including pet cats) that eat large numbers of a number of predators, such as insects, rats, ticks, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, the special function that each cat has to prevent it from competing with others.
Lions are sociable cats, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are made up of one male or of three related males, as well as as many as thirty females and lions.
The women are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions, such as packs of wolves or dogs, animals whose behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats), are also very dangerous to their prey.
A construction toy, this tiger can climb (not very well), swim, fly great distances, and pull five times as hard as a human.
The leopard is in the same genus (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and big cats.
The leopard's roar is not like that of a full-grown lion, but more like a roaring, piercing roar.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Most of the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists suspect that ocelots detect and locate potential prey by scent, smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they move slowly, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then snatching their prey.
When a small group of organisms (microorganisms) becomes separated from the larger group from which they came (as when they move to higher ground or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different uses and different competitors, so this new society will need different things or habits to be competitive than they needed before.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they still lack the same customs.
During this time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look different.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call the process biogenesis, which simply means the creation of new life. Biogenesis is not an inevitable consequence and is an essential part of the evolutionary process.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and our blankets from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most advanced predator of its time, so it was fearless, except for one mosasaur.
Its long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth, and an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that might pass in front of it.
We will never know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been an apex predator.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not keep up with it.
While many of their dishes may be familiar to us, the Romans had their own unique set of ingredients for the feast, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of cocoon called a field mouse
One difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on couches, the rich men preferred to have several meals together where they could sit side by side.
Ancient Roman food would not be included among the foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia for many years to come.
For example, they had no peas, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cacao, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a cucumber.
The Babylonians built temples, which they viewed as the dwelling places of their deities.
People offered sacrifices to the spirits, and the priests would try to satisfy the spirits' needs through rites and ceremonies.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner courtyard to which only the priests may enter.
Sometimes these unique towering pyramidlike structures, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the building was a shrine to the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not of great value.
Much of Hebrew family life centered on spiritual matters.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
Also, there are no dense forests in the land of Canaan, so logs were a real test.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he sailed west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But in spite of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences among the people, kings, activities, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Whatever is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Declaration of True Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows by whom it was written, it was well-known early in its life, a huge parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) commissioned for preservation.
Thus, it is possible for imagination to be added as fuel.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders but did not fight back.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, an invasion code-named "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning coexistence, related to the Latin civis, meaning population, and civitas, meaning city or town, and that in some sense describes the size of a community.
City-states are the predecessors of states. Civilizational culture refers to the transmission of knowledge to several communities, a model of culture that remains and spreads well.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving proper historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states established a weak central government for the first time - and the Confederacy was its only major component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The assembly lacked the power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it depended on the national government, which rarely intervened, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to pass tax laws and fees between governments.
The documents required the approval of all parties from all governments before they could be drafted, and the governments quickly took over the central government where its representatives had always been absent.
The Italian national soccer team, along with the German national soccer team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Northern provinces, and Italians compete in national games and Olympic festivals.
Japan occupies nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island group, Japan is often called an "archipelago"
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, proposed a revolution in grain production, and recruited Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar factories.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after victory in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controls the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the edges of this small town have been rebuilt to show visitors a better idea of what it was like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, a process that continues to this day.
For example, the world's standard motion picture format is 35mm, which was the largest film format at the close of the motion picture era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its size ratio has been inherited by digital camera tricks.
The 35mm lens is well, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm long.
The aspect ratio (dividing by 12 to get a simple integer ratio) is as stated, or 3:2.
Many common systems (APS and home formats, for example) are or can be equal to this aspect ratio.
A third principle that is often overlooked and ridiculed is the simple point of creating dynamism while setting the scale of change in motion.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is where the lines intersect, dividing the picture into triangles at the edges and at the top (see illustration).
At this point in Europe's history, the Catholic Church, wealthy and powerful, came under attack.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion had bound the kingdoms of Europe together despite linguistic and cultural differences.
It is an all-embracing force that affects everyone from the king down to the common man.
One of the tenets of the Christian religion is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church revenues should be cut accordingly.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether the idea of this creed had any merit.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy seemed to work, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the embargo violated accepted international norms embodied in two centuries of international agreements.
Britain dredged national waters to prevent any ships from entering the straits, causing danger even to native ships.
Since there was a buildup of reactions to this attempt, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the dominant ideology of many cities and countries was one of antagonism and separatism.
After seeing the carnage and atrocities of World War I, nations agreed to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking time; each Chinese dynasty or powerful family was one such dynasty.
Within each dynasty there were also years of instability of the provincial divisions. The most notable period of this era was the lengthy Three Kingdoms period that occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
In times of war, fierce battles have raged between many rulers for supremacy.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China. Thousands died fighting for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Reformation opportunities opened up to all male applicants allowing those with high ambitions and achievements to succeed.
In the military as well, because of the hierarchical nature of military ranks, they were ranked according to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in the possibilities beyond this life. He often went to the cave known as "Hira" on the symbolic "Noor" (light) Mountain.
nude, which has survived many times, gives a vivid picture of the spiritual beauty of Muhammad's religion.
Situated on one of the northern slopes of Mecca, the cave is quite isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find one, even if one knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Carved by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramids built to honor a dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several obelisks, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and their family lines.
The mark "above the bow" looks like a V, and the "below the bow" like a step or square of need is below it.
Top means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and bottom means that you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A high step usually produces a gentle sound, whereas a low step is forceful and emphatic.
Feel free to write down your own notes, but remember that the bowing notes printed are for musical purposes, so they should be set in the usual manner.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Queen Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of court ladies.
In a boxcar, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting and chanting slogans against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open wide the doors of their carriages.
On one occasion a member of the group shook the head of a murdered palace guard at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The cost of the U.S. occupation's war against the Filipinos has been borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to defray a large part of the costs and expenses over and above the mortgage payments made in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street real-estate bank.
Indeed, the huge profits derived from the destruction of the Filipino people will be a net gain for the U.S.
To understand the Templars one needs to understand the situation that prompted the creation of the order.
The epoch is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were followed by the Early Middle Ages and then the Late Middle Ages, which formally end in the 1500's.
Technological determinism is a term with many meanings, ranging from technological determinism or technological determinism to the more rigorous idea that human decisions are driven by an unseen concept linked to scientific laws or their progression within technology.
Most statements of technological determinism have two general assumptions: that technological improvement itself follows a path that is largely prior to cultural or political influence, and that technology has "consequences" for the communities that it serves, not social ones.
For example, one might say that good roads lead to better roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically suited for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass automobile liability creates a high incidence of traffic accidents, which prompts the development of alternatives in healthcare settings to repair damaged bodies.
The romances had a strong element of traditional motivation, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, people were shaped by geography, over time the customs and traditions associated with that geography developed, and these, individually and in a community setting, were better than coercive laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the new world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe.
Its fame as a center of literature began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its fortunes declined during the twenty-fifth century because the Crusaders had just returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first rock was largely influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, species in the west may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own system. One of their greatest advances of that time as a result of the Crusades people started to use buttons to fasten the bed covers.
Authentic farming is farming done for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple, often natural, process using stored seeds indigenous to the region combined with crop rotation or other simple methods to produce a high yield.
Historically most farmers were associated with subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by social class and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may fit together based on the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that identify such a distinct subculture may be language, art, religion, politics, gender, location, or a combination of factors.
Members of a culture often mark their membership by a distinctive and symbolic usage, which includes art, style, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate social value is from the unfortunate cases of a number of children who had experienced abandonment, misfortune, or abuse, not to mention neglect by adults as they grew up.
Such babies are called "parrots" or parakeets. Some parrot babies are confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' objection to mental or physical well-being.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or neglect before being abandoned or frightened.
Some are suspected to have been raised by animals; others are said to live in the forest itself.
When raised by nonhuman animals, a baby peacock develops behaviors (within walking distance) that closely resemble those of that pet, such as its fears of or aversion to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more enjoyable, instructional models work best.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but is a supportive, collaborative aid to people who are in the midst of a guided learning experience such as using a computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both spiritual or physical, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold but also a paper man in Microsoft Office.
Spirituality is an internal software and is designed to question, motivate, and explain processes that may have been difficult for students to do on their own.
Children are sent to Children's Home for many different reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse, to fraud.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care for, and teach, but they do.
We look forward to the Orphan Care System or a safe place for these children.
Our foster care program must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, adequate education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should supply all the needs that were lacking from the families from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines the second language of mass communication with face-to-face contact.
The independent features of the Internet lead to additional strategies in terms of applications and designs.
For example, "learning" and "social conversations" are thought to be drivers of Internet use (Jameset et al., 1995).
"Personal presence" and "developed relationships" were identified as new motivators by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated the responses of advocates to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important insights into the interpretation of small productions, facial movements that occur for fractions of a second.
Basically, it is said that one can tell if someone is lying by carefully interpreting subtle clues.
Olive Sacks, in her column The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to discuss humility realistically.
He actually suggests that modern abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with such animals as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genes: recessive and dominant.
Mutations add to this new genetic diversity, and this selection takes away from the diversity that was intended.
The division and reversal of the mixture repeats the difference back and forth between the two molecules in each generation.
Outside the Savanna, it is difficult for mammals with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy their amino-acid needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has significant consequences; increased stress, malnutrition, and violent death.
More readily available plant sources would be the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but they are difficult for organisms like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, insects, eggs) are not only easily digested, but they share high levels of proteins containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solve their "protein problem" in some way similar to what chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep latency is the process of intentionally waking up at your normal bedtime and returning to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily happen by using a silent alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up too much.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while asleep, it may be set in another room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Some noise-related choices involve drinking large quantities of liquids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before bedtime, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person enjoys is measured against another aspect of the abundance of harmony that exists within a person's body and soul.
When frustration is at a low ebb, that's when the positive life force kicks in.
Everyone reaches the light. The only thing that stands in the way of this perfection is our own lack of freedom and evil thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but they are supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and by many practices from Indian Yoga.
Officially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, mindfulness meditation, and a way to embrace all love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy to see light) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and closed eyes.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By seeing the various deities the energy pathways are cleared, the chakras are purified and the experience of enlightenment arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to an alliance between the USSR and the USA. In the aftermath of the war the clash of values, systems, and culture led to the country's collapse.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last 40 years and be fought virtually, by proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been breached, and the only hope was to go back and rebuild along Roman lines.
However, these plans were shattered overnight, when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army swept in and made a Belarusian and Ukrainian advance after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The role of the navy has long been to ensure that your country has the ability to transport your people and goods, while, at the same time, checking the ability of your enemy to transport his people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, German submarines, especially the U-boats, tried to stem the tide.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were kept with wandering herds in the mountains or other grazing areas, often led by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, like the better-known shepherds.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the chariot roads were of the same plank, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull more loads than on the dirt roads of the day.
In particular, however, it has been observed that tractors can be more efficient if they have a metal roof.
This has been a common practice, but the metal has caused severe corrosion on the wooden wheels of carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, iron rails were introduced.
The first known transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning erect man).
Almost before them, Australopithecus did not walk in holiness as citizens.
Evidence of bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can become part of the community, we can join the local council, and we can even become activists in order to reduce the uncertainty of the future to some extent.
But if we don't want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problems, and we have to cut it out.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of man's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's luxurious life-style.
After approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten document, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop several blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 cups were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first national reading of the document was by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The letter reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are also many similarities between dinosaurs and birds.
They have clawed feet and long claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in operation today are based on an enormous amount of information encoded in digital form.
The binary number can have only one of the digits, e.g. 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or fractions, to use the language of commas.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, generally preclude immediate diagnosis.
A telltale sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or a chemical product in the house.
Look at the poison-first-aid kit.
The word "insect" is used by entomologists to designate this group of ants.
The word comes from a long-standing association with bedbugs, which are insects that commonly infest humans.
both Killer bugs and Bed bugs live where they were born, usually inside the nest or house of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are about 400,000 reported cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the number one neurological disease among middle-aged and older people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
Couples may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to have custody of the child.
The couple may also choose to schedule an abortion for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover whether the world really works the way science says it does.
But it is not the only one, an experiment, as well as an experiment, is an experiment used to eliminate one or more possibilities from an unproven hypothesis, ask questions, and make observations in order to guide scientific inquiry.
Philosophers turned their attention to natural words, especially to the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in almost all scientific fields, including logic.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the sounds expected in biology and behaviour are highly dependent on the existence of internal processes and their production during biological times.
Time scales, which are not simply a translation of external time signals, are recorded for many living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-winding clocks that will keep time by the free movement of the hands even when external cues do not.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic unit.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or microbes, to grow their DNA inside a bacterium.
They performed two experiments to tag the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the organ and reproductive system involved, and whether the affected cells are of the same type.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the scents, plants, and wildlife.
Examples of such things that can be done locally include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystem information.
An example is touring, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns on motorbikes to go to their places of work and are passed by others whose workplace is a place they have never left.
Within a transportation system in which everyone is connected in some way, and supportive of it, the transportation system is based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its optimal conditions that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the city and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone is concerned about the transportation system.
In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about literal water shortages or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transportation system generate these current complaints, why do they fail day after day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Measurement is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the congestion they create.
Unfortunately, studying the effects of traffic is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within certain logical constraints; thus, traffic volumes tend to have logical consistency and can be represented statistically.
To better represent the rate of speed, alliances are made between three main qualities: (1) scale, (2) proportion, and (3) speed.
These associations help with the planning, creation, and operation of train stations.
Insects were the first animals to breathe air. Their ability to fly enabled them to evade most predators and to find food and mates more easily.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings back into the body.
This gives them many different places to hide from their enemies.
Today, the flies that cannot retract their wings are mostly dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but most people believed otherwise; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to four miles [6 km] wide.
Twenty percent of the water that pours from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The mighty Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although masonry construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the towers of Giza were unsurpassed in size and architectural beauty.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their followers, beautiful for a thousand years.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislature and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most civil servants, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of the Vatican is Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since these can be found throughout nature in natural form and are easily mined with large equipment.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was made up of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was the case with the four states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they could change into new substances to make what we see.
A compound is simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are seen as metals. In fact, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
You can have compounds that include a minimum of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything on earth is made of something. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit into the space at the end of this word.
Thus, the pencil was a good companion for many when it first came out.
Sadly, with the advent of these new writing methods, the pencil has fallen into disuse.
People now type messages on computers, which will soon be commonplace.
One might wonder what the hippopotamus will be like when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nuclei later releases their energy.
Some atoms have defective nuclei, which means that they tend to break with or without a push.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
A leopard can be as close as 45 miles [70 km] on the near side and as far as 60 miles [100 km] on the far side.
I went very slowly under the marshes and crouched down under the hills.
There may also have been maria near the edge because the crater is angular in shape.
Ideas are geared to finding what appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain pains and/ or tumors lodged in their head as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about other people that makes them want the things they do and what factors in their environments might make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two attitudes may emerge as grooms begin to visit their peers first. One moderate outcome is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of administrator has the problems of making unpopular choices, enacting legislation, conducting investigations, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the end of the scale, one morphs into a stranger who feels he must change everything the group was doing and do his own thing.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This attitude often creates a division between those who are in authority and those who are not.
Classes are held at the same skill level as a fellowship class, but there are differences that are not mentioned.
Gang members often serve as a focal point for an easily identifiable group.
They often enjoy a greater degree of autonomy than the average group member, since their group may meet at different local times that may not be recognized by their local authority.
The very existence of an "invisible class" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is part of the characteristics of a spiritual class.
The "invisible team" is the executive team to which members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an academic department?
When all the available resources are employed in all parts of the organization, production and authenticity take place.
For this reason, an organizational process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a newly designed process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can execute, leadership must create a culture of execution and shared knowledge and learning about the organization.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve high levels of performance.
The data of neurobiology provides a case for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. It thus narrows the field of inquiry and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports Scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, lesions, eye injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in the functioning of other parts of the brain.
The advent of these dying technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain regions and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Al has a strong science fiction connotation, Al forms a very important part of computer science, manipulation, learning, and artificial intelligence.
Research in AI includes designing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and organizing, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
Such things are going to be distance learning courses, aimed at sharing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into a number of home computers and video-mapping software applications.
Excursions are a major part of the class. Often the teacher will want to take his students to places where a bus trip was not an option.
Technology offers a solution to space travel. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting in their rooms.
Sharing a trip in the air is also a good way to look back on the trip and share experiences with future roommates.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to Empire City, every year the website is updated, but the old plans are kept on the air to serve as a reference book.
Social media can also help and improve students' writing. While students often start their online experiences with poor spelling and typos, the presence of mentors generally changes that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the author of the Web site strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, social media "forces students to be smart about the world around them". The need to feed viewers' curiosity motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Social networking is a tool that promotes teamwork, and it encourages students to pursue learning beyond the normal school day.
Effective use of social media "can empower students to be more critical and analytical; by editing online texts, students can explain their positions within the texts of others and also express their opinion on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful bilingual city with artistic styles and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Farther down south are Niagara Falls, and to the north I am home to the even more pristine natural beauty of Muskoka.
All of this and more marks Ontario as what is seen as a model of Canada by outsiders.
Vast areas farther north are flooded, and some are on the verge of wiping out wildlife.
To compare that surprisingly large population: There are more African Americans living in the US than Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the middle of the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent countries, or dependencies of France, and are not known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it took root in Comoros and Mayatte.
European influence and exploration began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama established the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: It is recommended that wives address any guests as being married, regardless of their marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too high- tech.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as torture and it is not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed, etc.
Say no firmly to men, and do not be afraid to stand up for your point of view (cultural difference or not, it does not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was employed by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as an entry strategy called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The ruler of Morocco rebuilt the mosque as Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who began trading there.
Casablanca is home to some of the most eye-catching mini-malls in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, pipes, and various ornaments, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo toward the east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered many of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goa is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma must be explored to understand the conditions of the ongoing war in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo's grazing ladder as well as a test trail for Africa's Mountain Gorilla.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual fare (at home) is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Combined with its frequent inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" will be used as a symbol for remote, inaccessible lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of poverty, although its culture makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the highlights during PBS's landmark Henry Louis Gate's Eyes of the African World.
The city is quite different from other cities in the country, in that it has more Arabs than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different animals.
It is one of South Africa's largest and is regarded as the precursor to the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily entrance fees for the park.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants admission to one section of South Africa's parks or to all of South Africa's Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
A reflection of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is depicted on a shimmering chart reflected in the very waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon when there is water on the other side.
The urban sprawl of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonists claimed as their own, and if you are looking for evidence of an early colonial settlement, this is the best place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's oldest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 50 miles [80 km] into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A section of jungle in the interior of India is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove thickets - they include some of the last areas of thick jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there may now be 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 antelope have been seen in the area.
Buses leave the bus terminal at the interchange (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses at intersections are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Many districts are served by Japan's small Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis operate faster and are the best way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Dam is a cable-stayed dam. It spans the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 272 feet [83 m], are 1,200 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The permitted height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is set to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian cargo terminals are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were an indigenous group indigenous to what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as hunter-gatherers who also practiced true agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, called the "Cherry Province of the Indies", was born as a result of contact between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Starting with the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to establish much of its cultural identity and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can be seen at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose face value is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged only at a bank in the Stanley islands rather than at a Western FIC store.
British pounds will be accepted everywhere within the islands and on Stanley credit cards, and dollars of the United States of America are also commonly accepted.
On landlocked islands cards will not be accepted, although British and U.S. ones may be; check with the vendor first to see which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland money outside the islands, as you change money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is in the southern Hemisphere, it is summer there and winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a tropical climate; during the summer months, temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but air and moisture combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] away from other wildlife!
Although they may look quite harmless, bison, elk, moose, bear, and all large animals can attack.
Each year, thousands of visitors are injured because they do not give way. These animals are large, aggressive, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing odorous food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to dock.
All the ships were sunk, except one British ship. 200 American and German lives were lost.
During a war of independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are also many beaches, thanks to the occupation of only two harbor areas.
The North Shore Seas (North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many share mangroves.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive at Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a variety of attractive shops lining the shore.
The largest native bear is 'Number One', not a messy bear, but sweet and refreshing. One native bear is called "Manta".
There are also many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
Local tap water is quite safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
To Australians, the concept of 'white' coffee is foreign. The short black is 'espresso,' the cappuccino comes with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is a Belgian specialty. Fruit drinks are expensive but delicious.
Most trips to the mountains are made year-round, and injuries from nonmountaineering causes are rare.
In the meantime, take advice from law enforcement, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near coasts and along rivers from October to April in the northern 1770s. They can sometimes be found outside of these times.
There are sharks, but they seldom attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of humans and may bite humans.
Saltwater crocodiles rarely live in the sea, their habitat usually being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have a contract with certain hotels, although you may find it possible to make other accommodations, such as camping trips, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transportation to/from the airport, or a combined flight and hotel package.
They can hold your deposit for you if you need time to think about the assignment or to obtain other travel documents (e.g. a visa).
Any cancellations or requests should first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most concertgoers choose to camp on the grounds, and most attendees consider themselves an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get in early to find a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even when the music in the main arena may have ended, there may be parts of the party that will continue with music until midnight.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are traveling through the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as walking through the ice can make a terrible noise for those involved.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers do not require visa requirements (see regulations).
Casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and doors are not as common, and doors are not easy to find.
They usually have fine food, drinks, and entertainment on offer, cheerfully accommodate guests, and seat them in the area.
However, drunkenness affects judgment, and gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in mountainous or hilly areas must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the barrier is low and you will not be driving as if you were on tarmac.
During the winter, enough snow to block your path comes down in a very short time.
Apparently, it can also prevent falling or blown snow or ice jams from forming on car windows.
On the other hand, icy or snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is not disturbed year-round.
Jungle tours are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a popular attraction for many visitors.
The word safari popularly refers to an overland journey to see African wildlife, especially in the desert.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to vehicles, and basic equipment allows better vision.
Lions, leopards, and tigers are shy on some days and will be better seen with binoculars.
A photographic expedition (also called a "jungle walk", "photographic trek", or "hiking") is a long journey, of several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement is made, you may have a more difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but starting in late March most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not expire until July 2020.
It is expected that most tickets for the festival will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and average tickets may cost as little as ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for loan, though none are in the room.
If iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the cloth get too hot (this could cause it to boil, or in extreme cases, crack).
There are many methods of water purification, some effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and should you have a complaint, then consider buying your water in a sealed container from a reputable company.
Visitors may encounter animals unfamiliar to them from their native regions.
Lice can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in extreme cases, cause infection, spread poison, or transmit disease.
Automatically transmitted pathogens, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by tick bites, never qualify as pets.
Shopping after work is an opportunity to shop for tax-free items and events in other locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable money, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
Smog on the slopes of Point Marion and Fairmont presents a major challenge to driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, especially in backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: bumps, narrow tracks, and switchbacks abound.
The imposed speed limits appear to be lower than on successive sections passed - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and prevent worship on them more significantly than otherwise.
Curiously, though, cell-phone service is much stronger here than at other points along the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
German pastries are delicious, and Bavarian ones, just like their neighbors, Austria, are rich and varied.
Canned fruit dishes are popular, and apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often accompanied by a strong cup of coffee.
If you prefer small flat cakes, try the locally made Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Soup is a dish made with herbs and spices, as well as meat or vegetables.
Soup can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of ingredients.
In the regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional dishes found across the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the word tends to refer to the cuisine native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cooking includes a variety of mildly spiced foods, Javanese flavors being marmalade, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices for seasoning.
The saddle tread is now a support for the rider's legs that hang down the sides of the saddle.
They provide great stability for the passengers but may raise safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his leg is caught by the bridle, he can be pulled along if the horse is startled. To reduce this risk, safety restraints can be taken.
For one thing, many poor people wear well-made boots with a smooth, white sole.
Later, saddles, especially English saddles, have safety features that allow leather to fall off the saddle when pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's great hiking trail, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its great variety of granite and limestone walls.
Climbers from around the world continue to invent new routes between the endless possibilities of their walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing on skis or skis attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many hopefuls, often called "ski bums", planning their entire vacation between ski trips in one area.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict people skiing as far back as 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first large-scale ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Snowshoeing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, snowboarding, or cross-country skiing.
It is related to but not always appropriate to alpine skiing or snowboarding, the latter being practiced on slopes and requiring hard skiing and boots.
Think of a flight path through snow as being like a hiking trail through a forest.
In good weather you may be able to cover distances that may be longer than walking - however, you will rarely find cross-country skiing without a backpack made of sticks.
Europe is a small continent but has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries requires multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like any other country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can cross the bridges without going into the passport office again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for Schengen member countries far away, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define property more than 100 years old as an antique.
The definition has regional variation, with the age limit being shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be described as old-fashioned, even though they are smaller than many similar products.
Grandmothering is an important way of life among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many of these or other occupations.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi have farmed reindeer over a large area, but they have lived by hunting, trapping, and the like, keeping reindeer mainly as livestock.
Today most Sámi work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanies, the word "Gypsy" is often considered derogatory because of its association with certain misconceptions and stereotypes of the Romani people.
