While there appears to be one experimental vaccine capable of reducing Ebola deaths, so far, no drugs have been proven effective for treating existing infections.
A cocktail of one of the antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in this area, but formal studies indicated that the benefit of this cocktail was less than the benefits sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that the scientists set it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the mission of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the U.S. Olympic Committee's statement that the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can best be served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than revoking licenses.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally don't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a fully developed axis, which is called a "luminal axis", but they do have other features of feathers -- like brushes and microbushes -- the researchers concluded that the luminal axis was most likely an evolutionary outgrowth of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not a chick's rump.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers, not chick feathers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations that had been made of the Milky Way.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by radical tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way attracts the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that natural matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in something like a halo, and it's made up of small particles in large numbers.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with being holes deep in the ground", said Glenn Cushing of the USGS and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: where voters isolate themselves in a booth, and place a pre-printed piece of paper naming their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the envelope is placed in the ballot box and signed on the voters' list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure in an unpopularly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest to the absence of envelopes at the beginning of voting, and that only envelopes of registered and duly authorized voters and delegates are added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under intensive supervision following specific procedures.

The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed while emergency services free the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh accused of murdering her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness may be questionable because her photo has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered that publishing the images is potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are definitely heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or the like of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service has indicated to journalists that there will be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over the border, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for 10 years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year presence.
The guards had to closely supervise the shooters in the supplemental pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia, qualified volunteers have been selected as part of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunt have received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
It's Martelli's fifth temporary election board in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure to hold elections, which had been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional burnout incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The department responded to Apple's call to delay the report as "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in Northern Mariana states that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a possible tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and took medicine as his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
He has shown through his research that when you give a hormone, it will accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the two flight recorders, or "black boxes", on Wednesday.
Luna was also praised by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons. A strong, unique woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was a freak like me...maybe more than me...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist's fitness has been called into question by his complaints. He was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three events at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take pain medication because it's banned in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth has formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political and ridiculous babble".
He's likely to run for president in 2016.
NexGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, plus there are no car parks, parking and ride facilities on the ground.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game could be forced behind closed doors, without fans present.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although it was thought that this process took much longer - due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the sharp-billed ground finch.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, it can be rolled and removed, it can be polished or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and glued onto another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called a chemical's pH, and you can make an indicator of that number using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Stir the dry powders together and squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel weird and form a kind of crust.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sanitation systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then reverses it almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically, but its most important contribution to us is that it has made transportation easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The lion family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Usually the females are closer together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group as the black, the spotted, and the Uyghur.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's full-throated roar, but it's more like shouting angry words.
Panthers like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that panthers hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that civets track and find prey using their sense of smell, sniffing out where they've been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily. Panthers hunt their prey by identifying with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) are separated from the main population to which they belong (for example if they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and different competitors, the new group will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than it needed to be before.
The natives haven't changed at all, so they still need the same ways of adaptation that we've used.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look too different to be called the same species.
We call this process the process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants as well. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-like teeth plus another set in the roof of her mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that stood in her way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and he may have been a carnivore.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't match it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual holiday items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a grasshopper.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they leaned on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple that served as the god's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs during ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard leading to a safe retreat that only priests can enter.
Sometimes unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter much.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street; stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
In the Norse sagas, it's said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimos once lived there.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this portion of text is not known for certain, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 in √ó 241‚ÅÑ2 in) was in folded storage early in its existence.
So, it's likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
Vichy France was ruled by these French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a community.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state.
Autonomous cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
Microcultures often vanish without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override state tax laws and tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all states before they could be amended and the states mocked the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, sledge hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's journey began way back in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as lha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Antihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio was inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm model is actually, confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this picture is (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the smallest integer) so it's going to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the Advanced Picture System format set, for example) equal or approximate this width-to-height ratio.
The misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in a clear image.
It is said that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European nations together for more than a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power she possessed affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church coffers exist specifically for that reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this focus on power and money has led many to question the extent to which it meets the requirements of dogma.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the blockade's violation of generally accepted international law that has been codified and coordinated in several international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, threatening even neutral ships.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid that situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each period of China or each dynasty that was in power was of a different type.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war arose between many nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while fighting for the highest seats in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political implications, like the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to the ruler alone.
Also, since the revolution, professions have been open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same thing applies to the military because instead of rankings being based on class, they're now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to unleash their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as Hira, atop Mount Noor for meditation.
The Ghar itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
And in fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world inside the cave can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century CE, the Great Pyramid is one of the massive pyramids built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "funeral city of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples and the Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
An upstroke looks like a V and a downstroke looks like a staple or a square without the bottom.
An upper mark indicates that you should start from the tip and push the bow, while a lower mark means that you should start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to draw your own marks in pencil, but remember that curved printed marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A crowd managed to force the king and queen to open their car windows wide.
One gang member once waved the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino people have borne the brunt of US imperialism's war in the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the main gains of US imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivated the organization, to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which generally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas common to most explanations of technological inevitability: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are embedded in, rather than linked to, society.
For example, one might say that a car engine necessarily leads to improved roads.
But building a nationwide road network doesn't make economic sense for a handful of cars, so new ways are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which leads to the development of new technologies in health care to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography arose, and these, as being in harmony with the place of the community, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its condition declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades returned bearing with them gifts such as silk and spices which were of higher value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that Paris, rather than Constantinople, became the capital of fashion.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
And yet, because of slow communication channels, patterns in the West can lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at the time was as a result of the Crusades people started using buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence farming system uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Most farmers, historically, worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are likely to be differentiated by age, race, class, location and/or gender of members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through different and symbolic uses of style that include clothing, costumes, and terminology.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse, from being socially disconnected by adults during their upbringing.
Some lost children have been imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced childhood abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) quite similar to those of a pet, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather an auxiliary tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and on the ground, and in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning in the program is supported internally and aims to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing and nurturing and nurturing, but they do.
We recognize that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Alternative care must provide all the essentials they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and ways of fulfillment.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of subtle facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
It even raises the idea that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals, like pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of Chinese variants: a latent group and a genetically expressed one.
Mutation adds new genetic differences, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive differences.
The processes of segregation and recombination make the variation random back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
And failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources were the proteins they could get from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are hard for primates to digest unless they're cooked like us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors somehow solved their "protein problem" the same way chimpanzees do on the savannah.
Sleep bruxism is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet stimulant to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positivity that life force gives. Everyone has the potential to find inner peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but it extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga and meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, a clash of regimes, procedures, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and it was supposed to be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the function of the navy has been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion with its strength in this use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Carriage roads were established in England as far back as the 16th century.
Although early railway carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull greater loads than roads that were considered more rugged at the time.
Railroads were invented relatively early to stabilize tracks, but then it became clear over time that putting a strip of iron above the track made it more effective.
This became a common practice, but iron further eroded the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first form of transportation, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright consistently.
Two-legged species have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although coelenthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems, and we have to end them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advancement, and the problems have become greater because of increasing population and man's luxurious lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to the John Dunlap Press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Critical Leaflets.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios represent the earliest surviving copies of the Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version was not intended to survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like dinosaurs.
By default, all computers in use today rely on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, if we use computer jargon.
An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting appear, which are sufficiently general.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs have long incubation periods, and are adapted to living in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to set up an adoption plan for their children.
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out the way the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only test that can be used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the existence of autonomic cycles and produced by biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclical signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that will continue for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into the spores.
They did two experiments to tag either the phages' DNA using radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including the wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about the Bornean orangutan.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work and on the way they meet other people working in the place they just left.
In this vibrant transportation movement, everyone is kind of supporting and connecting through a car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear in developed countries similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; with this, traffic has a reasonable consistency, and it can be mathematically approximated.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships were established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the earth move, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to 6 miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were unsurpassed in size and architectural excellence.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the relics of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most civil servants, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and all of these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle postulated that everything is composed of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are minerals, and then of course there are minerals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
And then, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and uses.
People are now typing messages on computer screens, without having to use a match.
And one can't help but wonder what the keyboard might look like when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by collecting energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy cart rolling up a hill, the nucleus splits again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side, 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner below Maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is less thick.
Content theories are about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously when they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two common content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One is an attempt to remain "like everyone else".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite extreme, the individual turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that he/she has to change everything that the group was doing and owning.
At the end of the day, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" was described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109) as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the management team, the Invisible Team, where the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create a learning organization when it is a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the purposes of applying organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across functional departments in an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be achieved.
As a result, synergies within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to new innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to the pursuit of knowledge, thereby shrinking the search area and making it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies is allowing us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain like never before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behaviour in a robotic manner.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things became separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher may like to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology enables the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to revisit a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to seek to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to feed the public's attention inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to material on the Internet, students can identify their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a range of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is in the far south, and to the north lies the beautiful, unspoiled natural home of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what outsiders see as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For comparison's sake, here's a demographic that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is the largest of all, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the African coast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of actual social status, women travelers must declare that they are married.
It makes sense to wear a ring, but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment and that it is common to stalk them, grab them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (don't let cultural differences make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called Anfa after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badiya, and the Spanish traders who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, shisha and all sorts of cheap goods, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which flooded most of the city streets, especially the city centre.
Any visits outside of Goma should be sought to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can ride a boda boda (a motorcycle that doubles as a taxi) around the city of Goma, and the typical price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides being relatively difficult to reach, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for foreign lands far away.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops on his PBS series on Africa's Special Wonders of the World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and its park is one of South Africa's national parks (South African National Parks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there is a daily entrance and maintenance fee.
It can be useful to buy a Wild Card, which gives you access to a selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider their kiss.
Hong Kong's skyline is lined with buildings that resemble a glittering chart rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon Waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it's estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses leave the inner station between areas (across the river) during the day although most, especially those heading east and Jakkar/Boomthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses within the regions are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Bonaha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and San Jorge de Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two tracks 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, at the same time that the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of a confrontation between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournaments of the year are held in December, on the polo grounds of Las Ca√±itas.
In addition, smaller leagues and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley on the other side of FIC West.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are often accepted.
On outlying islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners for acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so cash must be exchanged before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year, as there are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
And according to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors each year are injured because they don't keep a safe distance.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of infamous naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
She sank all but one British cruiser and nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Maoist struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
As a result of Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, allowing safe swimming, and most are shaded by botocoa trees.
Tamaki Road Beaches is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good selection of shops lining the shore.
The basic folk beer is known as "Number One", it is not a complex drink, but is a fun and refreshing drink.
French wines are varied, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more common.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find, if you're nervous.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is often topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent although expensive.
Many trips to the reefs take place throughout the year, and injuries to the reefs rarely occur for any of these reasons.
Nevertheless, ask the authorities for advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. It can sometimes be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't normally live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Although you may find that it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents have traditionally offered packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or buy other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should get in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may be over, there are sections of the festival that may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a lot of noise for the most affected people.
St. Petersburg cruises involve spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you would on smooth asphalt.
And during blizzards, enough snow can fall to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, ice storms, condensation, or ice on car windows can limit visibility.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most important activity for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to cross-country travel to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get quite close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions and leopards and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle walk" or "walking safari" or "hiking") consists of walking long distances, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations around Japan.
After hosting the 1964 Olympics, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were no longer in place until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with a typical regular ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer an iron and a drying table to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you prefer not to wear ironed socks, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not make the cloth too hot (which may cause it to shrink or burn in the worst case).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, consider buying your water in tightly sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping at a duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy goods tax- and duty-free at specific locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the earlier and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to them is more important than otherwise.
Strangely, though, cell service is stronger here than a lot of other places along the way.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are popular where apples are baked in pastries throughout the year while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Germans often eat folk cakes with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try the so-called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krappfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry, while in South India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, as there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia to differentiate between.
But if used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originated from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply spiced dishes. The predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his foot gets caught in the bridle, he may be dragged if the horse runs away.
First of all, most equestrians wear riding boots with soft heels and very tight soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the passenger's fur to fall off the saddle when pulled back as the passenger dismounts.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of walls and large granite boulders.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between the endless potential walls, where peaks include spectacular views from above.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a skateboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a large number of enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski nomads", who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skating is very old - cave paintings depicting skaters date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski trips or long-distance snowshoeing.
It is related to alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but does not usually involve ski touring or mountaineering, as they are practiced in steeply sloping terrain and require stiffer skis and longer boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you'll rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries means you have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area operates to some extent as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can cross the border normally without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than a hundred years old, but there's no universal definition of what we consider a manufactured item.

Because of the underwater terrain, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current to deep water may form there.
Most deaths are from exhaustion from trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you've swum out of the current, swimming back will be no easier than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be swept away again or, depending on your skills and whether someone notices you, waiting for rescue may be another option.

Please treat the site with the dignity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by putting signs or graffiti on the walls of buildings.
