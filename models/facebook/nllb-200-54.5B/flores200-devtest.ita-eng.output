While there appears to be an experimental vaccine that can reduce Ebola mortality, no drug has yet been found that has been clearly shown to be effective in treating the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal trials found it to be less effective than hoped in preventing deaths.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was used as a control, which means that the scientists used it as a reference and compared it to the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the critical need for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all of its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC has said, which is that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can best be served by driving meaningful change within our organization, not by decertification.

USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so athletes can pursue their dreams in a trusted, positive and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski was an advisor to John F. Kennedy and later to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the underside.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage lacks the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other features typical of feathers, barbs, and barbules, the researchers concluded that the spine probably evolved after these features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for courtship.
The researchers hypothesize that although the tail belongs to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

The luminosity is used together with the rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less the star's activity with respect to magnetic reversals.

The activity was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was thought to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth that generates tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

Glen Cushing of a team of astrogeologists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground".
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988 ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes other than those of duly counted and authorized voters are inserted.
Candidates can send their representatives to assist at every stage of the process.

Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She is being held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish law has different parameters, as Scottish courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspicious characters are walking through a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until formal charges are laid.
According to leaks, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
Shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely deplorable".
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management, no damage has been reported in the nation.
And furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Most of the hostages have been rescued, at least six are deceased.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then substituted for an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After training as a midwife, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began studying cases of preterm labor.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
Even his fellow wrestlers wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman".
"Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even weirder...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place", commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated her belief that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast, 29 percent of those polled said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent felt that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but suffered a number of ailments that led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to deal with the pain because it's banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter - matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life - to earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and, in particular, how the earth was formed by collisions with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "chatter and political nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete ground-based radar to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while on-site car parks or interchange car parks are not available.
Fears over the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
A new species of bird has been born on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this is due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a fine thread, suitable for twisting and braiding, and can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted onto other metals, and it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated codices because it could be made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the test chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been stripped (hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then roll them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
Between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will occur that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Nearly every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bath with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes incorporated into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or a telescope into space requires a rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the many advantages it has given us, the most important is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other modes of transportation appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a niche, a particular goal that each feline has and that enables it not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and up to 30 females and cubs.
Usually the females are closely related to one another, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pride acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even when it comes to deadly attacks on their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and exert a pulling force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but is more like a phrase of shouted, angry words.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals for food (prey) by scent, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
To hunt their prey, ocelots blend into their surroundings and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a possible return difficult), it will probably find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants process their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is made from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era, and because of that, it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
With over 70 razor-sharp teeth protruding from its long jaws, plus an additional row along the roof of its mouth, it was a formidable opponent.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex couldn't compete with it.
While many of their foods would be familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured a number of strange or unusual items, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to feast together lying on their sides while eating their meal.
Of course, ancient Roman meals did not include various foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
For each deity, the Babylonians built a principal temple, which was viewed as the god's dwelling.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to supply the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine to the god.
Because of the mild climate of the Middle East, a home was not of prime importance.
Much of a Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simple open-air stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so wood was especially expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and it's said in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red named it after his encounter with Greenland after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" appear upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, then, the annotation was intended only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, the French who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was named "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", meaning civil; the term is in turn related to "civis", meaning citizen, and "civitas", meaning city or city-state, and in some ways therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of the nation.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, relied on often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
Changes to the Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with Germany, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) make up Japan, making it the seventh-largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago" because of the island groups that make it up.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of the aborigines' grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still under way.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most commonly used at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective place to place the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, either vertically or horizontally (as in the example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite differences in language and custom.
Its pervasive power has affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of all essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company of New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between provinces, the best known being the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent times in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place of honor in Xi'an's mighty palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same is true for the military, since army ranks, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, in itself offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave sits on top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you knew it existed.
From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived intact.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication 'arched upwards' resembles a V and the indication 'arched downwards' resembles a paper clip or a square without a bottom.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the bowstring (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow toward you.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow produces a stronger, more decided sound.
You may decide to add your own personal notes in pencil, but keep in mind that the bow marks you find printed have musical significance, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women in the marketplace forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4), and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses incurred by US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of their expenses, and the interest on the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the basis of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily implies the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently to the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, discussed by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and in the course of time there arose customs, habits and culture linked to that geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its prestige declined, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles in the West may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the era, a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for tying clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming carried out for the sole purpose of producing enough food to meet the food requirements of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, whereas scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather an aid to those embarking on a new learning experience, such as using a new computer programme or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is Microsoft Office's little paper clip-shaped assistant.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt and explain procedures that the learner may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
A child should never have to grow up in an environment that doesn't provide them with nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We feel that foster care is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to make up for any needs not met in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships'.
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely latent variability and expressed variability.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In view of all of this, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberate awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by resumption of sleep (10-60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you will have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionately opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force that exists, each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focus of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and develops the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, soon proved obsolete, as more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the Navy has always been to ensure that the country can safeguard its ability to move people and goods, while countering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany probably would have had a chance to conquer Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by ancient cultures and tribes for their readily available milk, fleece, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite consisting simply of parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared with the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed horses travelling on them to reach greater speeds and to move heavier loads.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport known to man were legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate some of the suffering in the future, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even become activists.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant life-style of humans.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the assignment was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's 25 borders are the oldest known extant copies of the document.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive.
Many tend not to think of them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers is the basis of all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but its symptoms, including vomiting, are so general as to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of indoor poisoning may be an open container of medicine or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both assassin bugs and bedbugs are nest-dwelling, meaning that they are adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
With about 400,000 known cases in the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the number one neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West became isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behaviour are strongly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to periodic external signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells involved belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to offspring are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism refers to people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks, and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about Borneo's orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems, about which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about poor water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be generically represented mathematically.
In order to obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly enabled them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects alive today, the only ones that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, up to six miles wide in places.
Twenty percent of the total water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long and is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of grandeur and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the least populous.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since antiquity. These elements can be found in nature in native form and can be extracted fairly easily with primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually more closely resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minute amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Since its invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less and less use.
Today, everyone types messages on computer screens and never needs to be near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, so as you split the nucleus further, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no push.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on the search for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what makes them want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that make them do or not do certain things.
Popular content theories include Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two types of behaviour can emerge.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the whole way the team works and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This attitude often creates dissension between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place across different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The term "invisible team" refers to the management team to which each member reports and which sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation be willing to go through the long process of building a learning organisation?A good reason for implementing organisational learning concepts may be innovation.
When all available resources can be used effectively in all functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to call itself innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological findings have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition.
The link between brain disease and behavior is the focus of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumours can affect behaviour and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that have never been observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our own mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, speech and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an essential part of teaching, and teachers often want to take their pupils to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the nation's capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing, as their first experiences with blogging are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the author of the blog is committed to improving the writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to fuel the public's interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's picturesque, bilingual capital, filled with art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario uniquely Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The vast areas farther north are sparsely populated, some of them almost uninhabited wilderness.
If a population comparison is made, the result may be surprising to many: In the United States, there are more African-American citizens than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in itself.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which made the long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India opened the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: It is recommended that all travellers declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may give rise to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Badya, later renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajine, ceramics, leather goods, hookah and a lot of trinkets, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying many of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to research well before making any visits outside Goma in order to properly assess the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for trekking to Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the cheapest opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Partly as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but its reputation remains a tourist attraction, complete with an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stops.
With its more Arabian than African flavor, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and entrance to the park.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the whole territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a shimmering bar graph, made even more visible by the surrounding waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place that the British settlers chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove swath globally, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[1] The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain remnants of the massive jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is swampland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable, sturdy Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. The construction was finished in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and character.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Minor tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
The islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; temperatures over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are quite normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold - temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the impression of a lower temperature than the thermometer indicates.
There are no definite "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of man, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem - bison, elk, deer, bears - virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance.It is necessary to give these animals adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, bear in mind that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This harbor was the site of the infamous naval standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the paramount chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland lies between two harbours.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the fashionable suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops.
The most well-known local beer is an uncomplicated, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might be better for the trip.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea: 'espresso' is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the reef and accidents from one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear from October to April near the beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind that he will find a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is also possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees decide to camp on site as a crucial part of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, you need to arrive early and get a seat near the music.
Remember that after the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as ice crossing causes rather annoying noise for those most exposed.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa exemption (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money spent by their guests, and usually there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and keep them coming back.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or near-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and driving is not possible as it is on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you are stranded.
Precipitation and snow flurries, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors' vacations.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips overland, especially into the savannah, to see Africa's beautiful wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so they are best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking" safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your flight and accommodation bookings for 2020 were made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, in late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not common in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infection.
Infectious diseases themselves and dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive, as it often traverses isolated areas of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep inclines, narrow streets, and tight turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are decidedly lower than those applied in the preceding and following sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, though, the level of mobile phone coverage in this area is much higher than in other parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria farther south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available year-round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you would like to try small but tasty pastries, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either 'dry' or 'wet', depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally denotes foods originating from the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems because of the possibility of the rider's feet becoming trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the escaping horse.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially British saddles, incorporated safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in case of a fall.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs are carved.

Freestyle snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, involve sliding on snow using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and has many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as 'ski bums', who devote entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least as far back as the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is related to, but usually does not include, ski touring or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are right, you can cover somewhat greater distances than you can on foot, but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiers without a heavy backpack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries.Normally, to travel through several countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area operates more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, saving you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object to be an antique if it is at least 100 years old.
There are geographical differences in the definition of the age limit, which may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture behind this trade is also the basis for many other professions.
Even in the course of time, not all Sámi have always been involved in reindeer herding on a large scale; some lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.

For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Alerts are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
'adverse climatic event' means any climatic event which can be assimilated to a natural disaster;

Travellers are advised to inform themselves about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that is potentially a war zone must undergo vocational training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile Environments Course' is likely to turn up the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to have sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports free of gender (X) markings or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.

Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the screening process without having their privacy and dignity violated.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths result from fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to locate an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
Re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter time than culture shock (there being a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their country of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have met people who are patient and understanding, aware that travellers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not realize that patience and awareness are also needed by those returning to their homeland.
The pyramid's sound and light show is the area's main attraction for children.
Before the show begins, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
The sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with spring water to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 220-mile-long (360 km) chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (16,000 ft) with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only available alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you must be outdoors with a clear view to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including pleasure craft, as well as missions requiring remote voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, since they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the gap year can actually increase the chances of returning to higher education in one's home country.
Enrollment in these educational programs usually requires payment of a fee.
Finland is an ideal destination for sailing enthusiasts.In the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' there are also thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a stay of several days in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for disembarkation (as of 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of. It is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people have toward other things.
For some people, a little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Couriers are well paid for delivering products quickly, and timing is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow checked baggage without a passenger.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay handsomely for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to be paid is high: roughly, one can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business Class travel and up to eleven times the fare for First Class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a class of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.

All nouns, apart from the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form that stands for "She", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.

Since light pollution in their heyday was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending Easter night awake in an outdoor setting to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian springtime and fertility rite.
In the more traditional Churches an Easter Vigil is frequently celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the considerable distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun stays below the horizon.
This phenomenon makes it possible to see the northern lights, for the sky remains dark for most of the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
