This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a popular theory, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish above and pale or carotenoid below.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a fully developed bone chain, called a backbone, but had secondary characteristics of feathers - such as bumps and small projections - researchers concluded that the backbone was most likely an evolutionary outgrowth of these secondary characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but merely for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the tail of a juvenile.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers and not juvenile feathers.

Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were brought before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on trial for the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness may be questionable since her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in Britain but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have held that the publication of photographs can be biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that ""It seems to me that journalists are certainly taking a dangerous approach to publishing photographs or other images of suspects".""
The Crown Prosecution Service indicated to reporters that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment .
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an issue of importance to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pesticide experiment had to be closely supervised by guards, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is Martelli's fifth temporary council seat in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee served as Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have occurred over the failure of elections scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of crashes, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded to Apple's call to postpone the report as "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami wave.
A former Filipino policeman takes two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila , the capital of the Philippines .
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The cameraman later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and then started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
He has shown through his research that when a hormone is administered it accelerates lung maturity in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders or "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Our fellow wrestlers also praised Luna .
"Luna was my first drag queen"," said Tommy Dreamer. ""My first manager, Luna, died on the night of the full moon. She was a strong woman, like no other".
Dustin "Goldstein"" Runnels commented, ""Luna was as eccentric as I am ... maybe more so ... I love her and miss her ... I hope she's in a better place"."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed just before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should return to a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree with this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness has been called into question by his boredom, as he was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games.
He was unable to take pain medication because the use of such medication is prohibited in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using different hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source for delivering water to Earth as well as organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed from the collision of comets with Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo , 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage .
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and the underground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks, parking facilities or on-street parking.
Concerns about transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, with no fans present for the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was previously thought to take much longer - due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the sharp-billed ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and stretched. It can be rolled or wrapped in paper.
They could be made very thin, glued onto another metal, and could be so thin that they were sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It is called the pH of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator of this number using red grapefruit juice.
The color of cranberry juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-free protons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Flip the dry powder together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan townhouses on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women went together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then rebroadcasts it almost instantly .
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has dramatically changed the shape of the world; but providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains its most important contribution to us.
She bought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small mammals (including stray pet cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are highly social animals and live in large groups called prides.
A lion family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closer together, since they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly the animals are similar to lions (but not other large mammals) in behavior and very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, and leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the jaguar, and the leopard. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but it is more like a shout of angry words.
Panthers like to eat small animals, so they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all animals hunted by panthers are smaller in size.
Scientists believe that domestic cats track and locate prey using their sense of smell; they smell where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well with night vision, and their eyes are also mobile. Panthers hunt their prey by identifying their surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) becomes separated from the main population to which they belong (for example if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group requires different traits or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than the first.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they still require the same methods of adaptation as we have known.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans produce (exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants too. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-like teeth plus a second set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that stood in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and dinosaur eggs, and it was probably carnivorous.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual holiday items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a vole.
A second difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men liked to hold feasts together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and considered it to be the home of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs during festivals and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a safe room that only priests can enter.
Unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not of great importance.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was outdoors.
The women were cooking in the square; the shops were just open tables overlooking the street. The stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited sporadically. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes had lived there before.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that 's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known with certainty, we do know that the large manuscript (293‚ÅÑ4 in √ó 241‚ÅÑ2 in) was a folded storehouse early in its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still not free.
France was ruled by Vichy. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town-state, which is also loosely defined as a social mass.
Autonomous cities are like the progenitors of nations. The culture of a civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable distribution of knowledge.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override interstate taxation and tariff laws.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all states before they could be amended and the states resented the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, sledge hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan occupies, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan began way back in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the way indigenous grain was produced and recruited Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world's most common still photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
Their production has continued to the present day, but more importantly the shape of the image sensors in digital cameras has inherited their image width-to-height ratio.
The 35 mm model is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the smallest integer) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the Advanced Picture System format family) equal or approximate this width-to-height ratio.
Often misused and ridiculed, the rule of thirds provides a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining some order in a graphic image.
It is said that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power he possessed affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
A central Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church coffers exist specifically for this purpose.
The Church's central authority was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this focus on power and money has led many to question whether it meets the requirements of orthodoxy.
Britain soon began blockading Germany from the sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified and coordinated in several international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, threatening even the ships it had brought into the war.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China as a whole had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or dynasties in power was of a different type.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. One of the most famous of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there was intense warfare between various nobles for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in battles for the highest seats in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
It had many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to the ruler alone.
Also after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the army because instead of army classifications being based on class, they are now based on rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to foment their own revolutions.
The Prophet Muhammad had a strong interest in things beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor for meditation.
The Quran itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca , and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find even if you know where it is. Once you enter the cave, you are in complete isolation.
You can see nothing but a beautiful clear sky over the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century CE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramids built to house the tomb of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (most notably the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and a Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
An "upstroke" is shaped like a V and a "downstroke" is shaped like a staple or a square without a bottom.
A higher sign indicates that you should start at the tip and push the bow, while a lower sign means that you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more strident.
Feel free to draw your own markings in pencil , but remember that curved printed markings are there for a musical reason , so they should always be respected .
Horrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A crowd managed to force the king and queen to roll down the windows of their car.
A gangster once waved the severed head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino people bore the brunt of the U.S. imperialist war with its invasion of the Philippines.
These had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the principal gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, we need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the Order.
The era in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages and is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a trajectory largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on societies inherent, rather than associated with, society.
For example, one might say that a car's engine should have a road upgrade.
But building a nationwide road network is not economically viable if there are few cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, leading to the development of new technologies in healthcare to treat affected people.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being compatible with a society's location, were preferable to laws imposed by force.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its fortunes declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could bring.
It was at this time that Paris was dubbed the capital of fashion rather than Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period from the 10th or 11th century to the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, patterns in the West may lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of this time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use lace to bind clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture grown to produce enough food for only the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming - often without the use of fertilizers or pesticides - is a simple system using stored seeds adapted to the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Most farmers historically practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by various symbolic uses of style including clothing, costumes, and make-up.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the unfortunate few cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
These children are referred to as "wild" or feral. Some homeless children have been locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have been abused as children or suffered severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child's behavior (within physical limits) closely resembles that of a private pet, such as fear of humans or disregard for them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather an auxiliary means of providing support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real-time; in other words, a tutor is a form of interactive learning, as is a paper clipper in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning in the program is supported internally and aims to ask questions, stimulate, and explain actions that may be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without nurturing, care and education, but they do.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children .
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The alternative care must provide all the necessities they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage patterns and methods of fulfillment.
For example, some have suggested "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to Internet sites".
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks has pointed out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals, such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a latent group and a manifest group.
Mutations add new genetic variants, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive variants.
The processes of segregation and recombination keep the random variation between the two groups constant with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty obtaining the amino acids they need from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can also lead to serious consequences: poor growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins that we can get from plants and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide proteins in high amounts and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah.
Sleep paralysis is the process by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period and then fall back asleep within a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet stimulant that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely .
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you are sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
The second option, based on biorhythms, involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his or her body and mind.
The less stress you have, the more positivity your life force gives you. Everyone has the potential to find lasting peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment . The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity .
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the goddess Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, they cleanse the energy channels, activate the chakras, and create enlightened consciousness.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, and this caused the Soviet Union and the United States to struggle, but by the end of the war, a clash of regimes, actions, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had effectively collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, as more than 800,000 Red Army troops marched into the Soviet Union and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interdicting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
A notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy was trying to repel this invasion with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them because of easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railway carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speeds and to haul heavier loads than the more rugged roads of the time.
Rail tracks were invented relatively early to stabilize tracks, but it later became apparent that placing an iron bar on top of the track made it more effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the carriages to wear down further.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the earliest form of transport. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk in a straight line indefinitely.
Species with two legs have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Coelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering a little.
This is the same as treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want only a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have become greater because of population growth and humanity's increasingly luxurious lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
At night they printed between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the "Currency Bulletins".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the balcony of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and read to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios represent the earliest surviving copies of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is no longer extant.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don 't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly .
But there are so many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
It had webbed feet and claws, was oviparous, and walked on its hind legs like a pterosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Endotoxins may not cause symptoms immediately, and a prompt diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as rash are sufficiently general.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for instructions on a first aid kit for a specific poison .
Entomologists use the term "bug"" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, insects that are highly adapted to infest humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are characterized by long incubation periods, and are adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their children .
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not unique in this regard, an experiment is a test that can be used to test the validity of one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of self-cycles and produced by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclic signals, have been documented in most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillating that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first demonstrations that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted to label either the bacterial DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife, flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work and are met on the way by other people working in the place they just left .
In this dynamic mode of transportation, everyone supports and is connected in some way to a private car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this large carbon-based economy displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems . Everybody complains about transportation systems .
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, yet fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic has a reasonable consistency, which can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, they established relationships between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a larger variety of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot flap their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right and many thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
That makes sense , because you don 't feel the ground moving , do you ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching 6 miles in width.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza are unsurpassed in size and engineering excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most workers in the country, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these elements can be found in nature in native form and can be extracted fairly easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything was composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they transformed into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many more elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are, of course, minerals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Hence, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil was relegated to lesser status and uses.
People now type messages on computer screens, without needing to use a stylus.
And one can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
A fission bomb works by collecting energy to create a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It is like rolling a heavy car up a hill. The nucleus splits again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust reaches about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker at higher elevations.
There may have been more lunar maria on the near side because the crust was thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that automatically emerge when they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what makes some people desire the things they do and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two common content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
More generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead former peers: one is to try to remain "like everyone else" (or others).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
Conversely, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the group does and has.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same criteria of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical communities.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams as their teams may be assembled according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" has been described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109 as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the management team, the "Invisible Team". The "Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create a learning organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are utilized effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and efficiency can be achieved.
Because of this, collaboration within an organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before an organization is able to innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry. This narrows the search area and makes it much more precise.
Interactions between brain and behavioral pathology support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes of the brain as never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is currently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been used to create various software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher will want to take her students to places where bus transportation is not possible.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a good way to remember a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online as a registry.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins by improving his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to nurture public attention inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to online material, students can articulate their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada 's charming bilingual capital with a range of galleries and museums that showcase Canada 's past and present.
Niagara Falls is at the southern end, and to the north is an area of outstanding natural beauty that stretches to Moscow and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what outsiders see as quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost unpopulated.
For a population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African-American residents in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean just off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and is a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury coastal resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the African coast, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual social status, women travelers must declare that they are married.
It is better to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to stare, hold hands, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences make it unacceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port named "Anfa" after its founding by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as pots and pans, leather goods, shisha and all sorts of cheap goods, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city streets, especially in the downtown area.
Any visits outside Goma are worth researching in order to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can ride a boda boda (a motorcycle that doubles as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the typical price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides being somewhat inaccessible, "Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands.
Nowadays Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main locations for Henry Louis Gates' PBS special series on the Wonders of the African World.
The city is very different from the rest of the cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is also a major park of the South African National Parks (SANPs).
There are daily fees for maintenance and entrance to the park, as in all South African national parks.
It is better to buy a Wild Card , which gives you access to a selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks .
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be their hometown.
The rows of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering graph rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong , leave the island and walk to Kowloon Beach on the opposite side .
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest belt, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) through the coastal hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last remaining evidence of the dense forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses leave the inter-district terminal (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those to the east and Jakkar/Boomthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are usually full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" buses that are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Punahou (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and S√£o Jorge do Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The towers reach a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, at the same time that the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December, on the polo grounds of Las Ca√±itas.
In addition, smaller leagues and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound Sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island 's only bank located in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West store .
Pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted .
On the outer islands they may not accept credit cards, although they may accept British and American currency; check with the owners beforehand to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands , so you should exchange money before leaving the islands .
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed 30 ¬∞C in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the air colder than the thermometer reads.
The amount of precipitation remains approximately constant throughout the year, as there are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals may attack.
Many guests are injured every year, because they do not stay away, and these animals are big and wild and therefore dangerous so they must be given their own space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans were drowned.
During the Maoist-organized struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
Due to Auckland's location between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by baobab trees.
The Tamaki Road beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are often crowded with a good selection of shops lining the beach. Swimming is safe.
The basic folk beer is known as "Number One", which is not a complex drink, but a pleasant and refreshing one. A second local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more common.
The water from the local tap is perfectly safe to drink , but it is easy to find bottled water , if you are afraid .
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an espresso, while a cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards . The fruit juices are excellent , although a bit expensive .
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and damage to the reef rarely occurs for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will run away at the sight of one.
Saltwater crocodiles generally do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Although you will find that other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, can be booked through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even package deals that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain secondary documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site and consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action , you have to enter from the front to get to a campsite near the museum .
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stages may have ended, there are sections of the festival that may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children .
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing the ice can be very noisy for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include some sightseeing time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain an entry visa (see conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are often no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of keeping the gambler sober.
Everyone who drives at high altitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as you can on smooth asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, ice storms, condensation, or ice on car windows can cause limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to cross-country travel to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to vehicles and standard equipment allows good viewing.
Lions , leopards , and tigers are sometimes shy and can look cute in binoculars .
A walking safari (also called a "jungle trek" or "hiking trip" or "hiking") consists of walking long distances, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at secondary venues in different parts of Japan.
After Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympics, it became the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellations were not lifted until July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen with a typical regular price of about 7,000 yen .
A dryer helps wet clothes dry. Many hotels provide a dryer and a drying table for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there isn 't any coffee, or if you don 't want to use soda, then you can try using an air dryer, if one is available.
Don 't let the fabric get too hot (which could cause it to shrink or burn in the worst case).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, while in other areas you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter animal pests that are unknown in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain areas.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on spending on products such as alcohol and cigarettes.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is paramount.
Oddly enough, cell phone service seems to be much stronger here than in other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are popular where apples are cooked in pies year-round while cherries and plums are featured during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, and the special brownies are often eaten with a strong cup of coffee.
If you fancy some rich little pastries, try the so-called Berliner, Fankuchen or Krabben, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spices may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, due to Indonesia's 17,000 islands to differentiate them.
However, if used without additional terms, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of mildly spicy dishes. The predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanuts, basil, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse but has his leg caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged off by the horse if he runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with soft heels and very narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rails that allow the collar's fur to fall off the saddle when pulled back while the rider is getting off.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between seemingly endless walls, the peaks of which include spectacular views from above.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered slope on skis or skis attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity when traveling and many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skating is very old - cave paintings depicting skaters date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or snowshoeing.
It is related to alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but is not usually restricted to alpine ski touring or mountaineering, as they involve very steep terrain and require stiffer skis and longer boots.
Think of a cross-country ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking, but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and groomed trails.
Europe is a fairly small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means you will have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen Area operates more or less as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as merchandise more than one hundred years old, but there is no universal definition of what constitutes an artifact from manufactured items.

Transsexuals should not expect to undergo screening before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking on a beach, often at a coral reef or similar.
Because of the submarine terrain, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current to deep water may form there.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you've swum out of the current, swimming back should be no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won 't be swept away by the current again or, depending on your skills and whether or not someone notices you, waiting for rescue may be a second option.
Homecoming trauma occurs faster than culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.

While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland , where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the numbers are from one to forty).
Most luxury Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
