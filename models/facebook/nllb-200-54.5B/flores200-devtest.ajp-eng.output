This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already popular theory, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have determined that the feathers of this animal were brownish above with lighter-colored undersides or carotenes .
The discovery also provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called an axis, but had secondary feather traits - axons and ocelli - researchers concluded that the axes were most likely a later gradual evolution of these secondary traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although this tail is that of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of a large animal rather than chicken feathers.
Researchers have suggested that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.

The work I did was mostly theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The band effect has also been proposed to be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.

Scientists have been able to show that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo, composed of many small particles.

He was taken first to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth .
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on trial for the murder of her son.
She is being held pending charges and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness may be tainted because her photo has been widely circulated.
It is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered that publication of the photographs may be prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that ""a single journalist appears to be walking a fine line if he publishes photographs etc. of suspects".""
The Royal Court, which is responsible for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until an indictment is issued.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to the border dispute, which Palestine claimed was based on borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem as holy to both peoples and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control experiment had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, where the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's Hunting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage preservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEC) yesterday .
This is Martelly's fifth CEP test in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee outlined Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have erupted over failed elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports that no damage has been reported in the country .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami warnings.
A former Filipino policeman took two Hong Kong tourists hostage and hijacked their bus in Manila , the capital of the Philippines .
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 at the tourists .
We have rescued a good number of hostages and at least six are confirmed dead so far .
We were able to free six hostages , including children and teenagers , as well as the Filipino photographers .
Then the photographers took her to a place of her choice because she needed to use the bathroom . Then they drove to Mendoza .
Ligon followed his father's example and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligons began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research has shown that if we give a hormone it will accelerate the development of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Our fellow wrestlers praise her a lot .
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna died on a moonlit night. She was one of a kind, just like her. A strong woman"," said Tommy Dreamer.
"Dustin "" Goldust "" Runnels commented, ""If she was as scary as I am ... maybe more so ... I love her and will miss her ... I hope she is in a better place"."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of respondents share this view, and believe that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
As a final thought, 29 percent of those surveyed said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaint, his fitness was called into question.
He could not take medication for his pain and was prevented from participating in the games .
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, when comets struck the Earth in the past.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage .
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year while reducing carbon emissions.
Satellite-based technology is used instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is in operation and trains will not stop above ground at Wembley, and parking and ride-hailing facilities are not available above ground.
The public's fear of a lack of transportation also increased the possibility that the game would be forced behind closed doors without fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's sparrow and the Finnish migratory cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
We can make different shapes of gold . It can be rolled into small shapes .
It can be drawn into thin wires , which can be twisted and coiled . It can be drawn or rolled into sheets .
It could be made very thin and glued to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance . You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice .
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Stir the dry powder together and then squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had an elaborate bathhouse in almost every house, connected by a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in Minoan settlements on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back again , bit by bit .
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
This job required a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the bicycle has done is provide an easier and faster means of transportation.
She got us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below it are medium-sized lizards that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small lizards (including the popular pet lizard) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of status , a special function of each individual that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of birds, living in large groups called prides.
Broods consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty females and juveniles.
The women are usually close to each other , as they are a big family of sisters and daughters .
Lions behave proudly much like packs of wolves or dogs, and the animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Tigris) as lions, leopards and panthers. It is the only one of the four species that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but more like a series of chronic screams.
The axolotl likes to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the axolotl hunts are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that octopuses track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing out where they are on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and are also very stealthy. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking it.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) becomes separated from the main population from which it migrated (such as if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment that is different from what it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than what they needed before.
The indigenous population never changed, and the tribes needed the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two societies will look quite different and can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called diversification, and is only intended to produce new species. Diversification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and manufacture our food from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the most powerful predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with more than 70 teeth , plus another set with a finished roof , which means that nothing can escape in its path .
We do not know for sure, but it may have been a forked-toothed dinosaur. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, possibly cannibals.
It also attacked everything that went into the water . Even the giant dinosaur T. rex was not in the zoo .
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had strange or unusual holiday items, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a vole.
The other difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to sit together and rested next to each other while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman diets did not include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
I mean, for example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans had no taste for turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods which was considered the home of the deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special place for God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not very important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the square; the shops were just open counters facing the street. The stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan , so wood was very expensive .
Greenland was briefly settled. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Grønland.
Regardless of its discovery, however, it was inhabited by Eskimo tribes at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were considerable differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure , you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence .
However, this is not accurate. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears below the document upside down.
While no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that in its early life, the large manuscript document (measuring 29 inches by 24 inches) was wrapped for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that they simply added the encoding as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles led to northern France being liberated, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by Vichy France. These were all Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion code-named "Operation Dragoon I".
In just two weeks, Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is an individual culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a cooperative, community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin cives, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines in part the size of a society.
States or cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilizational culture is the transmission of knowledge across generations, with a lasting cultural imprint and equitable distribution.
Secondary cultures often disappear without relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies first formed a weak central government - Congress was its only component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its actions.
It also has the power to override interstate taxation and tariff laws .
The documents required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, one of the most successful teams in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's archipelago, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as "one archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, and began shifting native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which they ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the prevalent film size at the end of the analog film era.
They are still produced today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been improved by digital camera image sensors.
The 35 mm format is really a confusing affair, with a width of 36 mm and a height of 24 mm.
So they say that the ratio of width to height for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3: 2.
Many popular formats (the APS format family, for example) are roughly equal to or close to the width-to-height ratio we discussed.
The misused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in the image.
The rule states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see this example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity bound European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church coffers exist primarily for this purpose.
Central authority had belonged to the Church in Rome for over a thousand years, and the amount of power and money they had made many question whether this principle had been seriously adhered to.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved successful, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering certain parts of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former business manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or dynasties was a distinct dynasty.
Also within each dynasty was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, there was a fierce war between various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died while sitting on the highest bench of the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism and the belief that the state belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution, the professions were open to all young applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the army because instead of being based on class, army ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to go to a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor (meaning light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The location of the cave is on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Frankly speaking, it is not easy to find it even if one knows of its existence. Because once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above and a few surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen from outside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Funeral City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and a Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "uppercase" is like the letter V and the symbol for "lowercase" is like a leading element or a square minus its bottom edge.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow , and bottom means you should start at the frog (where your hand touches the bow) and pull the bow .
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to make your own marks in pencil , but remember that the printed cursive marks are there for a musical reason , so you should respect them .
The terrified King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young sons (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, due to a large influx of female shoppers.
In a car, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by crowds of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A crowd forced the king and queen to open all the windows of their carriage.
On one occasion a member of the audience waved the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Philippine people themselves paid the war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits to be made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be a major gain for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to their creation.
The era in which these events took place is referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technological drive or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path in which it significantly exceeds cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "unitary effects" on inherent societies, rather than being socially determined.
That is to say , for example , one could say that the automobile makes road improvements necessary .
However, the national road network was not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars increases the rate of road accidents, leading to the development of new technologies in health care to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture developed in relation to this geography, and these, in harmony with a society's location, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed rules.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance declined in the 12th century mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, patterns in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of this time was as a result of the Crusades when people started using buttons to tie their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds indigenous to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated from societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often identify their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, behaviors, and polemics.
One very common method used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on a few unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their development.
These children are referred to as "wild" or "feral". Some children are locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases this is abandonment due to the parent's rejection of the child's significant mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that the animals raised the twins; some of them are said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child will display behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of the animals it is raised with, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scales go much further than that.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an auxiliary tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new business.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical, in other words, a mentor is a form of scaffolding that is also a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolds component of the program aims to ask and answer questions and explain procedures that may be difficult for a student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
I don 't see any child growing up in an environment where they are not nurtured and educated and nurtured and educated , but I do see them that way .
We know that the nursery system is a safe environment for these children .
The foster care system should provide safe homes, friendly caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The adoption agency is supposed to provide all the necessities needed by the families from which they were taken .
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage patterns and satisfaction.
For example, "learning"" and ""socialization"" have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""continuing relationships"" were also added as new motivations by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording allows us to discover important things by interpreting subtle expressions and facial movements that last a few fractions of a second .
In particular, they say that one can tell if a person is lying by interpreting subtle expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks demonstrated in his paper "The President's Speech" how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
It has even been suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation introduces new genetic variation, thereby determining the range of variation expressed.
Segregation and recombination reverses the difference back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Also, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources are the proteins that can be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for most primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest and digest, but also provide high amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein first problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you are sleeping , you can put it on the other side of the room , so that you will have to get up from the bed to turn it off .
Other diet-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a common diuretic) before bed, followed by forcing the person to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his or her body and mind.
The less stress there is, the more positive life force there is. Everyone has the potential to find peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment . The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is stress and negativity .
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded through the Mahayana path of love and various forms of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. As the war ended, clashes of order, method, and culture led to the breakup of states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for 40 years and be fought virtually, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan and Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were completely collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interdicting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One recent example worth noting was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines primarily, was trying to stop the movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the system of herding now known.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts were just parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than those used on the rougher roads of the day.
Crossties were introduced somewhat earlier to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if a piece of iron was placed on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused corrosion of the wooden wheels of carts.
Eventually, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron ones. In 1767, they built the first complete railroad.
The earliest known form of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Two-legged forms have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the coast was walkable by seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become active in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we only provide a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and we must prevent it.
It is clear enough that the world has changed greatly because of humanity's scientific and technological advancement, and the problems have become greater because of humanity's increasing population and expensive lifestyle.
After it passed Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night approximately 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlop Boundary".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall Square on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap folios are the earliest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs lived and is alive today. They are birds.
Many people think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have two legs with claws and claws , lay eggs , and walk on their hind legs like a T. rex .
Almost all computers in use today rely on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer parlance.
Internal poisoning can be severe. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check and pay attention to the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a more formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to infest humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are friendly insects, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of the child, to raise it.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their children .
In the process of adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that other spouses can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This is how most scientific research is conducted.
However, it is not the same thing as an experiment, which is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations, as in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend on the presence of internal cycles and are produced by biological clocks.
We have recorded the circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, of most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The circadian clock is an internal oscillator that continues for a period of time during freewheeling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments have been conducted to identify DNA in bacteria using radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur protein.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells can only be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism refers to people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including its wild flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and identifying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to their workplaces and see others whose destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation future, everyone is connected in some way by a transportation system that relies on and supports private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or broken bridges are seldom heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems work the way they do, yet fail on a daily basis? Do transportation engineers understand this? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually operate within a reasonably regular range; therefore, traffic flows usually have a fairly reasonable symmetry and can be approximately represented by mathematical equations.
To better represent the flow of traffic, we made associations between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wide variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense , because it doesn 't feel like the ground is moving , does it ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, some six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that pours from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although they continued to build pyramids in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza are unsurpassed in size and engineering excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that all things are composed of a combination of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they could be converted into new substances to form what is observed.
Lead is basically a mixture of one or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. Of course, there are also minerals such as silver and gold.
You can also get spikes containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Well , the pencil was a good companion for most people when they were growing up .
Unfortunately, when new methods of writing appeared, the pencil was neglected for less space and uses.
People are now typing messages on computer screens , without having to ask permission .
One can only ask how he feels about the keyboard when something new comes out .
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with protons and neutrons.
Then roll a lightweight cart up the hill. Splitting the core again releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to decay with little or no propulsion.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level and thicker below the highlands .
There may have been more lava nearby because the crust is thinner . It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface .
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or like them.
These theories hold that people have certain needs and/or desires that they acquire as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at how certain people are influenced by things they do and by things in their environment that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to dominate their former peers. One of the two ends of the spectrum tends to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything about the group to belong to Elo.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often led to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same criteria of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, meaning that their teams can meet in different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "single invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the virtual group.
An "invisible" team is a management team in which each member is subordinate to God. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively by the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the organization's process can work together to overcome an obstacle by leading to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. This narrows the field of research and makes it more rigorous.
The relationship between neuropathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and examine structures and processes in the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation in science fiction, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as to recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been incorporated into many computer software applications and home video games.
School trips are a big part of any class. Often, teachers like to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Participating in a field trip is often a good way to reflect on the trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and redesign the website each year, but keep the older versions online as a sort of memoir.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Students often start their blogs with poor grammar and spelling, while the general public does not.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins by seeking to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interest allows students to be smart and funny (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can allow students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can determine their attitude toward other people's writing as well as determine their own views on certain issues"" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada 's charming bilingual capital and is home to a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada 's past and present.
Farther south at Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what the West considers quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
Comparing populations, this will surprise many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and is a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, largely conquering the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Coast Range, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable to tell any traveler that you are married regardless of your actual marital status.
It is also a good idea to wear a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to follow them or hold their arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men , and don 't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not , it doesn 't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Egyptians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Throughout the old city, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as crockery, pottery, leather goods, shisha, and a whole range of jigsaw puzzles, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano which flooded most of the city streets, especially downtown.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, we should look for any visits outside Goma to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and is one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma . The normal (local) fare is about 500 CFA for a short trip .
Because it could not be transported, Timbuktu was used as a gateway to foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the stations featured during Henry Louis Gates' PBS series The Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country , as it is more Arab than African in character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is one of South Africa's largest national parks (Sunparks).
As with all national parks in South Africa , there are maintenance and daily park entrance fees .
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card , which provides admission to a selection of South African parks or all South African national parks .
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is where many tourists consider the main hub.
The procession of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong resembles a bright ribbon-like pattern that can be seen through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong , leave the island and go to the opposite Kowloon waterfront .
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is arguably the world's largest coastal mangrove forest belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are some of the last remaining examples of the mighty forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Inter-district buses leave the station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those to the east and Jakar / Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are usually full , it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance .
Most areas are served by small , comfortable , and reliable Japanese buses .
Shuttle buses are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places , such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Loyapoque in French Guiana.
The towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs checkpoints have been cleared.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadores with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas .
Small leagues and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year .
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can exchange your money at the island 's only bank located in Stanley across from the FAC West store .
Pound sterling is accepted everywhere on the islands , and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are widely accepted .
Credit cards may be accepted on the outer islands , although they do take British and American currency; so check with the owners before you go to determine which payment method they accept .
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands , so change your money before you leave the islands .
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. So in the summer months, temperatures can be above +30 °C.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer says.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities , stay at least 100 yards / meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards / meter away from all other wildlife !
Regardless of how vulnerable they are to attack, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of infamous naval confrontations in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All the ships were sunk except one British warship. About 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of paramount leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland straddles two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are often crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer, but it is fun and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are a lot of French wines one can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but the water fountains are easy to find if you are scared.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with a heavy layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards . The fruit juices , although more expensive , are excellent .
Many trips to the reef are seen throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes of coral bleaching are rare.
However, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the shores and near estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s. They can sometimes be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels , although you can also find reservations for other types of accommodation , such as campsites , through a travel agent .
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast , transportation to / from the airport or even shared airline and hotel packages .
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or arrange other paperwork for your trip (such as a visa).
However , you should check any changes or requests through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel .
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event , you should arrive early to get a campsite near the concert .
Keep in mind that even though the music in the main theaters may have ended , there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night .
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children .
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in the winter , check the cabin location , as walking across the ice is very noisy for people who are more affected .
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by the customer . There are often no windows or clocks , and it is difficult to find an exit .
They usually have special food , drinks and entertainment , to keep visitors in a good mood , and to keep them in the building .
Some places serve alcoholic beverages in the evenings. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads , there is little friction and you cannot drive as steeply as on unpaved asphalt .
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to leave you stranded in a very short time.
Visibility may be limited by falling or melting snow or by condensation or ice on the windshields .
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic can continue largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important for many visitors.
The term safari travel is commonly used to refer to overland travel to view spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals , such as elephants and giraffes , tend to get very close to cars , and standard equipment will allow good viewing .
Sometimes lions , cheetahs and leopards are shy and you can see them better in person .
A walking safari (also called a "push walk", "walking safari", or "walking tour") consists of a walk of either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having done so in 1964.
If you book flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced , you may find yourself in a difficult situation .
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen , with standard tickets costing about 7,000 yen .
An iron can help dry wet dishes . Many hotels offer an iron and ironing board to borrow , even if no one is in the room .
If an iron isn 't available , or if you don 't want to wear ironed socks , you can try using wristbands , if available .
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or burn in extreme cases).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness , and if you have any concerns , you should consider buying water purifiers from a reputable company .
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
A duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is considered the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it frequently passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads , be careful: most of the way there are steep slopes , narrow lanes and sharp curves .
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is more important than anything else.
Oddly enough , cell service is much stronger here than on many other stretches of highway , such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike .
German pastries are very tasty, and in Bavaria they are as rich and varied as those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are popular; apples are baked in the cakes year-round, and cherries and peaches appear in summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Folk cakes are often closely associated with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small , filling pastries , try the local Berliner , Bacon , or Krabby Patty .
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, milk is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simple dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's two legs that swing down on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of two riders being trapped inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his leg gets caught in the stirrups, he may be dragged if the horse runs too far. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions may be taken.
First of all , riders wear riding boots with heels and soles that are soft and almost snug .
Additionally, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the skin of the rider to slip off the saddle if pulled back by a passing rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing area, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
The peaks have breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes between its endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", planning to spend an entire skiing vacation at a particular resort.
The idea of skating is very old - cave paintings depicting skaters date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking and skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or snowshoeing.
It is related to, but usually does not include, alpine ski touring or mountaineering, as the latter is performed on very steep terrain and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking - but you will rarely get cross-country speeds without a heavy rucksack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through different countries means having to go through visa applications and passport control many times.
