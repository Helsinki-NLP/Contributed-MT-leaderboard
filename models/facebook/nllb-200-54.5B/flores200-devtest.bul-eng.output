Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's now widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally don't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's upper feathers were chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed handle, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - branches and hooks - the researchers conclude that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. According to the researchers, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage, not chicken down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in the form of a halo and is made up of many small particles.

Traditionally, voting in France has been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, designate their preferred candidate on a pre-printed sheet of paper and place it in an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he or she places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.

In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they circulate photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of criminal prosecutions, told reporters there would be no further comment until charges are filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
It is assumed that other topics covered are the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both parties, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel requested a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely supervised by rangers as the test was being observed and its efficacy assessed.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the Shooting Sport Association of Australia's hunting program in partnership with the NPWS and the Shooting Sport Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received detailed safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in by the nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth temporary election board in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October was the commission.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, with reports of overheating causing a total of six fires and light burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay of Apple's report "a real regret".
Mariana was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are now at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
She trained as a midwife and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time.
His research shows that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate fetal lung development in the baby.
Government investigators recovered two flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Luna was also honored by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman".
"Luna is as weird as I am...maybe even weirder...I love her and will miss her...hopefully in a better place", commented Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Ultimately, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have put his fitness in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to deal with the pain because it was forbidden at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25th discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed after comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There's speculation he'll run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and pinpoint the exact location of aircraft.
There is no additional transport and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no on-site car park or parking facilities.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A new species of bird has emerged on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, reports a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the midland finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn as a thin wire that can be braided and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It could be drawn very thin and glued to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is the pH of a chemical, and by using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is, cabbage juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you'll feel it a little weird and it'll form a kind of a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected by an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women in mixed company gathered together.
You use a satellite to call someone who's thousands of miles away.
A satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly bounces it back.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of the light and distorts our view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that we have because of the bicycle is much easier and much faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are very small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat occupies that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three adult males related by blood, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit poorly), swim, leap great distances, and pull with the strength of five able-bodied men.
Along with lions, leopards, and jaguars, the tiger is one of only four big cats known to roar.
A tiger's roar is not quite like a lion's roar but is more like a roaring, screaming word.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, sniffing out where they've been on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very quietly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that returning is difficult), it will often end up in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of our food comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could match it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some very strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, lying on their sides while they ate.
It's not possible for ancient Roman dishes to have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a principal temple, which was viewed as the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just shelves facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each of the countries was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.
You might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie National Treasure.
This is not a treasure map, although there is something written on the back of the document.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early on, after it was created, the large parchment (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is most likely that the notation was only added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, northern France was liberated, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
Within just two weeks, American and French forces were liberating southern France and marching into Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a significant and large group of people working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civilian", related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas", which is "city" or "city-state", and that sort of defines the size of a society.
City-states were the predecessors of nations.Culture in the context of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and natural diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had no national judiciary or executive branch, it relied on state agencies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all of its acts.
It also has no authority to overrule tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states to be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Along with the Germany national football team, the Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical concept, it is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa", or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes to local grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the sensor image formats of digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
The ratio of the sides of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer denominator) is therefore 3:2.
Equal to or very close to this ratio are very common formats (e.g. a group of APS formats).
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the best location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photograph into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, already wealthy and powerful, was under attack.
The Christian religion has bound European countries together for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A basic Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church funds exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the Church continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been respected.
Britain began a naval blockade of Germany soon after the outbreak of war.
Although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in several international agreements of the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, an attitude of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid war in the future.
To accept a job with the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time; for each period of history or for each family in power, there was a separate dynasty.
Between every two dynasties there was also an unstable time of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people died fighting to sit atop the magnificent Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the classes were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
Same goes for the military, because instead of the division in the army being based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life, and to meditate, he often visited a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur.
The cave itself, having survived time, conveys a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
There's nothing to see except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many mountains surrounding us.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still in existence.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor a deceased pharaoh.
In Egypt's Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid honors the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples honor his wives and family members.
The 'bow-up' sign looks like a V and the 'bow-down' sign looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and press the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and then pull it out.
An upward-pointing bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward-pointing bow is louder and more confident.
Feel free to put up your own signs, but remember that the printed bow strokes are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women in the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd who shouted and screamed threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved to the horrified queen the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The Filipinos themselves have paid the military costs of American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines.
The U.S. colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the cost and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The super profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, a major asset of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The true Middle Ages were preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technologies themselves proceeds in a way that far transcends cultural or political influence, or that technology itself affects inherently rather than socially determined societies.
For example, one could say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership has also led to a higher incidence of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, pioneered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and they, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its glory as an epicenter of luxury dates from about 400 BC and lasts until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silks, which were more highly prized than those offered in Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was very much influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to button their clothes, which was one of the great developments of the time.
Subsistence farming is farming which is carried out for the sole purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Market farming is a simple, often organic system, often using preserved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used means of illustrating the importance of socialisation is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, ill-treatment or deliberate violence, were not socialised by adults during the children's formative years.
Some untamed children were kept captive by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to rejection of a severely mentally or physically disabled child by the parents.
Feral children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular foster animal, as well as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a training method, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, like the little guy with the paper clips in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons that are meant to ask questions, remind and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing and nurturing and nurturing, but it happens.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, as well as reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide everything they need that was missing in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet bring additional dimensions to the use of the accrual approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his book The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks points out that despite the fact that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive sincere attitudes.
He even suggested that similar abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Studies in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be protein from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but these are difficult for us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" the same way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking you up during your usual sleep time and going to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that can bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn the clock off in your sleep, you can place it across the room, thus forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or a tea known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is in inverse proportion to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and our own tension and negativity is the only thing standing in our way of achieving that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it's continued by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations and mantras.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, and by visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment of the mind is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, and there's a real battle being fought by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and revise their organization.
These plans, however, were invalidated almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move vast numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the last and most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans were trying to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed over hills or other pastures, often accompanied by kids, who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails were simply parallel strips of timber, they allowed horses to travel faster and carry heavier loads than the rougher roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realised that rails would be more effective with an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, didn't usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally conscious lives, join environmental movements and even become activists to reduce some of the negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant life-styles of humans.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 one-sided Dunlap copies on large sheets still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for birds that still look like dinosaurs, there's a lot.
They have legs with claws and scales, they walk on their two hind legs like T. rex, and they lay eggs.
Almost all computers in use today operate by manipulating information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always show up right away, and symptoms like vomiting are too common to diagnose right away.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term bug is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both flying and common bedbugs are colorless, living in the nest or home of their host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents' parental rights are terminated, after which the other couple can be the child's parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method.
It is not just experimentation, although experiments are used to eliminate some of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers worked mostly with classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
One of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material was the experiment done by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they tagged either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive to people with an interest in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife.
Activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo is one example.
Every morning, people commute to work from small country towns in their cars, passing others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is to some degree connected to and maintains a transportation system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that had supported human evolution for the last two million years is now being shown by science.
Every person is a part of society and uses transportation systems.
Rarely in the developed world have there been so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such advertisements, why do they break down on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, as driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus traffic flows have a certain logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
In order to better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three basic characteristics (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed are defined.
These links assist in the planning, design and ultimately the operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects alive today that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people think that he is right, but many hold the opposite view - that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in places.
The Amazon provides as much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the quest for stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical superiority of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the least populated and smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All subjects of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity because they can all be found in nature in a natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to shape what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals.
Metals are considered elements like calcium and potassium, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter, and matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when it first came out, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens and they don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A plutonium bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill and then splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to decay with little or no impetus.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 45 miles thick on the near side and 60 miles thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may have been more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness focus on discovering what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory of motivation are the two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, once managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviours are likely to emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "I'm one of our boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty disciplining, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
You become, at the other end of the spectrum, an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often creates a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports, and this team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and invention can flourish.
As a result, the organisation's workflow to overcome a barrier may lead to a new innovative process in service of the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, its leaders need to create a culture of innovation as well as organisational learning and shared knowledge.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that is used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to exploring cognition is provided by neurobiological data, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence features heavily in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science dealing with machine learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such problems have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system, which is embedded in several home computers and video game software applications, is already widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Excursions are a big part of the school curriculum.Very often the teacher would like to take his pupils to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year that website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketchbook.
While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog, in order to avoid criticism, began to strive to improve his writing.
Also, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture an audience's interest inspires students to be interesting and smart (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, 'students can be enabled to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material in the context of other people's writings, students can define their own positions and also outline their own views on particular issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming and bilingual capital, home to a number of art galleries and museums that will give you an insight into Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding lands.
All of these things establish Ontario as a model of what is typically Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas in the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabitable deserts.
A population comparison that surprised many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and it's its own continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it became a major influence in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope, the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to situations that they perceive as harassment, where they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Beida, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets and especially the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu", coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has gained currency as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has become a tourist attraction because of its reputation and has an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS show "The Special Wonders of the African World".
The city stands out from the rest of the country because it has an Arab rather than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends east along the border with Mozambique, to the north is Zimbabwe and the Crocodile River is its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km2, divided into 14 separate ecozones, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Usually all South African national parks require daily fees for entrance and conservation of the park.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which gives access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering colonnade that juts out over the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists claimed, and if you're looking for evidence of this territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and this part of the forest, which is on Indian territory, is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, almost a third of which is covered by water and swamps.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakhar/Bumtang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of travelling short distances, such as to Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with 2 sails with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous tribe in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who have survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley against FIC West's shop, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are commonly accepted throughout the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within Stanley credit cards.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, but British and U.S. currency may be used; talk to the hosts in advance to find out which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer.
There are no special "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the National Park Service, bears and wolves must be kept at least 100 yards away and all other wildlife within 25 yards.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, but these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't invade their personal space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
The harbor was the scene of an infamous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town ends with the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Oakland straddles two harbors, there are many beaches, but the most popular are in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are protected sandy bathing beaches and most have shade under the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are off the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St Heliers areas of Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a heavy beer, but is pleasant and refreshing. "Manta" is the name of the other local beer.
There's a lot of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian might be better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're afraid.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians - the short black is espresso, the cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are year-round, and accidents on the reef for any of these reasons are rare.
Still, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you can also find other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages including breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any amendments or requests should first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stages may be over, there may be festival stages that will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special campsites for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because for those most affected, crossing ice makes a pretty awful noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible.
To keep guests happy and entertained, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who must drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive like you can on smooth asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to strand you.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icing and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic moves almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and are the ultimate goal for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to a journey overland to view the amazing African wilderness, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the cars and you get a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and easier to see with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a 'wilderness walk', 'tourist safari' or 'walking') is a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will take place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, following its hosting of the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement of the season was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed even if there are none in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Do not allow the tissue to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
Water can be treated in a variety of ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter vermin unknown in their homelands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or at worst cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals in themselves that can seriously injure or kill humans do not normally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated outlying areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: Steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or following sections, where they are usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to them is, however, more important than elsewhere.
Curiously, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, similar to those made in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples served year-round and cherries and plums enjoyed in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krappen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without further qualification, the term usually refers to the dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes many simple spicy dishes, and the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer are chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns can arise due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming stuck in them.
In the event of a rider being thrown from a horse and having his leg caught in the stirrup, he will be dragged if the horse escapes.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley, Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with an abundance of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly carving new routes through the endless potential of the walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, more commonly known as 'ski boomers', planning entire ski holidays in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded Australia's first skiing club.
Ski touring: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski tourism.
It is similar to, but usually does not include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done over steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking - but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean multiple examinations of visa applications and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
While you are in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen Member States, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items more than 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered antiques even though they are not as old as antique mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this livelihood is also important to many other crafts.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but survived by fishing, hunting and the like, with reindeer being predominantly draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions, and tourism is a profitable industry in Sampi, one of the Sami areas.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate representations of the Romanian people.
If the country you are visiting is listed in a travel information bulletin, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult with other governments, but the advice of those governments is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.

The opinions presented are often superficial, general and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social problems or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and can vary greatly depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, tidal waves, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather includes blizzards, snow, ice and sandstorms.
Travellers need to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Any person planning to visit a country that may be designated a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company is likely to be provided in an internet search for 'hostile environment course'.
The course usually deals with all the issues discussed here, but in much more detail and usually in combination with practice.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first-aid activities, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Passengers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they carry valid documents on their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports to persons with an undefined gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents is also variable.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people undergoing surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the shore, often at a reef or something like that.
The reverse flow, due to the underwater topology, is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and there can form a fast current to the deep water.
Most of the deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which is probably impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't be caught again, or you may want to wait for rescue, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
Return shock occurs more quickly than culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have had a relatively easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, where you have adapted to a new culture, you have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first moved abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, realizing that newcomers have to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the story of light and sound is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are represented on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is the largest island.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, which has a spectacular natural harbor because of the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then rise again to form the 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, carved by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Vinson Peak reaching 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, your only option may be a satellite phone.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and in direct line of sight of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice data.
More information on how to contact this service can be obtained from your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
It's especially popular with high school seniors, giving them a year off before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the missed year would improve your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
There is usually a "tuition" fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't have to have a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is 1 to 40).
Most reputable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

If you go ashore using the excursions organised by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Berlin, Germany are featured in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or have not flown before.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and hatreds of other things that a very large number of people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies this has been a problem.
If they sent things by air, some routes can take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to expedite the process was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations prohibit the sending of unchecked baggage, such as yours.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
This, however, is not cheap: in principle, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to look for business or first class discounts on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of going somewhere quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the secession of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which, although it has its own government and currency, is not recognised by any UN Member State.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of about 3.7 million people, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains, the once ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city's atmosphere is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because by law it is the first official language.

The Parisians' shocked appearance would quickly evaporate if you showed some courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has dense forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir with mixed alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.

The area is also home to a remarkable variety of animals and birds.
You can see rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and dandelion, along with many other common species
While visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide robes for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun right at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
Clothes can be borrowed from the collection at the entrance, but they are not washed after every wear, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
As in similar areas in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
An example of a popular meal, especially in the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available product such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.

These pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and are now used as museums or educational facilities.
Because light pollution even in its heyday wasn't as big a problem as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on campuses, and they're more easily accessible than the ones built today.
Most modern survey telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.

All the animals that arrived on the islands originally came here by swimming, flying or sailing.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the first herbivore on the Galapagos.
After humans came to Galapagos, many mammals were brought there, such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
