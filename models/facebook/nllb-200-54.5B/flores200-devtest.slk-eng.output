Not only does this confirm the now widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, but it also provides details about which fossils generally could not have been, including color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was a fiery chestnut above and a pale or carotenoid below.
The find also provides a detailed look at the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called the rachis but have other features - spines and rays - scientists have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship.
Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the scientists believe that the feathers on the specimen are those of an adult and not of a juvenile.

The work they did was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The phenomenon the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have found that the interaction of one dark matter particle with another is the same as that of ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain relatively constant temperatures, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team, also at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally low-tech: voters went to a separate area and placed a pre-printed sheet of paper with their candidate's name in an envelope.
Once the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has a fairly strict codification of the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those put in by duly certified and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the entire process, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision in accordance with special procedures.

Following the signing of the agreement, Israel has a requirement for a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while Palestine agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary test against pests should have been under the strict supervision of foresters as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting park director for conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the pre-arranged resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been held since 2011.
Some 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, the government agency METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
According to the ruling request, ASI's and AOE's Irish branches are taxed on their worldwide profits.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
According to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there is no indication that a tsunami will occur.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Along with the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Then the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that administering the hormone would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two flight recorders, the so-called "black boxes".
Fellow warriors also paid homage to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager. She died on the night of two months, which, like her, was quite original. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "The moon was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I'll miss her... hope she's okay up there".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard communicated her belief that Australia should become a republic following the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agreed that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised questions about his fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because it's forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
By early February, several people had confirmed the invention using different hardware and software, with this being announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic materials that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described gossip as "political drivel and folly".
Former Head of the Federal Migration Service office for Sevastopol.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no other transport available, the overhead trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
Published Thursday in the journal Science, the study reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species of animal was able to evolve in just two generations - although it was believed that the process would take much longer - by crossing the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, with the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways, such as by being rolled into small coins.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called a pH chemical, and the indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together and then form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will start to react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and the formation of a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every home.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in Greek Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini.
In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in mixed company.
To talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call, which is then reflected back down to earth almost instantly.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most significant thing the wheel has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
As a result, we have the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-size prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niches, special areas or tasks that each predator is responsible for, which prevents competition.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not to other big cats).
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times as hard as a powerful man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar with a mighty voice, but more like a few hoarse shouted words.
Occasionally they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds, but the vast majority of animals that ocelots hunt are significantly smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and search for animals that can be eaten (prey) by scent and by sniffing the places they have been.
They can see very well in the dark using night vision, and they also move very stealthily, and ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then diving in.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as when it moves across mountains or a river, or when it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in an environment that is different from its original one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they become less and less like members of other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
The name for this process is speciation, which simply means the development of a new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes, we use plants to make our clothes, most of what we eat comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and it may have fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't match it.
While many of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a plch.
Another difference is that poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, while rich men preferred communal banquets, where they ate their meals while lounging on their sides.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly could not have contained ingredients that were not introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a major temple, which they viewed as the home of the deity.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and priests attended to the needs of the deities by means of rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes temples included specially built pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
A house was not essential in the hot climate of the Middle East.
For most of their lives, the average Hebrew family lived under the open sky.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops had counters facing the street, and houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found new land and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are "Scandinavian" countries, there are many differences in people, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunt, you might think there was a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, a large parchment document (measuring 30 inches by 25 inches [75 cm by 62 cm]) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the record served only to identify the document.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an invasion codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people who live and work cooperatively as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and this word is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this also defines the size of a society in a way.
City-states are the ancestors of nations.Civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of a cultural footprint and an even spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states first established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress relied on state governments to enforce all of its laws.
It also had no authority to rewrite tax and tariff laws between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the national football team from Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international events and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/grouping of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view Japan is often considered as an 'archipelago'
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins transforming native grain-growing practices, and hires Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three basic structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1975, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common photographic format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensors of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is a surprising 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format, which is divided by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio, is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) equal or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
Very often used, but also ridiculed, is the simple rule of thirds, which creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
He argues that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, Christianity bound European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power has affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for these very purposes.
The church had been present in Rome as a central authority for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its principles were being followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain conditioned international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations.
When the world saw the horrors and atrocities committed during World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter from his former manager, Charles Batchelor, recommending him to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each historical period of China, or each family that was in power, was a dynasty that made its mark on history in a significant way.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which existed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people died fighting for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
Many social and political phenomena are observable, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
It's the same in the army, because instead of rank being based on class, they've gone to caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond earthly life, and he often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, on Mount Noor (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to get into, even if you know where it is, because once you're in a cave, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except a clear, beautiful sky and a number of surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large-scale pyramid structures erected in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, is located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead and contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
An 'up' sign looks like a V and a 'down' sign looks like a pin or a square without a bottom.
Top means that you should start at the tip and press down on the string, while bottom means that you should start at the fret (the place where you hold the string in your hand) and pull the string.
The upper part of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower part is firmer and more durable.
Feel free to write down your own tracks, but remember that printed sheet music is there for musical reasons, so you should usually keep it.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were driven from Versailles back to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris by car, accompanied by an angry mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved to the terrified queen the head of the royal guard that had been beheaded at Versailles.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to pay for most of the expenses and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government was funneled through the banking houses to Wall Street.
Obviously, the enormous profits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The period during which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, an epoch of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally dated around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of concepts from the development of new technologies or the technological imperative to its narrow meaning that human destiny is governed by the logic of scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology "affects" societies in ways that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in medicine to restore injured bodies.
An important element of Romanticism was cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged that were consistent with society and were better than arbitrarily set laws.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began sometime around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely because the returning crusaders brought gifts of silk and spices that were valued more highly than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the greatest inventions of the period, brought about by the Crusades, was the button.
Subsistence farming is farming practised for the purpose of producing the quantity of food necessary exclusively for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses one's own stored seed - sourced from an ecoregion - combined with seeding or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterised by the age, ethnicity, social class, geographic location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a distinct subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization draws on several unfortunate cases of children who were neglected, unhappy, or deliberately abused and did not socialize with adults as adolescents.
Some unruly children have been restrained by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents have abandoned the child because they could not cope with a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is raised only by animals other than human beings, its behaviour (within physical limits) is almost the same as that of a particular animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, a strategy called 'scaffolding' goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool to help people who encounter new learning experiences, such as using a new computer programme or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher is also a form of scaffolding, but so is a small paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised in the software and is primarily intended to challenge and explain procedures that are too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it is.
Our perception is that the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is designed to provide children with everything they need that was lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of use and satisfaction theory.
For example, there is a suggestion that 'learning' and 'socialising' are important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In researching audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified 'personal engagement' and 'lasting relationships' as motivating aspects.
The use of video has led to major breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that correct interpretation of microexpressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work The President's Speech, showed that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge the sincerity of speech.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection in turn removes them from the pool of manifest variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Failure to do so will result in serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
Probably the most readily available plant sources were the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
You can do this simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
However, if you put off ringing the alarm while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness that a person has is indirectly related to the tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force, every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only obstacle is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expanded on the Mahayana way of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple and involves kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yogic postures, aerobic exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and indeed it was fought through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive wall had been breached, and the only hope for it was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Almost overnight, however, those plans were shattered when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops, in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral, marched into the eastern regions of Poland, forming the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure that your country maintained its ability to move people and goods, but at the same time to prevent your enemy from moving people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
And at the same time, the German navy was trying to stop these movements, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies failed, Germany could probably conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often tended by goat herders, who were often children or adolescents, much like the common goat herder.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the chariots consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the draft horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Railroad ties were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place; however, it was later discovered that rails would be more effective if they were topped with an iron band.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transportation is walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago when Homo erectus evolved.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
As in many cases, this is a kind of symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should go to the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant life-styles have only exacerbated the problems.
After passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten proposal signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Over the course of one night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap's Side Pages.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap side pages still exist and are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1. In computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, since symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The most immediate sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household cleaners.
Refer to the first aid instructions provided on the label for this particular poisoning.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The name comes from the ancient knowledge of the bed bug, an insect highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both earwigs and bed bugs are non-native, adapted to live in a nest or on their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it one of the leading neurological diseases in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a child.
These couples may decide to make what is called an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods, and these methods actually drive most scientific research.
But it's not just about experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific findings, including those in the field of psychology, were accepted.
The West gradually found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots as knowledge of Greek declined.
Many observed physiological and behavioural rhythms are often critically dependent on the presence of internal cycles and their generation by the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been documented as having regular rhythms that are not simply responses to repetitive external signals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue to cycle at rest in the absence of stimuli from the external environment.
The experiment performed by Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on their type, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells are affected by germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
Tours, photographs, and encounters with orangutans in Borneo are examples.
People leave small rural towns every morning for work and are passed by others who work where the first ones have just left.
In this shuttle, everyone is in some way tied to and supportive of the car-based transport system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy displaced the stable state of the biosphere that had supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the result of observing the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is challenging because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, and therefore traffic flows that can be approximated mathematically often behave consistently.
For a better representation of the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This offers them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or technical perfection.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the least densely populated.
In Vatican City, Italian is used for official communications and legislation.
Italian is also used on a daily basis by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they all occur naturally and can be mined relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, yet he thought they changed into new substances in order to create what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
They are alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
When the pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many people.
However, as newer methods of writing appeared, the pencil was pushed aside and used less and less.
People now leave messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a grater.
Maybe just think about what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb uses the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, and then some of that energy is released when the core splits again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they're prone to breaking apart with little or no pushing.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner below the maria and thicker below the summit.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what leads people to behave the way they do or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become their own in adulthood.
These theories focus on what motivates people to want to do certain things and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning accountability, and being accountable to people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and do it his way.
The manager is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the entire team.
This behaviour often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual and traditional teams are governed by the same quality standards, but with small differences.
Virtual team members mostly serve as a contact point for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can meet according to changing time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique feature of the virtual team is also the presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the executive departments of an organization, it opens the door to creativity and ingenuity.
The process of collaboration within an organisation to overcome a barrier can then lead to a new innovative process that helps meet customer needs.
An organisation can be innovative, but first management needs to create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
The film Anjel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations aim to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, narrowing the field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior encourages scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes as never before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
AI has a strong science fiction connotation and forms a major branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of robots.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Cases include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been embedded in several applications in home computers, or applications in video game software.
Excursions are an important part of every class's life, and the teacher would often like to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom with their classmates.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with other classes.
Every year, for example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol.
While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience tends to change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In blogging, "students are forced to be more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience's interest thus inspires students to become more skilled and pursue their interests (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend education far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "will allow students to deepen their analytical and critical thinking; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their attitudes in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's charming "bilingual" capital, offers visitors a wealth of art galleries and museums that represent its past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas higher up in the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and Comoros and Mayotte embraced it in a big way.
A period of European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female passengers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but only one that does not look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would normally consider harassment.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. Under the name Anfa, it served as a strategic port for the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and renamed it Dar al-Bayda, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of geegaws can easily be found around the old medina, but these are all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, you should do your research before traveling outside Goma to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
It is also the starting point for treks to Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
To travel around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for relatively inaccessible, exotic, and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction.
In 1990 the city was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stops during his PBS special The Strange Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country because its appearance is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP), in northeastern South Africa, stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily park maintenance fees and entrance fees.
It may be most beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a select number of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Named after Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong is a place of great interest to many tourists.
The cluster of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline might be compared to the glowing bar graph seen from Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the best view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonialists appropriated, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarban is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests include not only mangrove swamps but also some of the last remnants of the massive jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is water/wetland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a kingdom of wilderness, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Indian tigers and some 30,000 white-tailed deer in the region.
Buses depart from the inter-city bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance, since intercity buses are often full.
Most prefectures are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby towns such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the entire Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 272 feet [83 m], are 1,200 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was put into operation only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs inspection posts should be completed.
The Guarani were a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer people who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was born as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in the Las Cañitas section.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
Information on tournaments and the possibility of purchasing tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check beforehand with the owners to see what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures of over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' periods: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful they may seem, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods, and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous maritime dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering of people in the town led to the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The proximity of Auckland's two harbors allows for many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with many shops lining the shoreline.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines are available, while New Zealand and Australian wines may be more readily available.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are concerned, bottled water is not a problem.
The concept of a flat white is foreign to Australians - a small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with a heavy layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the competent authorities, pay attention to signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean, their usual habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead of time gives the traveler confidence that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies usually have an agreement with specific hotels, but they also offer the possibility of booking other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any suggestions for changes or requests should be addressed in the first instance to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site and most participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the musical performances on the main stages have ended, in some parts of the festival, the music may continue late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the hut, as walking on ice causes quite a lot of noise for those most affected.
Cruises in St Petersburg include a stay in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (but check the conditions).
Casinos usually try hard to maximize the time and expense of their patrons, and most lack windows or clocks and are difficult to navigate.
They usually have unique offerings of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and staying as long as possible.
Since drunkenness impairs judgment, all good players recognize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you could become trapped.
Reduced visibility can be caused by falling or blowing snow, condensation on windows, or ice forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a great experience for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a journey overland to explore the spectacular African wilderness, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen from a distance with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking or bush tourism safari or just walking) is a tourist excursion of several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, doing so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have found yourself in an uncomfortable situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-related cancellations do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It can be expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a regular ticket costing about 7,000 yen.
Even if the clothes are not in the room, many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for rent.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to make the substance too hot (this may cause shrinkage and, in extreme cases, burns).
There are different ways of treating water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it takes only a minute to boil water; in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not present in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans violently do not usually qualify as pests.
Shopping in so-called duty-free zones allows you to obtain goods exempt from ordinary and excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often traverses isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: They are full of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections - normally 56-64 km/h - and their strict observance is more important than ever.
Surprisingly, cell phone service here is much stronger than many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria it is quite colorful and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common; apples are baked year-round, while cherries and plums are baked during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts, often combined with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but hearty pastry, try the stuffed doughnut, called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid used, curry can be described as "dry" or "wet".
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
When used without further qualification, the term tends to mean a food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The predominant seasonings favored by Javanese include peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can also present a safety hazard as they can potentially trap the rider's feet.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but has his leg caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse escapes.
Most riders wear riding boots with a high heel and a fairly narrow smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, are equipped with safety bars that allow the stirrup to fall out of the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley is a popular mountaineering destination in Chile and has been called the Yosemite of South America because of its variety of huge granite walls and rock outcrops.
The views from the peaks are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through the walls' infinite potential.
Popular downhill winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski fanatics", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a given location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, ski mountaineering, or ski touring.
Related (but usually not included) to alpine ski touring and mountaineering, which is practiced on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and footwear.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you were walking - but you will rarely reach the speed of bareback running on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent states.Normally, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through repeated visa applications and passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Also, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
Determination conditions vary around the world and this age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be classified as antiques even though they are younger than a similar mass-produced product.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and a culture of commerce is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, reindeer husbandry was not practiced extensively by all Sami, who subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sami are involved in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are about to visit is the subject of travel advice, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
In addition to your own government, you may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Information reporting provides only a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified when compared with more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon which has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Adverse weather and its various types, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions, can occur anywhere in the world.
Strong wind, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of adverse weather such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.

Travellers are strongly advised to consider any risks that may arise from adverse weather in their area which may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered to be a war zone should participate in professional training.
Do an Internet search for "hostile environment training", and you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course deals in much greater detail with all the issues discussed here, together with practical experience.
The length of the course is usually 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid instruction, and sometimes perhaps weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documentation for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired currency and gender varies.
Similarly, the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies.
In the post-9/11 period, security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through the scans without invasion of privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning fallout from waves breaking on a beach, often a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, where a deep water fast current can form.
Most deaths can be attributed to exhaustion while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head someplace where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether or not you've been registered, you can try to wait for rescue.
Rebound shock occurs more quickly than culture shock (the initial idyll phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
For travelers who have been able to adjust easily to a new culture, readjusting to their own culture can be especially challenging.
Returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your home-grown habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not anticipate that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the area's main attractions for children.
You can visit the pyramids in darkness and silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear a lot of tourists and vendors, and the sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is on display as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The pyramids depict different scenes and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen still active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area in the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains converge here to form a plateau and then rise again to form the 225-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Mountains are Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak, Mount Vinson, reaching 16,028 feet [4,892 m].
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone. To make a call, you must be outdoors in a location with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is frequently used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as on journeys requiring long-distance data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, travelling and learning is still the preferred option.
It is particularly popular among recent graduates, as it offers them the opportunity to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a bridging course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Usually, tuition fees are required to enrol in these programmes.
Finland is a great place for boating. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on an archipelago or a lake.
While the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the figure is 1 in 40).
Most Baltic Sea cruises also offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have a couple of full days to visit the historic city before returning to the ship for the night.
If you go ashore only for a cruise excursion, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for passengers of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that so many people have.
For some people, understanding how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that's based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for speedy delivery, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller companies there was a problem.
When goods were shipped by air freight, some routes could take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a large amount of money for the privilege (or ideally get your airline to do it for you).
But it won't be cheap: you can expect to pay an estimated four times the normal fare for business class and up to 11 times for first class!
In general, it is also not worth seeking discounts on business tickets or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, although Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

Regular metro announcements are only made in Catalan, but unplanned stops are announced by an automated system in different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.

The austere exterior of the Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little common courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely covered with forests, mainly beech, spruce and fir, with a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animals and birds.
It is home to rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and tetra, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun may smile at you as you enter.
The same regulations require men to wear trousers that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this outfit from the storeroom at the entrance, but it is important to note that the garment is not washed after each wearer, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and includes olive oil.
A simple favourite dinner, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes or another accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns and the personal pronoun Sie (You) always start with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and objects.
It's also proven to help simplify reading, but writing is a little more complicated because of the need to distinguish whether a verb or an adjective is being used in the noun form.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple because most words are pronounced the same way they are written
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation differs according to the following vowel.

Therefore, reading this grammar primer could help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
True, if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to teach Portuguese.
People with some knowledge of Spanish, however, may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to require special study.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and remain in use as museums or places for education.
They're usually located in cities or on campuses, because they were built in their heyday, before the light pollution problem existed, and they're easier to get to than the ones built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held only for the emperor and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many Christmas traditions in Christendom have been adopted by unbelievers and non-Christians around the world.
According to tradition, you will spend Easter in the open air to watch the sun rise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with gatherings often held at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either swam, flew or swam.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from making the journey, transforming the giant tortoise into the Galapagos' primary grazer.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you can experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It will be a good opportunity to observe the northern lights, since the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
And you'll be able to enjoy the stars, too, because light pollution is not a problem in sparsely populated areas.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are used to.
Suits are common work attire, and coworkers address one another by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, emphasizing group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors before any decision is made, and they are expected to follow their instructions implicitly.
