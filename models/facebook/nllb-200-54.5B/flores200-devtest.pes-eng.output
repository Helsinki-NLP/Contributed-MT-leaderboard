This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already been popular in scientific circles, but it also provides information that fossils in general can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's decorative feathers were oak-brown on top and carotenoid on the bottom.
This finding also adds to our understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because this dinosaur's feathers don't have a well-developed bar, called a stalk, but have other features of feathers -- beards and fine hairs -- the researchers argue that the evolutionary development of the stalk was probably later than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but were used for temperature regulation or display.
The researchers noted that even if this tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, it still represents the feathers of an adult animal and not the crest of a chicken.

Radiance and rotation are used to determine the star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversal.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by wave forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy's arc.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in the form of a halo around a galaxy and is made up of lots of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been done with primitive technology: voters stood in individual booths and placed a pre-printed sheet of paper representing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the authorities have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the ballot paper into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets relatively strict rules for these procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe any part of the process. At night, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness could be affected because his image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts take a different approach and have ruled that the publication of the photos is potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says: "Journalists seem to be walking a fine line when it comes to publishing photos etc. of suspects".
The Scottish Court of Session, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution of the case, has told journalists that no further explanation will be given, at least until a conviction is announced.
The document is based on this information leak and concerns a border dispute, in which Palestine demands borders according to the conditions before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other reported discussions include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, as well as the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the parliament agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters participating in the supplementary pest control trial had to be carefully monitored by foresters, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director of Park and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in the last four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests were sparked by the cancellation of elections scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 overheating events, which the company called "non-serious".
In a reaction, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers, were initially released.
The photographers then posed as an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a gynaecologist and started work at Auckland National Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
Her research showed that if the hormone is administered, it accelerates fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight reports from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna Aday.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated, "Luna was as temperamental as I was...maybe more so...I loved her but I left her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic were up 8% from 2008.
Julia Gillard, the interim Prime Minister, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed Australia should never become a republic.
She won Olympic gold medals in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaint, there have been doubts about her fitness for the Games.
She hasn't been able to get the medication she needs to manage her pain because it's banned.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely to be the source of Earth's supply of water and organic materials that could be the building blocks of proteins and life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed after comets collided in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and later this month passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense".
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) claims that the NextGen system will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology versus ground-based radar technology that allows air traffic controllers to track aircraft more accurately and gives pilots more accurate information.
No additional vehicles will be allowed to enter and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and no park and ride facilities will be provided for the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they might have to play behind closed doors and without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the evolution of new species in just two generations, although it was believed to have taken much longer due to inbreeding between a native Darwin's squirrel, a medium-sized ground squirrel, and a migrating cactus squirrel, the greater cactus squirrel.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be made into very thin rings.
It can be drawn on thin wire that can be twisted and woven together; it can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
It can be made very thin and embedded in other metals. It can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called gilding.
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage water.
Cauliflower juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is represented by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which an electron has been stripped (as hydrogen atoms consist of only one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, dry hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which have an interesting feel and form a kind of shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has a flush tank toilet connected to a state-of-the-art sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan and Santorini houses in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Iran and China there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in groups.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and reflects it down almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
To put a satellite or telescope in space requires a large rocket more than 100 feet high.
The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation easier and faster.
The wheel has given us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below this group are more medium-sized female cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to mountain goats and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic sloths) that eat a large number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of kenam, the special thing that every San cat does to keep it out of competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related adult males along with thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Grouper lions act much like wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are very deadly to their prey.
Like a six-legged athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is also placed in the same group (Genus Panthera) with the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four species are the only female cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion, but more like a series of growling words.
Leopards like to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the leopard preys on are much smaller than its body.
Scientists hypothesize that the jaguar tracks animals using its sense of smell to find food (prey), and sniffs out their footprints on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they can see well in the dark, and move very quietly. To hunt prey, the ocelot first camouflages itself in the surrounding environment and then suddenly dives on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a microbial community) becomes separated from the original community to which it belongs (such as when it moves across a mountain range or river, or when it moves to a new island to which it cannot easily return), it often finds that it is in an environment different from its previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different capabilities or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need previous adaptations to the environment.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new environment, they become less and less like other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants photosynthesize their food from the sun. They also provide shade
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs were the top predators of their time, so they weren't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and may even have been homosexual.
It also attacks anything that gets into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Terex would be no different.
While much of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange and unusual items including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called the hibernator.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the women sat on their chairs and ate their meals, the rich men liked to have banquets together and enjoy their meals together.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods brought from the Americas and Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a basic temple for each of their deities, which served as the god's house.
People were expected to offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests were expected to attend to the needs of the gods during rituals and celebrations.
Each temple had an open courtyard followed by an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
At the top of the tower was God's special sanctuary.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter much.
This Jewish family had lived outdoors most of their lives.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops had play counters overlooking the street; stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce, and wood was expensive.
Greenland was gradually settled. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimos were living there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one yet knows who wrote it, it is known that the large calligraphic document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was hung for safekeeping early in its life.
So, it's possible that the note was simply attached as a label.
The opening day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them rather than fight the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and changed course towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture practiced by a very large group of people, a society, who live and work together.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning townsman, and civitas, meaning city, and to some extent defines the size of a society.
A civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a long cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Microcultures often die out without leaving relevant historical evidence and cannot be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government under the principles of the Confederacy - of which Congress was the sole constituent.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judiciary, and relied on often uncooperative government officials to carry out all its actions.
It also had no reference to the abolition of tax laws and tariffs between countries.
Amendments to these clauses require the unanimous consent of all countries, and countries must also obtain the favourable opinion of their central government even in the absence of a representative.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are highest in popularity in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to its geographical location.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa", or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a revolution in native grain production operations and employing Chinese laborers to work on its sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the western and northern regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the outlying buildings have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still-image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly it borrows its aspect ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
In fact, the 35mm format is a bit confusing, and 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (which we divide by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The very annoying and ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three vertical and horizontal images (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had bound European countries together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church coffers were created for exactly that reason.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the principle has served its purpose.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade generally violated international law adopted by several international agreements over the past two centuries, cutting off vital military and civilian resources proved to be an effective strategy.
Britain has mined entire sections of the ocean to prevent any ships from entering international waters, even threatening neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to unconditional submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude in most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, nations resolved to prevent such atrocities from ever happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to New York City in the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in America with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former boss, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each time period of China or each family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability when the provinces were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, there were fierce battles between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying for the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, including the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, making it possible for more ambitious and successful people to succeed.
The same was true for the military, because instead of the military ranking being based on rank, it was now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this earthly life. He used to go to meditate in a cave called Hira on Mount Noor.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very clear idea of the spiritual leanings of Muhammad.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows it's there, it's not easy to find.
There's nothing but a beautiful, clear sky above and mountains all around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the original Seven Wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Pyramid Complex of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest) and several small tombs, several temples and a large statue of Abol-Hol.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down arrow" symbol looks like a bracelet or a square with no end.
Up means you start at the tip and pull the bow, and down means you start at the heel and pull the bow forward.
Usually pulling the bow toward the neck produces a softer sound, while the opposite movement is stronger and firmer.
Draw your markings freely with a pencil, but remember that Arche's printed markings have a musical aspect to them, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified Queen Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to leave their carriage windows wide open.
One member of the crowd reportedly waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The cost of US imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay their taxes to the American colonial regime to settle the bulk of the costs and profits of floating bonds in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly called the Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Medieval Period and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological algebra is a term that actually encompasses a range of ideas, from the technological imperative or technological necessity to the strict meaning of the word that fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their emergence in technology governs human destiny.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has more "effects" on inherent societies than on conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
But a highway network for a small number of cars was not economically viable, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Universal car ownership also leads to high rates of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to new approaches in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a huge element of cultural determinism that came from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Eschwege.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture associated with that geography evolved, and these were in harmony with the position of the society, which was better than the laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of aristocracy began about 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its position was weakened as the Crusaders returned gifts of silks and spices worth more than the Eastern Roman market could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was mainly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop fashion. One of the biggest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades and people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done in order to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to ecological regions along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers made their living through agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Microcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Microcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, ambience, and deliberate dialect.
One of the most common ways used to explain the importance of socialization is to enlist the help of unfortunate cases of children who did not learn socialization as they grew up due to neglect, abuse, or deliberate exposure to adults.
Some of these feral children are imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this release is due to the parents' denial of the child's severe mental and physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or emotional trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (in the physical realm) that are almost animal-like, such as fear and indifference toward humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but an aid that supports people who are receiving a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding may be virtual or real, in other words a teacher is a kind of scaffolding but a small paperclip in Microsoft Office is also a scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and aims to question, provoke and explain in ways that may be challenging for students to do alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that lacks nutrition, care and discipline, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe space for these kids.
Our foster care system strives to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
In order to adopt a child, it is necessary to provide for the needs of the adopted child that were lacking in the previous home.
The Internet combines elements of collective and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usability and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "sociability" are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting small phrases one can tell if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be shared in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two sources of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
The mutation adds new genetic diversity and selectively removes it from the pool of expressed diversity.
Separation and recombination pushes the difference between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Outside the savannah, meeting the amino acid-based needs of a primate with a human-like digestive system from available plant sources would have been difficult.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant sources are the proteins in leaves and beans, but they're hard for mammals like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
A sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and going back to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn your alarm clock off in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a specific diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner calmness is inversely related to the level of stress in the body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the gift of life force.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantra and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Through the visualization of various gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to an alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States. By the end of the war, differences in system, process, and culture led to the separation of these countries.
Given the last two years of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This was to last for the next 40 years, fighting with proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places in real time.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Spirale.
But those plans fell apart almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to make sure that your country has the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One example worth mentioning was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy tried to stop the passage, mainly by using U-boats.
If Germany had defeated the Allies, it might have won over Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats as a whole were kept in herds on hills or other grassy areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children and adolescents similar to typical shepherds. These methods of herding are still practiced today.
The railway was built in the 16th century in England.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Railing was introduced almost from the beginning to hold the rails in place. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if there was an iron brace on the railing.
Although this became common, iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Eventually wooden wheels replaced iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest form of transport was walking; humans started walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors were Southern Cape people who didn't walk normally by habit.
Bipolar peculiarity has been found in Southern Cape fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the coastal Chadians may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become environmental activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
This is exactly like many supportive care cases, however, if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problems and we need to deactivate them.
It's clear that the world has changed because of human scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by human overpopulation and bizarre lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by John Hancock, president of Congress, and Charles Thomson, secretary, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were created, now known as the "Dunlap Manifesto".
It was John Nixon who first read the document in public on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, a transcript was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, a transcript arrived in London.
Dunlap 25 still exists and is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original manuscript version has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't recognize them as dinosaurs.
But there's a lot about birds that still resembles dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits.
Internal poisoning is not immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be immediately recognized.
The best cause of internal poisoning may be an empty medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bed bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are highly adaptable parasitic insects in humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-dwelling, meaning they adapt to living in a nest or living in a host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a major neurological disease in younger and older adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a baby.
These couples can arrange an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, parents give up their parental rights to another couple to take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the case in isolation, it is an experiment and an experiment that is necessary to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, and also conduct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West lost touch with its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
Many believe that physiological and behavioral rhythms are often strongly linked to the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a freewheeling cycle in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the earliest indications of the genetic nature of DNA.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with pertussis phosphorus or the phage protein with pertussis sulfur.
Mutations can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether or not the cells involved are germline cells.
Only mutations in the same microbial cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes such as plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside by car to go to work and are picked up by others who are going to work where they came from.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supported by a transportation system based on personal cars.
Science now shows that this macro-carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, a state that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do we see them fail every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of autonomous drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable constants, and this can be roughly mathematically determined.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three characteristics are determined: 1) flow, 2) density, and 3) acceleration.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade predators and find food and mates more easily.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them the ability to hide from predators in a wider range of small spaces.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and day-old mosquitoes.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars) revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because you don't feel like you're moving on the ground, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the world's second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the Earth's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, there was never a pyramid that surpassed the Triple Pyramid in terms of size and technical superiority in construction.
The New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, monuments that were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and also has the smallest population among countries.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and administrative communication.
Italian is also an everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these elements can be found in pure form in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle hypothesized that everything was made from a combination of one or more of four elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances and form what we observe.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals.
There are also alloys that contain trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when the pencil came out, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer ways of writing, the pencil is used less and less.
Today, people write their messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the row will be like when nothing ever works out.
A fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the nucleus of an atom and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to collapse with little or no warning.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and soil. The outer layer is called the lunar crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the marshes and thicker under the uplands.
As the crust becomes thinner, there may be more openings on the near side, making it easier for magma to rise to the surface.
Content theories are based on what it is that people repeat or like.
These theories propose that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during development and adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do what they do and what are the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors emerge.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable person who feels they have to change whatever the team is doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates rifts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their adjacent physical group.
They often have more autonomy than contract team members because their teams can organize meetings based on different time zones, but their local management may not be aware of these time zones.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which each member reports. This invisible team sets specific standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across organizational functional units, creativity and ingenuity can happen.
As a result, the process of organizational collaboration to overcome barriers can lead to a new creative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more rigorous.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is backed up by research scientists.
It's long been known that various types of brain injury, emotional trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how our minds work.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
Research in the AI industry involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer problems and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such cases have become discrete disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as embedded in numerous home computers and video game software programs.
Excursions are a major part of every classroom. Teachers often like to take their students to places that do not have the option of traveling by bus.
Technology offers a solution by enabling virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting alongside their classmates in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol. The website is revised every year, but older versions are kept online for use as notebooks.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging with a jumble of grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to avoid criticism in order to improve the writing.
Although blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them", the need to satisfy the interest of the student audience encourages alertness and curiosity (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school schedules.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical individuals; and through actively responding to Internet content, students can define their own positions within the context of others' writings as well as express their own views on particular topics" (O'Rourke, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive, bilingual capital of Canada and has a collection of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario stand out to outsiders as something that is quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas in the more northerly regions are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a demographic comparison that will surprise many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands as well, and it took shape on a large scale in the islands of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, it is bordered by the Sahara coast and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also beneficial to get a ring (not necessarily one that looks expensive).
Women need to recognize that cultural differences may lead to events that are uncomfortable for them, and they're less likely to be followed and held and so on.
Be firm in discouraging men and resist fearlessly (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it better!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port and called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and then rebuilt it as Casablanca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Dar es Salaam, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities in Morocco for shopping.
Around the old city, you can find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, tiles and a full range of prints, but all this is only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city streets, especially the city centre.
Although security in Goma has been responsibly maintained, any visit outside Goma must be measured to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along which are the cheapest trails found for mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use motor taxis to get around the city of Goma. The typical (local) price is about 500 CFA for a short ride.
The almost inaccessibility of Timbuktu has led to its name being used as a metaphor for a strange and inaccessible land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it is a tourist attraction because of its antiquity and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
That stop was one of the main stops during Louis Gates' PBS special called "The Wonders of Africa".
It stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches from the east along the border with Mozambique and from the north along the border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different biogeographic realms, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a fee for daily protection and entrance.
It can be useful to buy a game card that gives access to a selection of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island has given its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider as their main tourist focus.
The buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline look like a glowing bar graph, revealed by their presence along the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite end of Kowloon Beach.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development along the northern coastline is densely settled on reclaimed land.
This is where the English colonists claimed it for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest integrated mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and India inland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest section located in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans Forest Park.
These forests are not just Karna marshes - they contain some of the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Indus and Ganges basins.
The Sundarbans area is about 3,850 square kilometres and about one-third of it is water.
The Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 antelopes have now been seen in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them run between 06:30 and 07:30, especially to the east and Jakarta.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most areas are covered by small Japanese sea buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the tower is 15 meters. Its construction was completed in August 2011 and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The completion date of the bridge is September 2017, which is when the customs stations are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Province of the Indian Giant", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción's founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many of its indigenous characteristics.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best football teams and the best players in the world.
The biggest race of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas clay courts.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for tournament news and where to buy tickets.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
It is possible to change money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley and along the FIC West shopping mall.
British pounds are usually accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency is accepted; coordinate the accepted payment method with the owners beforehand.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures commonly reach over 30 degrees Celsius.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "dry" and "rainy" season: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, wildlife is still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wildlife!
Buffalo, deer, elk, bear and almost any large animal, no matter how tame, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance.
Additionally, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour is famous for stopping a fleet attack in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain did not leave the harbour.
All but one British warship were sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's location between two harbours, there are many beaches.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour area) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Dunport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where swimming is safe and most of them have the shade of Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the popular towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded and have good shops along the beach.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not sophisticated, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to consume, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
It's perfectly safe to drink local tap water, but you can easily find bottled water if you're scared.
For Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign idea. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is served with plenty of cream (and not just froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to coral reefs throughout the year and injuries from these factors are rare on coral reefs.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow the signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near the coasts and near the mouths of the 1770 northern rivers from October to April. Occasionally they can be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance reminds the traveler of the convenience of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with certain hotels, although you can probably also find out about other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, coordination of transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also make an appointment for you if you need time to think about the offer or prepare other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Therefore, any amendments or requests must be made through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, a large portion of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this an essential part of the program.
If you want to be close to the stage, you should arrive early to get a campsite close to the stage.
Keep in mind that although the music on the main stages may have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin as some fairly frightening sounds can be heard when crossing the ice for those most affected.
Residency in St. Petersburg involves spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check regulations).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests entertained and in place.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over high mountain passes needs to consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
There's less friction on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive as naked as you can on asphalt.
During a blizzard, the snow can fall so hard in an instant that it traps you.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the windshield.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, attracting many visitors.
The term "safari" generally refers to an overland journey to view the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars from a distance, and standard equipment makes it possible to visit them conveniently.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a hunting camera.
A safari is a hike (also called a "leaf walk", "safari hike", or "walk") that involves walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in for a disaster.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and an ironing board, even if it is not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to melt or, worse, burn).
There are a variety of methods for water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, and in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your bottled drinking water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter species of pests that are unfamiliar in their native areas.
Pests spoil food, cause distress or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread their venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with their power are not usually described as disasters.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes and duties in some places.
Restricting travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes result in significant savings, especially in the case of products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between the Point Marion and Fairmont areas has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo Freeway, as it repeatedly traverses through isolated scattered woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are steeper gradients, narrower lanes and more sharp turns.
Installed speed limits are significantly less than previous and subsequent sections - typically 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h) - and their strict observance is even more important than other sections.
Surprisingly, cell service is much stronger here than other parts of the trail, for example, the Pennsylvania Wild.
German pastries are very good and in Bavaria they are varied and rich, and more similar to what is cooked in our southern neighbor in Austria.
Fruit desserts are common. Apple desserts are baked throughout the year, and cherries and plums are used for decoration in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often served with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but compact dessert, just try something called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on where you are.
Curry is a food prepared with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of fluid present, a job can be "dry" or "wet".
In the central regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines across the nation, as there are 17,000 islands to choose from in Indonesia.
However, in the absence of further qualification, the term originally meant food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese food, which is widely available throughout the archipelago today, contains a range of simple spicy dishes, predominant Javanese seasonings are peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
A footrest is sometimes a support for the rider's foot that hangs on either side of the saddle.
Although they provide more stability for the rider, they can pose safety concerns as the rider's feet are likely to get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse will be dragged along the ground if he escapes. To minimize this risk, many precautions can be taken.
The first is that most riders wear riding boots that have a heel and the toe is flat and quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's leather to separate from the saddle in the event of a fall.
In Cochamó - the top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America and has a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
At the highest point there are breathtaking views of the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes through the many potential walls.
Winter hill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you ski down snow-covered slopes using a ski pole or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity that has many enthusiasts and is sometimes known as "ski touring", which is the planning of an entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 BC.
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not include ski touring or alpine style mountaineering, the latter being done on sloped terrain and requiring sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail the same way you think of a hiking trail.
In good weather you can cover much more distance than on foot - but it is very rare to be able to ski cross-country quickly without carrying a heavy backpack on smooth trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between multiple countries requires going through multiple visa application and passport control processes.
However, the Schengen Area acts like a country in this respect.
As long as you are in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities consider items older than 100 years to be antiques.
This definition varies geographically, especially in regions such as North America where the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the cultural exchange that exists around its trade is also important for many other professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sami were involved in raising large reindeer, they lived through fishing, hunting and the like, and used reindeer mostly as service animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism is one of the most important sources of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage and disruption to community life or loss of life.
Dry weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterfalls and monsoon storms are all forms and effects of extreme weather.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather events include hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any possibility of severe weather affecting their area as this could affect travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that is considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An Internet search for the phrase 'hostile environment cycle' is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
A training course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail and usually includes practical experience.
A training course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing and a high volume of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are plentiful, but publications on war zones are few.
Travellers who intend to undergo gender reassignment abroad must have valid documentation for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or to update documents to match individuals' desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to certify these documents varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intense in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender people should not expect to go through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact before the procedure.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves moving from the shore towards the sea, often occurring in a rock or similar location.
Backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections due to the underwater topology, and rapid flow to deeper water may occur there.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the tide, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than usual.
Try to target a place where you won't get trapped again or, depending on your skills, and whether or not you've been spotted, you can wait for rescue.
Homecoming shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it is shorter than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it very difficult to return to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have lost some of your habits from your home culture.
At the beginning of their trip abroad, people were probably patient and understanding and knew that travelers who came to a new country needed to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound of the pyramid and the light show is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you can always hear the voices of tourists and vendors.
The Sphinx stands as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
These scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and have the most bases with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. Its largest island is King George, and its residential area is called Villa Las Estrellas (Village of the Stars).
Other islands include Livingstone and Deception, whose volcanic lake atop an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Thorthland is a region in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Billingshausen Sea.
The Peninsular Mountains merge with the plateau here, then rise again to form a 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which the Minnesota Glacier has cut in half.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which has an elevation of 4,892 metres (16,035 ft) on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a phone call you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite.
These services are increasingly used by ships, including pleasure and tourist boats with remote voice and data requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect.
An increasingly popular option is for people to plan a gap year and dedicate it to travel and learning.
It is particularly popular with those who have just left school and allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardising their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of receiving higher education when you return to your home country.
There is usually a fee for enrolment in these programmes.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal peninsulas.
You don't necessarily need a pleasure boat in this collection of islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and larger lakes are large enough for sailboats, small boats and even rowboats offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a ratio of one boat for every seven or eight people.
Similar countries are Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but apart from that it's very unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it's one in 40).
A distinctive feature of many Baltic cruises is that they have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can spend several full days exploring this historic city, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa (since 2009) if you only sail on beach cruises.
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. But as you can see from the map of Berlin above, no part of the city is near the sea and visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic accident.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and loathing of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight may help overcome the fear that comes from the unknown and not having control.
Courier companies get good money for fast delivery of products. Usually, time is very important in sending business documents, goods or spare parts for quick repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes, there was a problem for small companies.
If they were sending things by air mail, on some routes it could take days to load from the plane and clear customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage.
The typical way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty amount in points in advance (or better yet, you can ask your airline to arrange this).
However, it doesn't come cheap: a general rule of thumb says you can expect to pay four times the normal fare paid for economy mode for business mode and eleven times that for first class!
In general, searching for discounts for business and first class seats on flights from point A to point B is pointless.
Airlines are well aware that a group of air passengers with emergencies are willing to pay a lot of money for the benefit of fast and comfortable travel, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic and tribal conflict.
In 1994, the dispute led to the creation of the Autonomous Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and common currency but is not recognised by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion of the Moldovan people is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey and the second largest seaport after Istanbul, with a population of about 3.7 million.
The ancient city of Smyrna, now a thriving modern commercial center, was built around a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century bazaar and old mosques and churches stand out, though the atmosphere is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Hadarsvik overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of this church there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some graves.
It's worth a half-hour stroll around this charming village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, made famous to foreigners after Lord Byron captured it in all its splendor.
The Scatterbus 403 has regular service to Sintra and stops at Cabudaroka.
Also in the north, visit the Great Bust of Our Lady of Fatima (Haram), a place known worldwide for the apparition of Mary.
Please keep in mind that you are essentially visiting the site of a mass grave and also a site that has almost incalculable meaning to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived here, and many others who had loved ones who were murdered there or worked so hard they died, Jewish or not.
Please visit this place with all the dignity, honor and respect it deserves, and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't deface this place by painting walls or carving monuments.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the overwhelming majority understands this language and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan as it is recognised by law as the first official language.
Despite this, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other places.
Normal announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but out-of-schedule disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their arrogance, rudeness and arrogance.
Although this is a common misconception, the best way to be friendly in Paris is still to be polite and behave like a "bien élevé".
If you show some basic courtesy, the seemingly unexpected behavior of the Parisians will disappear immediately.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forest cover and is mainly covered with spruce, pine and fir species and has a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable wide diversity of plant community due to the extent of microclimates, different soils and varied altitude levels.
The area is also home to a great diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and wild rooster can be found here along with many other common species.
While visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have appropriate veils for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own veil, especially a brightly colored one, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun upon entering.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This item can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance but the garment is not washed after each use by the wearer, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
Pa amb Oli is a popular simple dinner, especially during the summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, besides the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even if they come in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and nouns.
It also makes it significantly easier to read, although writing is somewhat complex and requires knowing whether a verb or adjective is used correctly.
Italian is relatively easy to pronounce, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation differs according to the vowels that follow them.
Also, be careful to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So, reading this grammar primer will help you to know more about Persian grammar and know the phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know one of the Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so close as to need no separate examination.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually abandoned and are now museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution was not originally considered a problem but is now, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses and are easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing (hanami) has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China where the flower of choice was plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom ceremony is held by the emperor and only for himself and members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when they're in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If the visit to the garden has been officially arranged, the collection of the "sample" will result in your dismissal without any discussion.
Singapore is a very safe place overall and it's very easy to navigate and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But being in the Tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with heat (always) and intense sunlight (when the sky is clear and much less frequent).
A small number of buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the great biblical patriarchs including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're taking goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good choice for holidays.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or travelling to interesting places on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also identify popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in exposed spots to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian religious justifications for this tradition, but it may well have been a pre-Christian celebration of spring and fertility.
Most traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on a Saturday night during the Easter holiday, while congregations often celebrate at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands either swam, flew or floated.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals couldn't travel there, so the giant tortoise is the main grazer in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have entered the islands, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in winter, you'll experience the polar night, when the sun never rises above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky will be more or less dark during the night of the day.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and often not a problem for light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Clothes are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by family names or job titles.
Compromise is crucial in the workplace, and it should emphasize team effort rather than celebrating individual success.
Workers must often obtain the consent of their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
