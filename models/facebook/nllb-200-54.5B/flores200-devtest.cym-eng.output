In addition to confirming that some dinosaurs had at least feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional order.
Scientists describe the animal's plumage as chestnut brown above and tan or chestnut below.
The discovery provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed shafts, called rachis, but have other feather characteristics - arrowhead and fangs - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult feathers and not juvenile blue.
The researchers suggested that, although this was a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen showed adult feathers and not chicken droppings.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two policemen and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said that fourteen of those injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their light, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which pertains to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Archer galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy as some kind of halo, and that it consists of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and place a sheet of pre-printed paper showing their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
French electoral law organises proceedings quite strictly.
Since 1998, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the ballot except for some of the duly counted authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with her son's murder.
She is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be tainted because her image has been published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have looked at publishing photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish photographs of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has advised journalists that no further comment will be made until at least Tuesday.
The document, according to the secret breach, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects dealt with reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem which is holy to the two nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control trial would be closely supervised by guards, as the trial is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership of NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sport Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Park's Interim Director of Conservation and Heritage with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting campaign received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, which had been due since 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPods catching fire have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 24 additional cases of overheating, with the company calling them "not serious".
The administration responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly unfortunate".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has stunned Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several whales have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, along with the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers replaced an elderly woman as she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Hospital for Women in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government researchers discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Co-residents also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Ethiopia. My first ruler. Luna died on the night of two moons. Unique just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is as weird as me...more so maybe...I love her and I'll see her wishes come true...hope she's in a better place".
Out of 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the poll's conclusion, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 230m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to his problems.
He has not been able to take the drugs he needs to overcome his pain as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several individuals using hardware and software by early February and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gibberish and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft in more detail and provide more detailed information to pilots.
No additional transport is being arranged and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and no car parking or parking and travel facilities are available at the stadium.
Fears of a lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's cactus pink, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus pink, Geospiza conirostris.
All manner of work can be made of gold, and all manner of work can be made of hammered gold.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and folded.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "decorated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H is pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (as Hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, compress them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel weird and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected by a complex sewage system.
Traces of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of our light and our view.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.
From below are more moderate-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, reptiles, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the gallows, a special position held by each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Litters consist of one to three related adult male lions, along with up to thirteen females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions' tusks behave very similarly to those of wolves or dogs (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
An all-around good athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as the roar of a lion: he hath uttered his voice, [as] a lion roareth.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles and birds if they can.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sensing where they have been on land.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it came from (as if it moves over a series of mountains or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it is not easy to move back) it will often find itself in a different environment to the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat most of our food from plants, and without plants, no animals could survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long mouth was full of more than 70 very sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the back of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have matched it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boars, peacocks, mallows, and a type of reptile called a pathew.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together by lying on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built huge temples for each of their gods, each of which was considered to be the home of that god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each Gothic temple had an open temple and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops had an open counter overlooking the street. The stones were used to build houses.
For the wood is in the land of Canaan, and the price of wood is high;
In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large femur document (it measured 29 inches and three quarters by 24 inches and a half) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added merely as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
They were ruled by "Vichy" France. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large significant group of people who live together and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civic, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that somehow defines the extent of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. An originating culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a permanent cultural footprint and an equitable dispersal.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax and tariff laws between provinces.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states were so disrespectful of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster, a group of islands owned by Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "island".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controls the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the leading film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
36mm wide and 24mm high is actually the 35mm format, which is a bit confusing.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are equivalent or roughly equivalent to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal planes (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under attack.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and led this accumulation of power and much money to question whether this belief was being answered.
Shortly after the war began, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties of the past two centuries.
Britain dug international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As it was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and separatism.
After seeing the horrors and devastation of war during World War I, nations were eager to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous position) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of China or each dynasty in power was a particular kingdom.
There was also an unstable period of divided states between each dynasty, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period that occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods there was fierce warfare between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are a number of social effects such as the use of the metric system, a move from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Occupations were also open to all male candidates after the Revolution, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of soldiers because instead of army ranks being based on class they were now based on gun quality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to go to a cave which came to bear the name "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
the cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there.
There is nothing to see except the beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" mark looks like a V and the "bow down" mark looks like a staple or square with its bottom missing.
Up means you should start at the front and push the bow, and down means you should start at the loop (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow usually creates a meditative sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more definite.
You are welcome to mark your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be treated with respect.
King Louis XVl, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, a terrified Madame Elizabeth, were on 6 October 1789 forced back to Paris from Versailles by a swarm of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
On one occasion a member of the high guard stabbed a royal guard who was killed in front of the Queen who was terrified for her life.
The war expenditure of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay for the large amount of spending and interest on bonds that were being raised in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the special profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people would be equivalent to the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars you have to understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, traditionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are innate, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily leads to better roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
There was a large element of cultural determinism in romanticism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture pertaining to that geography arose, and these, existing in harmony with the place of society, were preferable to oppressively imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
This is when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, western fashions may be up to 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own aesthetic.
Sustainable farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family only.
Crop rotation is a simple, often organic, system that uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through a unique and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some half-caste children have been enslaved by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the children were abandoned because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Stepparents may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost exactly like those of the particular animal caring for it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond that.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a support that supports individuals who are having a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but so too is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in the software and are intended to question, motivate, and explain procedures that may have been challenging for the students to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even incarceration.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were not provided in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of mass as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighgmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that persist for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that whether a person is lying can be detected by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his paper The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks suggested how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Separation and recombination move back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (shellfish, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide many proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors would have solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be put on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to be diuretic) before bedtime, forcing one to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of warmth in a person's body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present. Each individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that prevents this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and imagery.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Godhead. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are invigorated and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. By the end of the war it caused conflict in terms of system, process and culture for the warring countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to continue for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were replaced almost overnight, when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Anymosod Agreement, and other international agreements, bilateral as well as multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to move men and materials across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, using mainly U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and fur.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders, who were usually children or young people, similar to the better known shepherd.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the period.
Line slippers were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused further wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first full iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first method of travel we know of, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not often walk upright.
Bipedal appendages are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should calm them down.
It is abundantly clear that mankind's scientific and technological advances have changed the world dramatically, and overpopulation and an unrestrained lifestyle have added to mankind's problems.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap leaflets".
The first public reading of this document by John Nixon was in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and was read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap fragments known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today think that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are many characteristics of birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with heads and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
All general-purpose computers in use today are based on handling information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term wasp is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are colorless, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method drives most scientific research.
It is not alone however, experimentation, which is testing used to eliminate one or more of the possible theories, asking questions, and making observations, also informs scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As understanding of Greece declined, the West found itself divorced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of intrinsic cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a freewheeling cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments by either marking the DNA in the spleen with radioactive phosphorus or the spleen protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the country by car to go to their workplaces and are passed by others who are going to their work destination in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, and supports the system.
Now, science suggests that this massive carbon economy knocked the biosphere out of one of its steady states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) intensity, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back across their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect that can't fold its wings back is the snake's servant bee.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought it was correct but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the narrowest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
An absolute 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or technical prowess.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official correspondence.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Baptists.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what you see.
Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
There are atoms so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the full stop at the end of this sentence.
So the compass was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have come to the fore, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without having to get close to a pen.
One can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's rather like rolling a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no pushing.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may have been more moonspots on the near side because the grains were thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what drives people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the hogs".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she has to change everything the team has been doing and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams are held to the same standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their team may meet according to different time zones that their local managers may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for all members.
Why would an organisation want to go through the laborious process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively across an organisation's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the process of an organization working collaboratively to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help an establishment reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating epistemology, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more detailed.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior aids scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors have an impact on behavior and cause changes in certain mental processes.
Advances in new technologies allow us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although there is a science fiction connotation to Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning and modification in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it is built into many home computer apps and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the answer with virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, the website is remodeled every year, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces pupils to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires pupils to be capable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the vibrant, bilingual capital of Canada and contains a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered uniquely Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas farther north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited desert.
For a comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach holiday destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Peninsular Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passengers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they would consider harassment and that it is not uncommon to be followed, to have your arm held, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole spectrum of trinkets, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the streets of the town, especially the town center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as tracking Mountain Gorillas which are among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorer town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab or African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each hosting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the main symbol of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the Park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focal point for many tourists.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glowing bar chart made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon shores.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists took possession and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 kilometres (50 miles) into the peninsula of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sundarbans National Park is the name of the part of the forest that is within Indian territory.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps however - they contain some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which a third is covered by water bodies.
Since 1966 the Sundurbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 antelopes in the area.
Buses leave the inter-area bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between areas are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two waters rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games are also held at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley across the road from the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds will be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outlying islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold; temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/metre from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metre from all other wildlife.
No matter how large they may appear, wild bulls, chamois, elk, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep the right distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that glows and keep campsites clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of an infamous naval dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of Tupua chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland occupies two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches which are sometimes crowded with a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are a number of wines from France available, but perhaps wines from New Zealand and Australia would travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", a cappuccino comes heavily loaded with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of those causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should take advice from authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box sea slate has been found between beaches and river mouths between October and April north of 1770, although some work can be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles are not active in the sea, their main habitat being in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, enquiries about any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those attending music festivals camp on site, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you'll have to get in early to get a campsite close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages has ended, you may remember that there are parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some holidays have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as going through a grate causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or locks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep guests in good spirits, and to keep them in the building.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high speeds or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy, snow-covered roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to trap you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic remains uninterrupted for most of the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in general usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially on a savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with a spyglass.
The walking safari (also called "wild safari", "hiking safari", or even "hiking") involves hiking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a precarious situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to dry them. Many have iron stoves and an ironing board available to borrow, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to allow fabric to become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in other areas several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a concern, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause painful bites, or in extreme cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in some locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing through isolated rural landscape.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep inclines, narrow alleys, and sharp turns are common.
Speed limits posted are strikingly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) is common - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, though, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other sections of the road, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German crust cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are fatty and varied, similar to those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit crust cakes are common, with apples baked into a crust throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you are in the mood for small but rich crusty cakes, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Knapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In central regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a huge variety of regional foods found throughout the nation.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to mean the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the island, Javanese cuisine consists of a collection of simply flavoured dishes, and the main flavours preferred by Javanese people are groundnuts, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Spurs are supporters for the rider's legs that hang down at each end of the chain.
They offer more stability to the rider but can have safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a rather narrow saddle and toe box.
Next, some chains, especially those from England, have safety bars that allow a leather strap to fall off the chain if it is retracted by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
Its summits contain spectacular views of mountain peaks. Climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes among its endless potential of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski headliners", who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, touring skiing or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not include skiing or alpine mountaineering, the latter on steep terrain and requiring much stronger skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as similar to a walking trail.
In good conditions you can travel considerably longer distances than walking - but you will rarely have cross-country skiing speed without heavy braking on gravel routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what items are manufactured as antiques. Some tax agencies define goods that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be less in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as old things, although they are younger than similar manufactured goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture associated with the craft is also important to many who have other professions.
Nevertheless, even traditionally, not all Sámi have engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived from fishing, similar hunting, and keeping reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani, the word "Gypsy" is considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultation documents are brief summaries of the political situation in just one country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious disruption to society, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of severe weather, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water columns, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of inclement weather affecting their area as it may affect any plans to travel.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile environment course" is likely to yield the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually run from 2-5 days and will include role play, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the journey home.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
A tidal surge is the return flow from waves breaking off a beach, often in a reef or similar.
Because of the subducting polarity the returning flow is concentrated in a few deeper places, and fast to deep water currents can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you have not yet been caught, or, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Re-entry shock comes earlier than culture shock (there is less of a newcomer period), it persists longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time reconnecting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, people are likely to be patient and tolerant, recognizing that newcomers need time to adjust.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the area's most popular attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you hear the sound of tourists and vendors all the time.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by a number of countries and have the largest number of stations, with seventeen in operation in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 kilometres north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the heat of a still-active volcano has overwhelmed it providing an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsular Mountains here join the plateaus, then reappear to form the 360-kilometre (220 mi) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson massif, culminating in Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not take the place of a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as cruises with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about contacting this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular choice for those planning a year away.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, enabling them to take a year out before going to university, without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year abroad can improve your chances of moving back to higher education in your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrolment in these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boating.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal islands.
In the islands and lakes you do not necessarily need a sailboat.
While the coastal islands and largest lakes are actually large enough for any sailboat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national recreational activity in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic Sea Cruises include an extended stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of days as well as return and sleep on the boat in the evening.
If you only go ashore using boarding passes you will not need a separate visa (in 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or of losing control.
Shipping companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important with business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own airlines, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they had sent things by air transport, on some routes it could have taken days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline's regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, bustling commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more similar to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusually high church.
In the church cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It is worth half an hour to take a walk around the interesting village.
To the north and within easy reach is the very romantic and interesting town of Sintra which was made famous to foreigners after a laudatory report of its splendours by Lord Byron.
Bus 403 Scotturb travels to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north is the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Sanctuary), world famous for Marian apparitions.
Remember, you are visiting a mass grave, as well as a site of immeasurable significance to nearly a quarter of the world's population.
Many men and women are still alive who survived this period, and many more had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Treat the site with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti into structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. About half speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are shown in Catalan only because it has been established by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned interruptions are made in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Pharisees are notorious for being self-centered, rude, and proud.
Although this is often just an incorrect stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, behaving like someone who is "bien éléve" (well brought up).
The boorish manners of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes national park is heavily forested, mainly with pine, spruce and fir trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of micro-climates, different soils and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and wood grouse can be found there, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women are asked to wear skirts over the knees and have something over their shoulders, too.
Most monasteries provide hats for women who come unprepared, but if you bring one of your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Along the same line, men must wear trousers that cover the ankles.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each use so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Food from Majorca, like food from similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and chicken (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular meal, especially during the summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna, ayb.
Each name, next to the word Sie for you, always starts with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It can also be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to detect whether a verb or an adjective is used in the nominative case.
Pronunciation is fairly easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look out for are c and g, as how they are pronounced varies depending on the pronunciation that follows.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means vehicle.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and generally consistent.
So, reading this grammar book would help you understand a lot about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually extinct today, and are used as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not at their height a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been a feature of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, only for himself and other members of the nobility would the emperor host the first cherry blossom parties around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organised garden, collecting "specimens" is also going to get you thrown out, no question.
Singapore is an exceptionally safe place to be in general and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But being located in the "high mountains" a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
A few buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for your holiday.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting towns on the Danube or along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions are also followed by unbelievers who live in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake somewhere outdoors to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian Spring and Fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on a Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that reached the islands originally came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the Galapagos' main grazing animal.
Since the arrival of man to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter you will experience twilight, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not often a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues call each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, emphasising group effort rather than praising individual efforts.
Employees often have to get approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
