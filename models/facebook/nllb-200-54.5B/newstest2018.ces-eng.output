The Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri based on the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP travel advisory for the state of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to exercise increased caution when traveling throughout the state due to a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state", the association said in a statement.
The NAACP cited Missouri's current laws, which make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as law enforcement practices that disproportionately target minorities.
"Civil rights are being violated.
People are being stopped by police because of the color of their skin, attacked or killed", stated Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
"We're getting the highest number of complaints ever".
This is the first warning of its kind the organization has issued for a U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racial slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and police took him into custody without charging him with a crime.
The travel advisory also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's office stating that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should carry bail money with them or notify their relatives that they are going to be traveling across state lines".
According to the latest numbers from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, putting the state 16th among all states.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel advisory for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people based on violations of the law, which the ACLU says is meant to improve racial profiling.
Travel advisories are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family hasn't been able to rest even after 12 years!
The murdered model is Sally Anne Bowman.
A Croydon girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café watching the meticulous forensic work of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
In court, he only admitted to assaulting a juvenile, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing the night of the murder.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after he attacked her, she started screaming".
"She even attracted the attention of taxi drivers", he falsely claimed.
According to his statement, the girl tried to defend herself, but to no avail.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's story was proven false and he was indicted.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about being horny and wanting a girl.
When he put it on after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at her ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, according to Dexie's statement to the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth", added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family is facing further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are people out there who are so cruel that they dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there", the girl's mother Linda told the Mirror.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators can cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prudish nor conservative", says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
You'll find designer and luxury sex toys here.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different", he tells me over lunch.
A friend and an associate decided to work with Fun Factory, a German manufacturer of designer sex toys. Martin was intrigued and offered to help with marketing.
When an associate left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs the boutique Intimity in Prague's Benediktská Street, where she sells erotic accessories in the same way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't he?
They're also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, right?
Come on, don't be such a prude!
Berlin's Fun Factory, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, was the inspiration for Intimity.
It opened in 2010, and it was a very different concept of sex shop than what everyone here is used to.
No hidden displays, everything done in a beautiful, understated style, the products displayed more like in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to conceive the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"After all", she says, "it's about intimacy, and it's also about tenderness".
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went hand in hand with various interior visualisations.
In the end, the winning design was a shop with a pleasure garden and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Stepanova from FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, we didn't think it was ideal because it wasn't on the main street, but then again, it matched the name Intimacy.
It is intimate.
It's in an alley next to the main road, so no one's looking at the customers".
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that was different, with nice branded goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering such a business at all.
When I walked into Intimacy Boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like going to a sex shop.
At the door, I was struck by the sheer elegance of the interior, familiar from the fashion boutiques.
Even though the store is staffed entirely by women, the fact that women feel free to ask for help doesn't mean that men aren't welcome.
This is where most guys come to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Most men don't know how to judge the right size and tend to go for the bigger one", Martin smiles at the common mistake.
It's such a stereotype, such a cliché, that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith might choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men tend to wear black, while women tend to wear pink.
An absolute best seller at the moment is a product aptly named Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
I struggle with an adolescent need to chuckle admiringly at the serious tone of the explanation.
It doesn't look like it's bubbling.
And it doesn't actually frown.
It's reasonably priced and has excellent user reviews.
We didn't think it would be so well received.
It's some kind of revolutionary new thing.
The first revolution was triggered by a vibrator shaped like a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in designing these kinds of products.
The other was a We-Vibe couples vibrator.
He completely shattered the taboo that some men may still hold of seeing sex toys as competition.
"Variations are being made", he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a popular category.
During sexual intercourse, a woman can hold a remote control in her hand and control the intensity of the vibrations.
On the other hand, the category of attachment vibrators is a sure loser.
At least in our house.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose devices and buy conventional vibrators, even though they may only use them externally.
It's very popular in Western Europe, especially with younger customers.
What about the men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it needs to be handled a little differently.
The question is what to offer men", says Martin.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent". The top seller is a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
Instead of looking like an anatomical replica of a vagina, it "looks more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It's very focused on functionality and the user experience.
In Japan, the situation is quite different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were big on sex toys. I disagree.
"That's the reality of the Internet", I'm told.
The regular one's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
Interestingly, Tenga, the Japanese brand represented by Intimity, still accounts for about half of its worldwide sales in Japan alone.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are a generally welcoming nation.
Certainly not in countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical customer is between 35 and 50 years of age and "has had some experience with both sex and paraphernalia.
She comes for something nice, of better quality, to complement her partner's life or for herself". To ensure that she returns, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka make sure that each product is fully functional.
We also don't want to get into the bondage and latex specialties, because we don't have the space for that, and it's just not appropriate.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to reach.
Which are people who have always been too embarrassed to go to a sex shop because they're afraid that something like this is going to pop out at them.
Many of the products on display are genuinely appealing.
This is also reflected in the choice of renowned brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever to be awarded was the seahorse, "and it triggered a change in the whole industry.
They started moving away from cheap materials and working with healthy materials, they started producing different designs, different colors...
Happily, some are designed by the Czech Republic's popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I'm quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy Anna Mares' Whoop.de.doo design stuff here, even though it's relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Anna Mares' Venus balls.
She has done a really great job of presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be made differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school project.
Now it's a finished product, and it's made in-house.
I wanted to be in control of the manufacturing process, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products were made.
Because it's not mass production, it's a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm going a bit against the grain, but I think it's important to keep the development here in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we won't be able to make anything", Anna later describes to me, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more open.
There is no negative or dismissive attitude.
At best, they say, people are confused.
Currently, Anna Marešová offers a vibrator on which you can have a personal message made, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
Next year should see the addition of vibrating eggs and other novelties.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I'm interested in where the boundaries of what's okay lie.
Is there anything Martin Rage doesn't sell anymore?
It's terribly difficult to define.
What's normal to one person may be completely abnormal to another, so we tend to define ourselves by the assortment of brand names.
Neither of them goes to any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they ever got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in from a woman asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a nine-inch penis.
We had to tell her we didn't have anything like that.
I wonder if someone has been playing a joke on us", Martin looks at me suspiciously.
Even that happens from time to time...
It's a shot for Karl Gotti.
After two cancers, Alzheimer's!
His friend Charles the Bold is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend battles a disease that robs people of all their memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true", confirmed the sad information to Blesk the singer himself.
I am aware of my illness, and so far I am coping well under the circumstances.
"I am taking medication to slow down the effects of the disease", he said, thanking his family for their support.
The whole extended family has come together to make Karl's life easier.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, her daughters from her first marriage, Zuzana and Tereza, also visit her father in the White Mountain.
He has battled cancer twice, and he has shared his experience with Nightingale to help him endure the difficult treatment.
She's had 60 rounds of chemo.
He was able to return to work, the tennis court, and the ski slopes.
"My astrologer says I'll be here until I'm 90", said Karl to Blesk.
He is a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song so as not to forget them", admitted Karl.
The actress Květa Fialová is now fighting the same disease in an institution.
Do you have a family member with Alzheimer's?
Look at the way they treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion. The law will be reviewed by the Supreme Court.
In Chile, abortion is still completely banned, even for medical reasons.
"I regret that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing in parliament for more than two years", complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile's Constitutional Court has ten members and is expected to get a new president by the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law lifting the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court, claiming that it violated the right to life of the unborn.
MPs postponed a vote on the bill last month pending analysis by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the House passed the bill, followed by the Senate.
Under the new legislation, abortion would cease to be a criminal offence in three cases: if the woman's life is endangered, if the foetus has no chance of survival or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
According to the Spanish newspaper El País, similar exceptions existed in Chile as early as 1931, even before women were granted the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world with a total ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, some 20 women are now behind bars, serving sentences of up to 30 years for abortions.
According to human rights advocates, many of these cases were spontaneous abortions that the courts classified as murders.
Is anything sacred anymore?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty.
Criticism of statues is a sure sign of regime change.
Americans could tell the story as well as anyone - see the carefully staged toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, a key supporter of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was getting into when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
It's only fair to add that Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
He'd be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty wannabes.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that a plaque with Emma Lazarus' famous poem was placed on the pedestal in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, "I don't want to get into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem, which was placed on the pedestal afterwards, and to which you refer, is not part of it".
Miller's factually correct, but as he pointed out, this isn't about history.
Above all, the striking words of Emma Lazarus resonate today - an invitation not just to immigrants, but to the poorest of the poor: 'Come to me, you who are downtrodden, you who are poor, you who can hardly breathe freely, you miserable worms in the midst of crowded cities.'
And it is in modern times that we can see these "miserable worms" more than ever on our screens.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people were not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's essentially a conflict over the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who sought to place a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue after her death, knew well enough that she was playing a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of French and American republican governments by representing the classical theme of the female embodiment of liberty.
Emma Lazarus altered this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name, Mother of Exiles.
Merging poetry with the idea of womanhood is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Noted commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty marches forward.
He carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States".
Limbaugh strangely alludes to an important point.
The meaning of the statue depends on your point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the sculpture from the perspective of an exhausted and doomed traveler who, after a long and often terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart in a new land.
It's literally about seeing the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings the praises of the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletics chief executive Neil Black said that a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup squad would be a "huge asset to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the London 2017 Olympic Games, which begin on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland and that British athletics could learn a thing or two from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we'll work on that", Black said.
"I've spoken to people from the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish Athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
That's what the people on the street think too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely wonderful".
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been named team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening remarks were amazing", said Black.
"Several athletes, both Scottish and of other nationalities, left the room feeling immensely proud and motivated.
The passion and raw emotion with which Eilidh spoke was unparalleled".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "unbelievable" to have 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Middle distance runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
At the World Championships, she will compete in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another great Scotsman is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m, having won the British Team Championships and the Commonwealth Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where the only other Scottish member of the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that many of her teammates not only made the team, but in many cases will also be competing for the finals and medals.
'What is unusual about being team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It shows how far we've come.
These are athletes who will be thinking about the front of the stage.
What about my opening statement?
Yes, I think it went well.
I merely pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home soil.
It's important to use the support of the home fans and enjoy the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for office if you can't take criticism from voters
The father of our country knew his critics.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start criticizing him for everything from his domestic policies to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him indifferent.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken from us - and dumb and dumb we will be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his alleged actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as baseless, and there were many "who cares" comments online.
"It's just Facebook", said many users.
It matters, though.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In a perfectly democratic state, this is a hugely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second highest approval rating of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irritable.
As you can see, he governs his state with self-confidence and strict adherence to principle.
He has also proven adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents - including posting the first photo of his bare head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people from visiting the governor's website - which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by his taxpayer-funded staff - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments was done from a moderating position.
But using the image of Internet trolls or spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, not trolls.
As they all stated, their comments were polite and considerate, not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comments, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie's lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, M.D. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely pointed out that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other breaking news", she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam interest", others would probably call "advocacy".
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required sending officials into the streets to collect and burn all critical literature or to arrest or silence protesters.
And that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris, when she blocked a voter from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be too difficult.
In Washington's day, cheap postage had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and many anonymous writers challenged his leadership.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius", wrote letters to newspapers questioning Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piling up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader must embrace that.
Czechs have been quick to take advantage of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
Czechs consume more of their tariff abroad than at home.
Austria is the most frequent destination, but Croatia leads in data consumption during the summer season.
On vacation, they have more time to surf the Web and are less likely to be able to connect to Wi-Fi under a parasol.
The beach, swimming and a smartphone in your hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to recent statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data at their disposal than at home.
Not surprisingly, in Croatia, which has the lowest number of visitors in the winter, data use increased 50-fold this summer.
Italy came in second in terms of data consumption.
The highest number of minutes is called from Germany, where many Czechs travel for work even during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agents, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
But here, people have traded books for sharing experiences on their mobile phones.
The record was set on July 7th of this year.
'Tens of millions of photographs could fit into the transmitted data,' explained Silvia Cieslar, Head of Mobile at O2.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We're going to Austria for a hiking and active vacation where we don't have so much time to surf the Internet.
"Moreover, Czechs are heading for the Adriatic through Austria", explained Cieslarová.
While for data the operator has seen high year-on-year growth since the liberalisation of roaming charges, for voice calls the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming doubled compared to last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
'Corporate customers are more likely to use roaming calls when they are travelling for work', added Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a homey atmosphere at the Renaissance Club.
Former number one golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, which is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland and lost to Paul Eales on his way to the final at nearby Archerfield Links last year, will serve as tournament ambassador this year on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes, and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty", said Rafferty.
"Players will be able to enjoy a first-class playing surface.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent advocate of the game and takes pride in his accomplishments.
This year's tournament is in good hands".
England's Eales will be defending his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it", said the Southport golfer.
"I didn't have the chance to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the year after I won, the tournament was canceled.
It's magical to be back in this part of the country.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when it meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon to win.
It was a wonderful time that I will never forget".
Returning to home turf is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home", Orr said of Helensburg.
"You want to do well, but there's a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far".
The trio will be joined on the court by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the course; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free and parking is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses the frying pan.
In her wooden hut in Paniai Enarotali, the capital of Indonesia's Papua province, a woman usually just throws a sweet potato - "nota" in the local language - onto the fire.
After half an hour, he takes the potato out and enjoys eating it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the house has no furniture - while doing her daily chores, such as washing clothes in muddy water from a nearby swamp.
In a room without a roof, a bucket serves as a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned a field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night is dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"After five o'clock in the afternoon, no one dares to wander around the village", says Bardina.
It's a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1,026 elders were forced to vote by a public show of hands in front of the occupying army.
The contemporary movement protesting Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern half of the island.
Enarotali is so remote and desolate that it can be reached by a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, followed by a five-hour stomach-churning drive.
Public transportation doesn't work in this area.
The town of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with gray and rust-colored corrugated iron roofs.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have visited the site, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the local people worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes", says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark shirt, and bright skirt.
"Before, we only carried leaves".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But at the same time, Indonesia is the land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, Arizona, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of logging.
For the Papuans, however, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 New York Times investigation found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
Papuans calling for self-rule are threatening this golden goose and are being severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in the Papuan tribal region during the 1970's amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes atrocities that took place last year as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report - and a brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to count the number of casualties because the incidents happen every week", said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
To make matters worse, Papua's resources are attracting settlers to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million people, 83 percent claim to be Christian, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixture of vegetables and peanut sauce.
The locals are struggling to survive.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans", explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, to work.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - the mama-mama (women) - thus lost their jobs".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured passage to the presidential palace in Jakarta from 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But little has changed in Papua, and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice", You said.
The reality is that just two months after Jakowi's inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas carols around a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the night.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn on the lights.
One soldier was moved by the rebuke and the tone of voice, and he later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers, intoxicated, chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their weapons, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby election commission building, and things escalated the next day.
Some 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a soccer field outside the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita - a circle dance imitating the song of birds - of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua New Guinea.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the buildings.
As tensions mounted, soldiers were ordered over the radio: "If the crowd attempts to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot", said an official document, the contents of which have never been made public in the local media, according to TIME magazine.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the danger and urged residents to return to their homes.
But no one was to heed his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist", he told TIME from the porch of his brightly painted wooden home.
Kayama still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting", he added.
One local resident, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him", Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME in a somber voice.
"I saw he was dead... and I kissed him".
Papua's police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely "securing" the station, which was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death", Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the murders was all over the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again", he said.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children in Ituri from 2002 to 2003.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be made.
"Most acts of violence happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990's and some in the early 2000's.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task", he said.
However, in a June 5 interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he had no plans to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought to trial".
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" over more than a thousand deaths during East Timor's 1999 independent elections, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai shooting victims greeted his claim with disbelief.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but so far I haven't received anything", said Yohanes.
"I'm tired of it".
Years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid", as he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the army or shot".
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me", he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in nearby Deiyai.
The clash, which left one person dead and 17 others injured, was between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at them and fired warning shots in response.
However, locals claim that the Mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation", Domingu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded arrive, told TIME.
"I didn't leave the house for two days".
Deiya's parliament demanded that the police involved be punished and that the mobile brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the isolation of the indigenous Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal people who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (PLM), a rebel army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of attacks in recent years, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of them no one will ever see again.
Paniai is known among Papuans as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty adds fuel to the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
The inhabitants grow their own food - mainly sweet potatoes, fruit, and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields, each cultivating four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is consumed by the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the opening of Nabire airport and the influx of new immigrants into the country, economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants has increased.
Already scarce jobs tend to be filled by better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education needed to start a business.
"Young people are moving out of the villages because of lack of jobs and money", said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Due to its isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite being granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi campaigned on promises to end restrictions on journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"Foreign journalists working in the restive easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua face a high risk of visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of reporting by foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia over Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia is still a democracy and the media is free, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations".
Locals are calling for foreign governments to get involved.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals chanted "we want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but asked not to be named.
Indonesia is scheduled to hold another election in 2019, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people linked to the Paniai shooting", said Gobau, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - besides living in constant fear of a marauding army - are mired in poverty, poor education and healthcare.
Gobai claims that Paniai residents, like other Papuans, see their vote as a "debt" to Jokowi.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he added.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniagua shooting continue with a final symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims in a plot across from the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", said Yacobus, his head bowed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine bound for Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth approximately $256 million.
The shipment was bound for Australia.
During the operation, the four-member crew of the ship, believed to be of Lithuanian and Latvian nationality, were arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, had set sail from South America and, after being seized by police, was towed to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were coming from and where they were going, and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large quantities of drugs going to Australia", said Col Blanch, its executive director.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumea.
High street prices make Australia an attractive target for drug traffickers.
The country also faces the problem of a growing number of drug addicts.
The current raid is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, attempting to smuggle them across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
According to Pavla Mádlová, a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, the solution could be infusions of saline solution, which are injected under the skin with a thin needle.
But they're only used in healthcare settings.
As a person ages, the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, they lose their thirst sensation, so they generally drink less and become dehydrated very quickly", said Mádlová.
They should definitely drink two liters.
"But getting that much fluid into an old person is a big problem", she added.
In nursing homes, she says, there is often no doctor in sight.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with IV fluids.
"I think it should be phased in there as well so they can get the subcutaneous infusion", she said.
According to her, up to two pint bottles of saline can be given to the elderly each day.
Lack of fluids can cause drowsiness, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks incoherently", she added.
If neglected, it can even result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs a blood vessel in the brain, which can lead to kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, preferably a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursing", she said, "but the ideal would be to expose the patient occasionally and let the skin breathe".
For the second time, The Torch burned in Dubai.
In Dubai, fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers on Friday, forcing firefighters to evacuate all occupants of the 1,100-foot-high [337 m], 79-story building.
This is the second fire in two years at the high-rise, aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building have been evacuated and no injuries have been reported.
"We were asleep when the alarm went off and we heard screaming.
It took us 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor", one resident, George, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters brought the blaze under control at about 04:00 (01:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they were providing alternative accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could reignite debate about the safety of materials used to clad tall buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged were the cladding and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police say that the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that killed nearly 80 people in June.
Surveys show that more than 1 in 5 travelers to the United States takes banned items on an airplane
A survey of passengers revealed that more than 20 percent had knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, and at least 6 percent had boarded a plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than 1 percent of the travelers said that they discovered too late that they were carrying firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - with more than 1,000 respondents - revealed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to travel with an item prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand hours of flight time, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items to escape TSA scrutiny are food and alcohol.
More than 3 percent of the respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women and 3.7 percent of the men polled also admitted to having deliberately brought illicit drugs on board.
The company said that it conducted a survey of travelers worldwide to find out how many accidentally brought illegal items through airport security and how many did so intentionally.
Not surprisingly, most people who have carried illegal items - whether knowingly or unknowingly - travel by air frequently.
As the company pointed out, TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and how much they can take on an airplane.
Not surprisingly, the TSA seized the largest amount of illicit liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA would treat books the same way they treat contraband.
Carriage of liquids is permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
EPA head Scott Pruitt on the delay of the Obama administration's planned emissions reduction guidelines
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its head Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan that make it more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he made no mention of a legal challenge to his former position before a federal appeals court.
This concerns the deadline of 1 October for countries to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interfering with local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump to head the EPA, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since taking office in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly pushed back or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt reversal is the biggest legal setback yet for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane emissions.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through a comprehensive process and meeting the new standards within a set time frame.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settlements and rescheduling", said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in regulating through litigation and we take meeting deadlines seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it".
However, the EPA statement notes that Pruitt may at some point use "the power of delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "are based on sound policy and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive overhaul of ozone regulations.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group would not cave in to legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution", added Schneiderman.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common pollutants released by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in susceptible people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are applauding Pruitt's sudden change of heart.
"It's alarming how much pressure it takes to change minds and protect the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to help polluters and special interests".
He threw acid on a man, yet the courts say he's not dangerous.
You never know what's gonna happen.
One minute, you're at home with your family, laughing, and the next, your whole life changes.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christoforos of Great Britain, whose face was attacked with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The news was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, there was a knock on the Christopheros' door.
Andreas got up to answer the door.
He assumed that a courier was at the door to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he'd never seen before poured acid on it without warning and said, "This is for you, buddy".
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell off me like nothing, and all I felt was excruciating pain in my skin", said Andreas.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there they received devastating news - the doctors had given him up for dead!
For weeks after the incident, doctors worried constantly that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to seep into his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent involved the face, which doctors tried to rebuild using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most excruciating thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes", he described his ordeal.
Today, Christopheros has undergone 12 operations, and he is far from finished.
According to plastic surgeons, the injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after intensive, long-term treatment, victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people never recover and struggle with deformity and disfigurement for the rest of their lives", said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
The attacker made a mistake.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on the man who sexually abused his loved one.
Police investigated the case thoroughly and eventually tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
Later, however, the verdict was reversed, much to the astonishment of Christopheros' family.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be quashed because the man is not considered a threat to the public", said Christopheros.
In the last few years, the number of attacks by corrosive substances has increased considerably.
The Ministry of the Interior has commented that it plans to establish new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosive substances.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks, however, are not about to give up.
They are demanding that the UK government enforce tougher and longer prison sentences for people who attack their neighbours with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in shops as different cleaning products.
The Torch, one of the world's largest residential buildings, burned last night in Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates.
According to Dubai Civil Defence, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to several residents, however, the opposite was true.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us", said one of the tenants.
Also according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We were woken by an alarm, people screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor", said George, a tenant.
Another witness told CNN that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, the fire was brought under control, according to the civil defense.
The cause is still unknown.
Witnesses reported power outages in nearby buildings.
An extensive fire damaged The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There's about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was hurt because the inhabitants were evacuated in time.
The Torch was completed in 2011 and became the world's tallest residential building at 1,162 feet (352 m).
The record was broken the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 performance-enhancing drugs in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Serra, 23-year-old Ippolito's sample contained a wide range of illegal substances - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease and anorexia.
Ironically, even this wild mix didn't help him to the title, finishing fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year suspension and criminal charges.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a then-record number for any athlete caught.
The minor leaguer said he started taking steroids the year before when he fell for a bodybuilder.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic. I've never seen her before in my life.
She was in a passionate embrace with her former lover!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková set foot in the Czech Republic, she is in a circle.
He also attracts attention wherever he goes.
The last person to fall into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she had lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older then and already yearning for a family.
At just 19 years of age, Lucía had no desire to give up her career.
So they separated, but they remain friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both matched in blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became close and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until her stomach hurt.
Then they hugged and posed for photographs.
Their meeting wasn't a coincidence, though, as they're set to play a couple in love in Prima's new series Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given life sentences in Britain for plotting an attack.
A British court on Thursday jailed for life four members of an Islamist cell calling itself the Three Musketeers who prosecutors said were planning a terrorist attack against the police and army.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previous convictions for similar offences, were arrested last August.
Authorities at the time believed he was preparing an imminent attack.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially constructed pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbeliever" in Arabic, and a replica pistol.
It happened when an MI5 agent planted a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror the defendants could cause if they were not stopped", said Assistant District Attorney Sue Hemming.
Three inmates aged 28, 25 and 33 are eligible for parole after 20 years.
The fourth convict, a 38-year-old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
The men claimed during their trial in London that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been planted by an MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In the Hodonín region, they measured 38.3 degrees Celsius.
Tuesday's temperature record of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit only lasted two days at its peak.
With a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit [38.3°C], recorded at Watchtower Farms, it was surpassed on Thursday, making it the hottest day so far this year.
This has been confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But unlike Tuesday, not many temperature records were broken on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equalled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term monitoring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Watchtower, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice near Břeclavsk, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice near Brno, today's 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the Watchtower, were from 2013.
It was ten degrees cooler in the west.
High temperatures on Thursday occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the hottest places were Dyjakovice in Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclav region, where the mercury reached 37.8 degrees Celsius, but the record was not broken.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, Thursday's high temperatures were only about 72 degrees Fahrenheit [22°C], according to the Czech Meteorological Institute website.
"Temperatures did not begin to rise there until later this afternoon", the weather service reported.
According to the Czech Meteorological Office, the current heat wave in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of the visa policy.
For decades, China has sought to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry into foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
That's what's wrong with Beijing.
State media there are talking about a plan to make tourism a driver of economic transformation and modernization.
However, arrivals grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of the tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
For all its global aspirations, China is not exactly welcoming to foreigners, according to Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Peking University, in an article for Bloomberg.
The most telling example is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free access to China, the citizens of the others must obtain a visa in advance.
As a result, crowds at Chinese consulates in the United States are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you do not want to wait in line for hours, you may have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the visa requirement reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's GDP and less than one percent of its population.
China often exacerbates the problem when it uses tourism to advance its political goals, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted shipments to South Korea this spring in a dispute over South Korea's missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated by shunning China.
In May, the number of visits dropped 42 percent year on year, while Japan saw an 85 percent increase.
All this has an impact on macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent U.S. Federal Reserve report, as much as $190 billion may have left China as a result of Chinese travel abroad, while China earns about $35 billion annually from foreign exchange sales to inbound tourists.
According to official balance-of-payments figures, China ran a $217-billion deficit in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of its entire merchandise trade surplus.
Thus, the low number of tourists deals a severe blow to a country anxious to prevent capital flight.
The above factors, however, are only one manifestation of a more general restraint toward foreigners.
In many parts of China, immigrants are virtually unheard of.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in all of China.
Individual cities in the United States have several.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
Many studies show that immigrants tend to stimulate economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China, however, they are practically nonexistent.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but a step forward is the simplification of the visa regime.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
The Plzeň zoo has bred deadly poisonous reptiles.
Plzeň's Kingdom of Poison can now enjoy the offspring of three rare, deadly reptiles.
Visitors to the exhibit will see only all nine newborn turkey vultures.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"It grows to a length of several metres", explains zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
Meanwhile, the cubs of the other two species, the death adder and the red cobra, will gather strength in the garden's nursery.
We can't tell yet when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them", said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight of Australia's death adders have been born to a breeding pair from a population around Sydney.
"The one that visitors can see in the exhibition is a death adder from the Perth area", said Vobruba, adding that in human care, death adders need to hibernate for six to eight weeks at 55 degrees Fahrenheit [13°C].
A litter of African red spitting cobras had a 100% success rate.
A pair at the Plzeň Zoo hatched four offspring from four eggs.
"The incubation period was 65 days", Sparrow added.
In the wild, this species sprays venom at its victims from up to 13 feet [4 m] away.
It targets the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on mouse droppings at the zoo.
After 40 days in the garden, they still await the hatching of a brood of black mambas, their eggs stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone call, Trump is pressuring Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The U.S. president rebuked him for publicly condemning the wall, reportedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press".
Trump campaigned on a promise to build a wall along the southern border and said Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked, revealing a tense exchange.
President Trump told Turnbull that a deal to have the US oversee refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal - which came out of the Obama administration - he would look "drugged" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is the most unpleasant call I've had all day".
Tusk testified again to the prosecutor about Smolensk.
"He has something to be afraid of", Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the president's brother and chairman of the ruling Law and Justice party, told Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me", Tusk replied, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse the judiciary against political opponents.
According to TVN 24, a crowd was waiting for Tusk as he left the prosecutor's office, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and I will not be intimidated by Kaczyński".
He says he doesn't blame the prosecutors, but he doesn't doubt that the judiciary is a tool for Poland's current rulers to use against rivals, opponents or people they don't like, and I'm afraid I'm one of them.
This is the second time he's been questioned.
The ex-Prime Minister was questioned by the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the questioning was related to errors in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins were switched.
The families were forbidden to open the coffins, and there must have been a reason.
And the reason was they were afraid of a scandal because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU", Kaczyński claimed on Catholic TV station Trwam.
He added that a conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the EU's most important seat, which Poland has none of.
Kaczyński also stated that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could turn out differently, but she did not acknowledge it.
Tusk was questioned for eight hours at the prosecutor's office on 19 April.
Even then, he wasn't testifying as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw the summons as part of an apparent attempt by the Polish government and PiS leader Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The summons for questioning came shortly after Tusk's election as head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but failed to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
In the end, only the Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone at the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has also let Warsaw down.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn's parliamentary elections, registered voters will once again be able to vote for the members of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It's in the ordinance that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, which is currently under review.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens abroad voted for MEPs.
'Since the last amendment of the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists', the Ministry justifies its action.
"In some countries, new embassies have been established, some have been closed, or the level of representation has changed", the report says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are to be delivered.
This group of offices includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred other Czech offices will receive a printed version of the ballot.
It's their list that's being changed by executive order.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its missions in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
In taking on and acting in this capacity, he has therefore actively supported actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and further destabilised Ukraine.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
New additions to the list are embassies in Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation with a consulate-general in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan province.
Ballots will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect MPs at polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the National Electoral Committee shall draw lots to determine which region's candidates are to be voted for abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided between South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs abroad voted for South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
When it opened 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote. In 2006, there were about 6,700. Four years later, 8,222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters went to the embassies.
Massacre at Moore's Ford Bridge: activists remember racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past a crowd of onlookers in Monroe, Georgia, and sped toward the Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car with four black passengers and a white driver reached the bridge, however, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - took a long drag on his cigarette and stared into the windshield.
Inside, the passengers were trembling with fear.
"We want that nigger Roger!" shouted the man.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence is broken by the screams of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reenactment of the events of July 22.
But when one of the men throws the noose around "Roger's" neck, the audience gasps with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists has regularly returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has ever been prosecuted for the murders.
"It's strange that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reenactment.
"It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reenactment is a dramatic call to action, an annual reminder to the Monroe community that justice has not been served.
"We demand prosecution and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all", Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin".
A medical examiner covers one of the bodies of a lynching victim at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, as many as 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were involved in the lynching.
However, no one has ever been prosecuted.
Although the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates claim that the two motives for the lynching - politics and sex - were well-known to all the townspeople.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that blacks in the state of Georgia could vote for the first time in elections scheduled for that summer.
And just in time for this summer's election, the FBI says a black farmer named Roger Malcom allegedly stabbed a white landowner named Barnett Hester during an altercation over his wife.
There was a rumor in town, according to Brooks, that Hester had intercourse with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and impregnated her.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Loy Harrison posted $600 bail for Malcolm.
Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
On their way back from the prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, they were blocked by a group of suspects.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison", the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement who not only participated in the lynching but also disposed of the evidence and concealed the identities of the witnesses".
Brooks was more succinct about the whole thing.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote", he said.
"The murders sent a clear message to all local black residents: 'This is what happens when you register and vote.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has organized an annual reenactment of the events at Moore's Ford Bridge.
Her performance is vivid, engaging and succinct, exposing a deep-seated racism that many would like to see eradicated from modern America.
It's not easy to watch this reconstruction, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because it forces us to confront the uncomfortable feelings that lurk in all of us", said Greene.
"But we can't have a relationship until you hear what I've been through".
The main rehearsals for this year's revival began in June, and on the very first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - swarmed into the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting assistant director.
He's played the leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but he says the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am", Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to be reminded of this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time".
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascone, who play Roger Malcolm, aka Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show opens with a scuffle - Malcolm arguing with Hester and accusing him of sleeping with his wife.
"Get the f--- off my property!"
You can't have Rascona.
There's a skirmish.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts out laughing.
Greene has the biggest laugh of anyone.
"What happened?" asks the Rascona.
He is confused.
Was I too harsh?
"No", says Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--r' in that tone back then".
"Exactly", says one of the black actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on the R".
The energy in the room suddenly improves; hostility gives way to a feeling of closeness.
Everybody wants the show to be authentic, if only to make up for the four massacre victims.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the N-word.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the mournful Billie Holiday song "Strange Fruit".
There's a sadness in the room with every word.
In the background, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, and many of the spectators are local.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in procession to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until this point, the murders could be viewed from a distance, but now, standing on the very spot where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is eerie.
With the final words of the song, Greene challenges the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Kids kneel by their victims' heads, watch the fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper in each other's ears.
"They're not dead", mutters the little boy.
A few minutes go by, and Greene thanks the audience.
The actors are cleaning the rope and wiping their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascon hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; eventually, he is overcome with emotion.
"It's all right", one of the women whispers.
"We know you don't like the part.
But you did it for a reason".
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking excitedly about a performance with a black couple they met earlier in the day.
Denise Duplinski could barely find the words to express how she felt about tonight's performance.
"It's hard to listen to the ugly words and see the ugly deeds... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you", she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a hot topic", she added, "it's just called police brutality".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in a courtroom, enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he's already started planning next year's show.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to live through - but it is also a moment for reflection", he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
A people who do not know and do not learn the history of their country are condemned to repeat it".
I love instruction manuals.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads a manual.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's a modern art form, often pure surrealism.
I'm nostalgic for a time long past when instructions for anything were a rare commodity.
For example, my first phonograph consisted of a single sheet of paper with hieroglyphics on it showing the connections between the various parts, all with secret symbols.
Years later, when something inside me broke, I offered the deed to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back panel.
With a grin, he told me what the paper with the maze of lines was for.
Yes, it was a common remedy for chronic toilet paper depletion.
He easily found the disconnected wire and enabled me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
A new age has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple juicer, where you just stuck a sliced grapefruit in, required about ten pictures.
Especially well done was the sketch that described how to insert one piece into another.
The kit was a two-piece, and there was simply no other way.
Turning it upside down required considerable effort, requiring the removal of certain plastic parts.
My contempt for the manual ended with my Seat Leon.
In the 2003 model year, it still had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including changing the indicator bulb.
It was simple.
Just three steps and the work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author neglected to mention that while the light bulb on the right was replaceable, it really only took three steps.
One, remove the cover.
Two, unscrew the broken bulb and screw in a new one.
Three, pull up the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the placement of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting my right upper limb into the interior of the car, I would find a spring or a screw that would easily remove the cover, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
It's the footbridge.
There was no room in that shelter, no room even for Cinderella's slender hand, let alone Spleen's obese one.
I've wasted half an hour of my life, and with absolutely no success.
The situation was exacerbated by the entrance of my wife into the garage, summoned by a roar and words that she rarely hears from me.
"What are you doing here?" she asked coldly.
My answer took about 90 seconds, but if I leave out the vulgar terms, there are only two words left to publish.
I'm changing the bulb.
"What's taking you so long?" she ventured what might be her last sentence in a long-term relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing mainly on the method of torture of the manual's author, where the blessing of the hand that wrote the manual with a red-hot iron, then wiping it away so that he could never write again, was merely an introduction to a wide range of the Hammer of Witches manuals, including his commissioned burning on a hill above Lošinj Castle.
"Why don't you take the box apart?" the woman said, not taking the battery apart.
Out of sheer desperation, this happened, and then steps one through three were just as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until one day, I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a collapse after being inspected by two FDA officials.
I know him as a colleague who is balanced, who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell even wild stories in a calm voice.
"Imagine being fined for not posting handwashing instructions", he said in a weak voice.
I gradually extracted from him the whole problem, which was that he didn't have a picture of how to wash his hands above the sink in the patients' bathroom.
His argument to the Commission official that adults can usually wash their hands and that they do not need pictograms to perform the usual activities of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that", she told him.
He understood that the simple act of washing soaped hands with running water was a primitive act at the Cro-Magnon level, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this rite in ten steps.
For example, it is necessary to communicate that it is necessary to turn on the tap.
There are 11 steps in the process, but at the end of it, you'll be happy to know that you washed your hands exactly as prescribed by the F.D.A.
In conclusion, I must say that I have been inspired to prepare a detailed plan of action for the toilet.
In the case of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, due to certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
The pictograms remain a problem, for creating the perfect procedure involves drawing all the anatomical details with precision, which might cause some indignation in the prudish toilet visitor, even though he may finally learn that he has spent his whole life wiping the hole completely wrong.
Pearson is laying off another 3,000 employees and cutting its dividend in an effort to revive business.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change its business model.
The next wave of redundancies, which CEO John Fallon has indicated will take place in late 2018 and early 2019, follows the company's previous decision to lay off 4000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme in an attempt to revive a declining business due to the boom in digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said its outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a 1% rise in underlying sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, according to a NATO statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bombing that killed more than 30 people at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol along with members of the Afghan military were attacked by "a local individual with a homemade explosive device".
The statement added that all the wounded soldiers are out of danger and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to intelligence sources, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a significant source of concern for the NATO-led forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a Shia neighbourhood of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On 31 May, a large explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining an already precarious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to assist military and police forces in the country.
According to news reports, the suicide attacks he has instigated in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reversed its decision to delay the smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration's law requiring states to reduce emissions just one day after 15 states sued the agency.
In the wee hours of Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to refer the 2015 Ozone Standards, saying that it presented the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views", EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's effort to delay the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and use the measurements to set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen mostly Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday alleging that the EPA's actions are illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to roll back many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in what Trump says was an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new administration's efforts have sparked a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
According to the EPA Web site, breathing ozone-laden air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav the Drummer was hit and bled!
This relatively new singer in our country, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event for Czech conditions, where he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show themselves to the public and present their music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by the celebrities just named.
Few people know, however, that the shooting of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it didn't come without its fair share of embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
To make the scene more dramatic, the video had the singer's juice indicate a slap.
At one point, however, he struck the young singer so hard and directly on the nose that he had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose immediately started bleeding", commented Ladislav.
Colleagues and producers on the set said it was an accident and Ladislav didn't react in time.
Fortunately, the injury wasn't serious enough to affect the rest of the shoot.
We now bring you the aforementioned video clip of the young artist, you can also record the punch scene in it.
The unsuccessful blood version, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko were discussing the possibility of a rematch.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, the two fighters who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match ever, met for the first time on Tuesday.
Each was in a separate room at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council - came down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's unanimous decision victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime fight, both fighters moved into the top five in the lightweight division.
Garcia threw his right and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you".
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN this Saturday at 7:00.
The fighters pose for photographs and Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be the "perfect test".
"I am a former featherweight champion", adds Garcia.
"I had to put on weight for the Broner fight, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140 pounds.
I'd like to return to the lightweight division.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to get to lightweight... then we can fight.
He's pining for that fan.
Why not give it to them?"
Lomachenko is on board.
"Boxing could use a good fight".
Klimas has raised the pay-per-view requirement - part of his strategy - for Lomachenko to make his lightweight debut later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next year, who has also expressed interest in facing the winner of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell for the lightweight title on September 23 at the Forum.
"The game should be pay-per-view, that's what the fans want", said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of the game being broadcast by the network that comes up with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else is gonna draw that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity"...
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and would attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was undeterred by Garcia's praise, saying the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout".
Garcia said his goal was to show strength before boxing.
Both fighters said they felt the tension rising between them.
"This is a game you won't soon forget.
No other fight gets this much attention.
And I'll take great pleasure in putting it in the fire", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and this is Mikey".
It's going to be a great game".
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
They just found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched, but to no avail.
And the police eventually closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived with the uncertainty of never knowing what happened to them.
After 12 years, there was a sad ending to the whole story.
The wreckage of their car was found by a diver at the bottom of the Volga River in Cheboksary, Chuvash Republic.
It was only through the identification papers left in the car that the police were able to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without which it would have taken the police much longer to identify the bodies.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed his father's car to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for now.
He reported his find to the Cheboksary police, who towed the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by an icy road running alongside the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be published when it is completed.
Recent results of tests to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people interviewed were over 18, but not everyone trusts their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started new tests earlier this year.
The measure was introduced after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has referred 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged the interviewee to be "possibly over 18".
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests shall only be used if the age of the interviewee is in dispute.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are stuck in a rut and the numbers are very similar", he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, "the respondent was 18 years of age or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would turn 18 this year.
Also criticized is the medical method of age determination, which involves X-rays of the wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are then evaluated by dentists and radiologists.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes measuring biological maturity to determine the age at which a person reaches puberty.
"I've had reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of measurements to judge age are right.
Biological age assessment is in some ways very uncertain.
If we can't give an accurate age, we shouldn't pretend otherwise", he told the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the decision, saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
The highest risk is posed by the fact that the respondent is just under 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents".
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
In a January phone call, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened not to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto if he publicly stated that his country would not pay for a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged, though he admitted it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke candidly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
That's according to transcripts of interviews published Thursday by The Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of his major campaign promises last year.
In his first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump gave Pena Nieto an undiplomatic rebuke for being critical of his wall plan.
He portrayed his southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this", Trump said repeatedly in the January 27 interview, threatening to cut off contact with the Mexican president if he continued to issue defiant statements.
He said the financing would be worked out and it would be fine in the end.
"But if you're going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet with you guys anymore because it's unacceptable to me", Trump said, according to the New York Times.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after he took office.
Mexico's refusal to build or finance the 2,000-mile-long [3,200 km] wall has also strained relations.
In late March, Trump said the United States would pay for the project for the time being.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House chief of staff called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted to reach this conclusion by an exchange of views on a deal in which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting people from detention centers in Pacific island nations.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say this is not the deal you made, but you will have to stick to it", Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, such as when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving by boat as a good idea.
"You're worse than me", Trump joked.
Suddenly, though, the tone of the conversation changed.
"I hate receiving these people", Trump remarked.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They're not going to be great people who go to work for the local dairy", he said.
He also said in the interview that a fugitive could become the Boston bomber in five years.
In late January, about a week after entering the White House, Trump had phone conversations with a number of world leaders, often several in one day.
He ended up calling Turnbull the least pleasant call he'd had all day.
Before ending it, he pointed out that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place in a public square in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi targeted a little girl named Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body and dumped it near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has shocked the entire country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a crowd of thousands who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father expressed his feelings to the media after the execution.
I feel like a new man.
Well, that's a relief.
It's a new day in my life.
Other family members were also present, shouting "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square in a police van from which he was dragged.
The officers tied him up and laid him on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd cheered as each shot was fired.
Mr Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed", he added.
I was standing in Sana'a's Liberation Square waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rani's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been served.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a frenzy of hatred and the murderer would be seized and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court run by the Shia Houthis.
Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions sparked such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his home, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What would be his motive?
An animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries on Rana's body were horrific", he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture were everywhere", he continued.
Everyone believes that the police got a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other neighborhood kids.
After 10 or 15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Yemeni citizens were outraged by the crime and began gathering outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Justice Department read a transcript of the hearing to calm the crowd.
The defendant appears to have shown no remorse for his actions.
Just before the execution, the police read the sentence, but the condemned man merely glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many videos taken by the crowd have surfaced on the Internet.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a change of political party.
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at President Trump's rally Thursday night that he's switching parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today I say to you as a citizen of West Virginia that I can no longer support you as the Democratic governor".
The crowd of onlookers erupted in joy.
"Tomorrow I will be joining the Republicans", Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to move on to another game".
Trump had earlier promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the entire country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
His net worth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's defection is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our path instead of uplifting our country".
"For a Democratic Party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is the final straw for an already beleaguered, leaderless party struggling in vain to find a positive and unifying message", RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe has praised Russia's "sincere" apology for the doping scandal.
Former star athlete Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised Russia for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time for Russia to return to the world of sport.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF congress - held on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that his country's ban from world sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all the athletes who have lost their gold and silver medals in this way".
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found Russia had encouraged doping of its athletes.
"I think what we saw today was a very honest response and presentation", IAAF president Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has acknowledged its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation".
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today was a great success and we've moved to the next stage, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation to maintain the sanctions imposed on Russia", Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest", he concluded.
At the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag, following strict IAAF rules.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
The drug tests are still inconclusive and the suspended coaches are continuing their work, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to the firm of František Savov, who is being prosecuted by the state.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials gave him a perfect score on all qualitative criteria.
They didn't mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and requesting his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the Export Promotion Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, launched a four-year public tender to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract with a total value of 30.8 million crowns was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta of businessman František Savov.
He was charged by the Czech police in 2014 with tax evasion and is currently on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is seeking his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
According to CzechTrade's original criteria, 60 percent of the award was to be decided by the price offered and the remaining 40 percent by a beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
It was the latter criterion that significantly helped Savova's company.
According to the information provided, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-criteria of quality.
This is what pushed her ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of 404 900 crowns per month, the VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the judges in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server, is part of the Economia publishing house.
The VLM publishing house lodged several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its evaluation unfair and insufficiently reasoned.
Following their rejection, it was decided to challenge the tender before the Office for the Protection of Competition of the OPCOM.
It considers that CzechTrade acted unlawfully.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public contract supplier on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the applicant and other suppliers", reads the proposal to initiate proceedings submitted to the Office of Public Works this week, which was published by the Aktuálně server.
According to the CEO and chairman of the board of VLM, Michal Klima, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be unreliable and the 100% evaluation of the Young Front project by all its members is extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious", he told Aktuálně Klima.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All the information concerning the contract you mention is published in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"A full written report will be published after the end of the contract, but we cannot comment on its progress during the contract", the agency's media representative Štěpán Dlouhý told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta reacted with a statement that it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that Article.
The fact that she had been providing editorial services to BusinessInfo for the previous four years could have helped her in the tender.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savova accuses the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions by his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been seeking his extradition from the UK since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls, is behind his criminalization.
A London court last year rejected Savov's appeal against extradition, but the businessman has appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the United Kingdom regarding the acquisition of legal force of the judgment", Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Prague City State Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to his ownership of Mlada Fronta, Savov was a figure in Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and in Maraflex, a Cyprus-based company which profiles itself as an investment fund buying distressed assets.
He also controls the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov has also been linked to the embezzlement of assets from the former Socialist Youth League.
The motorcyclist swerved off the sidewalk and into the park, ending up in a tailspin.
The motorcyclist drew attention to himself by reckless driving on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Ušovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to escape in the direction of the outpost.
"Police officers were pursuing the man through the city with increased caution when he lost control of his motorcycle on a side road behind Mariánské Lázně and crashed into a field", said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Eventually, a rescue helicopter had to arrive and transport the injured motorcyclist to a hospital in Pilsen.
Later, the police discovered that the motorcyclist did not have a driver's license, that the license plates had been stolen, that the serial number had been filed off, and that the tag had been removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test conducted at the scene ruled out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test was positive for methamphetamine", a police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not affect Neymar's record-breaking move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
Financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without large losses.
Barcelona paid the equivalent of 222 million euros just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial terms of Neymar's transfer to France.
Since PSG is funded by a wealthy Qatari family who made their fortune selling energy, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini upon his appointment as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that go into debt in pursuit of new signings end up cheating and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules shifted their focus from the clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending huge sums on players to build a global brand - was suddenly not so profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And although Platini was forced to step down in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is determined to defend the prohibition on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future", Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP, told the Associated Press last week.
According to Article 107 (1) TFEU, 'any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the internal market'.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to €44.4 million per year for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million) - later reduced to €20 million - and ordered to reduce its Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014-15 season, down from 25.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
Therefore, even if a Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the charging of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
A portion of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be reimbursed by the Qatar 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee, according to some reports.
However, PSG and representatives of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the rumor that Neymar would become an ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be watching closely for any attempt to circumvent the rules,
UEFA has not opened an investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the PSG situation, The Associated Press reported.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concludes that the measures under assessment constitute aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club promises a 30% increase in turnover from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of their biggest stars, sought to block Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's ownership by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance on club funding.
"It's a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football in the last 15 years", Wenger said Thursday.
"Once the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
Compliance with financial fair play rules is very difficult because the State may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.'
Change is painful, but we must have faith.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
It's the same scene as Sunday's game against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder got the ball rolling against Red Star, scoring a few goals, but his teammates didn't go for it.
This summer's team, pumped up with new multimillion-pound signings, are out of the European Cups after their opening two games.
Was it hard to do anything after Belgrade's goal?
After a goal was scored, four goals were needed, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least go undefeated, build our confidence, so we'd have something to build on for the next few games.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and up our game.
Why has Sparta failed to get into the game for so long?
The game is very elaborate.
Their combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere. We fired maybe one shot at halftime.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was already much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponents into positions like this more often.
Is the number of lineup changes a problem?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We've only played three competitive games and the lineup keeps changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to fit in.
Is it any encouragement to you that you've already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just parts of the game.
I don't know when I'll be able to play again.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same with an injury.
If you don't have faith, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision. We must be optimistic, or the situation will get worse.
Once again, the fans came in great numbers, but they left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
It was another wonderful visit, just like with Bohemia.
I'm terribly sorry we can't please them with a better performance.
Give them something to come back for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visitors like this when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without trophies at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we've been fighting each other, playing games, so it's not really an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, a businessman is supposed to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of businessman Jiri Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion on a large scale.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights and that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Court judges found the complaint unfounded, according to the court's database.
The SEC is not another court of appeals.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, examine errors of fact or law allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms", the ruling states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Mr Toman was in custody in Argentina, where, according to the Order, he remained at the time of the CFI's decision.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion with a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as chairman of the board of World Service from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage according to the expert exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to sue Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Service failed to include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of making monthly VAT and excise tax payments of at least tens of millions of dollars, she paid taxes in mere hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company did business are related to businessman Radomir Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT fraud in fuel sales.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
"Summer of the Dead" and "Comrade Detective" play on the nostalgic theme
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the glorious 1980s; the sleazy 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter hosted the MTV sketch comedy show "The State"); and, of course, modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd took off for bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a light parody and an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memory.
From a franchise standpoint, it looks like someone's running out of steam.
"First Day of Camp" did surprisingly well - not least because of its absurd humor (such as the tale of a talking can of vegetables voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main joke point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny children - and could not make fun of the previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults, is less emotionally charged, and the satire is sporadic at times, including parodies of 1990s thrillers like "Hand in the Cradle".
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook, roller skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991" in a pile of junk.
Many of the major storylines are repeated.
Good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) instigated by George H. W. Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of a franchise is the many subplots.
Particularly entertaining is watching the eternally young, long-haired Rudd, aka Matt Dillon's character from The Young and the Restless, whose once-respectable Andy character is now an old fart.
The franchise could be kicked off by moments of random madness, like the returning series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I suspect will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the final scene, the entire gang heads to the premiere of "The Dead End".
Amazon's "Comrade Detective", meanwhile, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "Ordinary Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde", and even "GLOW", which pits Eastern and Western wrestling icons against each other.
Written by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers in 1980s Romania who fight for truth and Marxist-Leninist atheism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulica, dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes will make you laugh (such as cops watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors have lent their voices to the series, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer in a Reagan mask - and it looks that way.
Six long episodes is too long and not enough comedy.
In shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" might work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose lobby two fat men devour hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
The clear message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn anything into food and orgies.
The imaginative Romanian creators weren't wrong: we do this to our own culture as well as theirs.
Russian athletes have yet to see their ban lifted by the IAAF.
The International Association of Athletics Federations, at a congress in London, confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The voting for the World Cup, which begins on Friday, was as expected, very close.
A total of 166 delegates voted in favor of extending the ban, with only 21 voting against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia has failed to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as stated before the Congress by the head of the IAAF special investigation team, Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban remain in place.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned, and coaches with tarnished reputations still work in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), which does not meet World Anti-Doping Agency standards, is not yet fully functional.
However, RUSADA can now conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done", said IAAF president Sebastian Coe.
Russia's athletics federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes missed last year's Rio Olympics.
Despite being banned from the upcoming World Cup, 19 Russians will participate who have previously proven to have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for an extended period of time.
However, they will not be able to compete in the national colors at the championship, and if they win, they will not play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, following lacklustre economic growth and weakening inflation, which has dampened speculation of a boom.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" as interest rates remained high - despite the squeeze on family budgets.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted six to two to maintain interest rates at 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the squeeze on household budgets would continue.
The Bank also indicated that growth was expected over the next few years due to Brexit-induced inflation and that property rents were expected to increase more than anticipated in financial markets.
MEPs also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic stimulus package put in place a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Fixed-Term Financing Scheme, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, is due to come into force from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank stated: 'The MPC forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, with pressure on real household incomes and consumption pressures.'
On the subject of rates, the bank said that "tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to calm inflation "to a greater extent" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next from 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The Commission therefore concludes that the restructuring plan will restore the long-term viability of the Bank.
Following the release of the forecasts, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound declined by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after disappointing growth buried hopes of further expansion - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although the bank expects it to pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is of little comfort to households hit by rising inflation and lackluster wage growth.
The report goes on to say that monetary policy 'cannot prevent' a decline in incomes in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise 'significantly' towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also be boosted by strong demand for British goods due to the weak pound, offsetting a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to the shock EU referendum vote, causing the pound to plummet.
The bank estimates that complete unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many had called for a rate hike in line with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and expected inflation to rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess over the 2% target was 'entirely' due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, managing director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase as lenders compete for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks especially good for those who are exiting existing contracts and refinancing - the no-fee options as well as the low rates are gaining popularity".
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September, following the High Court's decision on NHS funding for the drug.
The National Health Service (NHS) in England has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the NHS to about 10,000 patients over a three-year trial period.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's High Court ruling that the NHS had the financial means to pay for PrEP despite statements that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as a "significant intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a "watershed moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
Taking PrEP before sex means that the patient has enough of a particular medicine in their body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants to sign up for testing, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not already controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also register at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international tender.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should complement and take full advantage of the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of trying to halt one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: 'We are witnessing a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if administered correctly and to patients at risk, offers the potential to transform the UK's HIV epidemic.
From September, the NHS will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require a partner to be persuaded, improving the quality of many lives.
We welcome this declaration.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of testing across the country; we must ensure it is available to every patient.
We now have an experimental drug called PrEP, and we're well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of government delays and delays.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug could be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent trials will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV and together stop the spread of HIV in society.'
High-rise living: mezzanine and clever design transform this tiny Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for a flat in Earls Court in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace - it is a prime example of modern design that makes the most of the available space.
"I had previously lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge", said Joanne.
"I was looking for something more reasonably priced.
I came across this flat in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and said yes to him that very day".
Since then, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout -- to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen -- Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I longed for high ceilings, large windows, and lots of light.
Those were my demands", she said.
To do this, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based design and development studio Duck & Shed and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not high enough for two gaps to overlap, so the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine level on which people could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative mind.
"Steel construction is quite complicated", he explained.
"We had to rearrange both rooms so that we could walk upright.
It was not just a question of building a simple platform, but also of bending the steel structure to the right height above and below the ceiling".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and add drama at the same time.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room with old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirrored furniture in gold, silver lines and a retro chandelier by Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor has mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirrored countertop in the kitchen looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance door there are storage compartments with mirrors to store cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of being much larger, is that it can be separated from the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this design is the hinged door.
"We had to solve a technical problem", says Erfan of the reinforced veneer doors.
'The door is fitted with counterweights to enable it to be opened very easily.'
Through clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 54 square feet [16 sq m], a second bedroom, and a better layout.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is living space - or the appreciation of your property", Erfan said.
"Essentially, when a real estate agent enters an apartment, he calculates an estimate based on the square footage".
In this case, it has been possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and you create an emotional bond with the home", Erfan added.
"You don't fall in love with the wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not win your heart".
As it turns out, good design and increased living space can transform an ordinary apartment into something extraordinary.
And like Joanne, you may eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disengaging.
The cultural and political divide between the blue states and the red states is widening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by banning its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, it's not a ban in the strict sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely throughout all 50 states.
The issue is that California has banned its citizens from spending state funds on travel to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's going to stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and considers any expression of disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a conscientious objection law, which states that a psychotherapist who has an ethical problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obligated to provide it, but is obligated to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that exempt religious charities that receive babies for adoption from mothers at birth from having to place those babies for adoption by same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objector laws, California has banned its citizens from traveling to eight states of the Union with its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have their universities pay for trips to scientific symposia in, say, Texas, because those are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in, say, Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund travel for citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and its legislature has passed a bill with a resolution saying that it, too, does not like California's policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but will not impose a travel ban on California because of it.
He's imposing them in retaliation for California's travel ban on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state in the union that imposes a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
He also called on the parliaments of all countries to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass laws on conscientious objection as well as to decide what their money can and cannot be used for.
Second, what is wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork when there are plenty of butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
She also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or cakes that contain alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of a federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but the individual states can make their own internal, domestic policies in non-federal jurisdictions according to the preferences of their people.
Then there is variety, variety, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which all reasonable people should follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever again express moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're the modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know of a situation in American history where states have deliberately done this to each other for political reasons, except in one case.
Even in the days of the black civil rights struggle, when the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South was on the side of segregation, the states didn't sanction each other.
The only exception was in the 1850s, when the political issue was slavery and it was about to become a war between the North and the South.
Of course, none of that is happening now, but the situation is toxic nonetheless.
The cultural and political divide between the blue states, the Democrats, and the red states, the Republicans, is widening, and the United States is mentally disconnecting from itself.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic was fined a lot of money.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for inciting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced his intention to run for president in March next year.
Acting Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said that the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for inciting people to demonstrate through videos posted on the Internet portal YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We will deduct it from the judge's salary later", joked a Kremlin critic on Twitter.
Russia's election commission recently concluded that Navalny is ineligible to run for president because of a previous conviction for embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered an anti-corruption activist, considers the verdict politically motivated.
Two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyashkin, were also fined 300,000 rubles and 25,000 rubles respectively by the court on Thursday.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure in a fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are doing everything they can to prevent Navalny from campaigning.
In February, he was given a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, an appeals court upheld the verdict.
The verdict is so final that Navalny is barred from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Now, more than four decades after their Italian family built an empire, the two brothers are vying for one of the most expensive Victorian properties in the world, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis is staying at Toorak Manor, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over community property and business assets all the way to the High Court.
Paul wanted out of the family business back in 2014, but a bitter dispute continues to play out in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars.
On this site, the family founded Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain of 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for the equivalent of $85 million.
The money was used to buy other properties and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, development land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping centres.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is, in Paul's words, "a significant driving force and dominant figure" in the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court records show that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth.
It was the distribution of property and finances that became a problem for Paul.
"Colin's motion was overwhelmingly in his favor in my eyes", Paul wrote in a court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court held its first session.
The brothers are also now competing for control of the existing business - which Paul claims Colin cut him out of.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
In an earlier affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution to the conflict.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family comes first", he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding in from lawyers including Allan Myers, QC and counsel for both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who had operated dairy bars and delicatessens since the 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They used the money from the mortgage to buy property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first denim business.
Colin said that when he started Westco, "Paul was a little kid, maybe 10 years old, in his last year of college".
Anna De Lutis stated that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would be done peacefully.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation".
Colin has since held back, despite being a former board member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded via text message, stating that due to the fact that the case was before the courts, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a statement to the court, Colin stated that he had tried to accommodate his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation", he said, adding that he "still hopes for a successful solution".
By Friday, all hope was lost.
"Our disputes will soon be settled in court", Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
The teachers are showering the kids.
Public transport drivers are packing water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovec kindergarten in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they go out only in the morning.
The nursery has been renovated, and the newly planted trees do not yet provide much shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog.
In the afternoons, the children remain in their classrooms with the blinds drawn and the curtains drawn.
They're trying to cool the air with an air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard for teachers and cooks, too.
"The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even be open during this period", said Miloslava Makovičková, the director of the kindergarten.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery where she says the temperature hovers around 40 degrees.
We air out after 6:00 in the morning, close the windows, and we have blinds on the south side to protect us.
"But it doesn't help much", she added.
They have better conditions in the forest kindergarten Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees growing on our property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, a table under it, and we do things there", said Barbora Kompanova, the director of the nursery.
Teachers try to take their children into the woods where it's cooler.
The children are given wet caps, and various water games are on the program.
"We have a handheld pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower the children", Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, director of a kindergarten on Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek district, said that teachers try to keep children in the shade and spray them with water.
"We have quite a grown-up garden, so they're under the trees there", she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must wear a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they may choose low-sugar tea or diluted juice, and there are water fountains in the garden.
They also have a daily vegetable salad and a snack of fresh fruit and vegetables, sometimes provided by their parents.
"Maybe today one of the mothers brought a ten-kilogram melon for the children", added Makovičková.
The drivers are given water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
Tram and bus drivers' cabins are mostly air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged by the high temperatures.
There's been some minor damage to the Hostivaari loop.
In view of the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have plenty to drink.
'Cooled drinking water is available at all loops, interchange points and stations,' Řehková said.
In stations and at some interchange points, employees have access to so-called soda fountains, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also given soluble ionic protective drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform, which increases the comfort of the drivers during their daily shifts", the spokeswoman added.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic eliminated 108, twice the long-term daily average.
During the day on Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic soared above 95 degrees Fahrenheit [35°C], firefighters were mainly occupied with fighting fires.
"Natural fires and those related to harvesting operations predominate", said fire department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the change in the weather that evening, with thunderstorms and torrential downpours in many places, did not bring relief to the firemen.
Firefighters responded to 236 storm-related incidents.
This was mainly the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"Most of the interference was in the Central Bohemian Region", Zaoralová continues.
Firefighters were also needed in Stvolínky, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people were evacuated from a children's camp because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also gave Prague's rescue workers something to do.
On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, ambulances responded to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from carp.
Rescuers warn that people should have their water heaters checked.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released during incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and fainting.
If poisoning is suspected, leave the contaminated room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail the president's media diet
Many before him have tried and all have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information about President Trump - including TV news coverage - in hopes of keeping Trump in the loop.
Here's part of a report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with his staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem with the Trump White House that he intends to fix: misinformation getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that he must personally approve all information - whether written or spoken - because the president is better able to make an informed decision".
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors had a hard time controlling Trump and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate to show him that there were plenty of other media outlets talking about him in a positive light that were easier to convince", Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least according to six former campaign organizers - is to make sure Trump regularly watches the media sing his praises".
All right, I got it.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his opinions on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something others don't - that Trump's tweets would be more inflammatory if they weren't monitored.
Tweets that Trump never sent, we'll probably never know about.
If his staff managed to keep him in check at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trump from stirring up controversy on a regular basis.
Part of the problem is that in a White House that consists of competing factions, people regularly try to advance their own agenda by pushing material to Trump -- which may or may not be reliable -- that supports their worldview.
In May, Politico, which has covered the issue from all angles, published a report on the propensity of advisers to present dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say the president has often reacted angrily to negative media reports, especially leaks, and has sought to trace their origins.
The situation came to a head in late February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson was banned from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he didn't back up his claims with any evidence; or that he had made false accusations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "were trying to implement a system to manage and document the information President Trump receives".
Would that work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is pursuing the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness will not go away, and his aides are still vying for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate ditch and return to 'Millionaire's Quarter'
Some of the biggest property owners in England's West Midlands are once again locked in a battle with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to reclaim the land behind their homes.
The tourists parked their 20 caravans in a field off a thriving street in Solihull, dubbed the 'millionaire's quarter.'
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists are returning after being expelled in May, undaunted even by a moat dug at the site by order of the authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the caravan field through an unprotected gap that served as a road.
Angry residents attacked Solihull council for 'not being able to solve the problem.'
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They occupied the site on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of itself for its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
More arrived last night, and more are likely to arrive tonight.'
She added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with the problem, using court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to pay any more taxes until the council has dealt with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident commented: 'It's ridiculous, we just watched the last tourists leave and now they're back.
And this time there are more, and this time they've brought horses.'
A Solihull City Council spokesman said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised residence on a property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the local police to take the necessary legal action to resolve the matter.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is imperative that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or illegal behaviour to the police on 101.
This will give us a complete picture to present in court.'
An MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government task force.
A government special transported the wounded Robert Zitnanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and on board the plane, he was under constant supervision by Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went off without a hitch.
According to TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier this summer.
They say he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transferred to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
An economic analyst, he is married to Jana Žitňanská, a Slovak MEP from the NOVA party.
She declined to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians step up fight against NGO rescue ships with migrants on board
Italy has announced that it will block the arrival of NGO rescue ships carrying migrants from the Mediterranean to Italian shores unless NGOs sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGOs do not sign the new code of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they can continue their operations", Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization declined to comment because of accusations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will always be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in emergency zones at this time", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on any allegations at this time after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation".
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa of Jugend Rettet since October.
Its crew is suspected of having transported immigrants on board that were handed over to them directly by traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the prosecutor's file, allegedly took place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian zeal rather than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
For example, the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has rejected the new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, said a sharp drop in the number of migrants landing in Italy as part of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to strengthen patrols off the Libyan coast and work with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel", he said.
He also revealed plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on an economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
She had silicone and cellulite coming out of her jumpsuit!
Hot summer days make it tempting to wear only the bare essentials to cover the most intimate areas.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone associated with TV Prima was swarming, she wrapped her tiny body in a mini-overall.
And all it took was a few simple gestures and the model showed everyone her boobs, but also her bottom.
He checked her out every time he cut between her thighs, and he pooped so high she had to keep adjusting it.
She certainly didn't need the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy to kill himself
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars followed by five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told the court on Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend".
Carter's been released pending a decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place as the verdict was read with tears in her eyes, hands clasped and eyes to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
However, Carter's attorney said that these were "unfortunate circumstances which she deeply regrets".
Justice Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental illness has no significant bearing on her actions".
The prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "Not a day goes by that I do not grieve the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure an immense pain that we will carry with us forever", the statement said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be an aunt to his children.
"Losing the person I have known since I was born is a pain I will carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in place to punish a person for assisting another's suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned by carbon monoxide.
The case gained national attention after Carter's suicide-promoting text messages were leaked.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care", read text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on a family vacation.
Minutes before she killed herself, she texted him, "You have to do this, Conrad", and, "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz stated that Carter craved attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox, 30, issued a statement in the Los Angeles Times saying, "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison".
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to the backlash
Just a day before Audi's announcement, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said that the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is headquartered - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have heavily promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to meet carbon dioxide emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost to car manufacturers of installing devices to neutralise diesel engine exhaust is increasing, making cars less competitive.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which tried to meet emissions limits by installing software in its cars that reduced emissions during testing but was deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo's former manager, Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian national who is not subject to extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions limits - expanding the charges Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a little girl were killed.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João, in the Costa da Caparica region, about 20 miles [30 km] south of Lisbon.
A witness told SIC Noticias that before landing, the plane flew directly over people sunbathing on the beach.
Some people on the beach reportedly ran into the sea to escape the danger.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"They were hit by a plane and died on the spot", said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationalities are unknown at this time.
There were two people on board the plane, both survived the crash and were taken in for questioning by police.
D11, or how not to build a freeway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even feasible?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it was started in 1978.
Even though it's incomplete, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built on, even if it has a building permit.
What's this? What's this?
Yes, the D11 castle highway.
The Children of the Earth movement recently halted construction on another section for at least several months.
We easterners are cutting up the highway like sliced salami.
We'll take a break, and then we'll see if and when we get another one.
We're not asking for a miracle.
We just want to shorten the journey time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland out of the villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks pass right through the towns of Jaroměř and Náchod, which are hard to avoid.
But so far, the last stretch of our dream highway opened in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a peep since.
Thus, when construction recently began on the remaining two and a half miles [4 km] of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové and archaeological exploration began on other sections to Jaroměř, with construction scheduled to begin at the end of this year, you could hear loud cork pops in eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one believed it anymore.
Turned out last week there wasn't going to be one this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno has been dissolved.
The Children of Earth are repeating their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decisions in their entirety.
In decomposition, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the County Council, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Administration.
Meanwhile, we're getting off the D11 near a village called Pohřebačka.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and we're going to pull over to the side of the road, and we're going to get in line.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the republic.
Scary, constantly congested road to Benešov, motorway D1 or D8.
Everybody's got a needle and thread.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway system virtually unfinishable under the present system?
Read it in the new Reflection.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
Drought and insect pests are decimating the lavender, causing consternation among researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "Lavender cultivation in Provence is threatened because in the last few years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which means less rain in spring and autumn.
It affects the life span of the lavender.
Cicadas and grasshoppers, which thrive in dry climates, also play a role".
There's too much at stake.
Lavender is a tourist attraction, and its oil is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of tall, beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped, and often weak plants grow.
Obviously, the amount of oil extracted from these lavenders is less".
Potential solutions include more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more drought-tolerant varieties.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meets regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the ongoing unrest in the Sinaloa region involving organized crime, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
Today, however, in the wake of recent events, they meet mainly for their own safety.
They learn the importance of changing their habits.
Two respected journalists discuss what would be safer: taking your children with you to an office that was hit by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on a blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to name every word - no evidence needed, just imagination and intuition.
There are many to choose from - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists suspected of accepting money from governments or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up their criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies are piling up across the country; journalists are on the rise: at least 25 have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his many books on the violence associated with the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, though his presence is pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the word "Justice" in the middle finger hangs on the building's facade; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - in their 30s, wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, so far it has prosecuted two suspects, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, making it very rare for the killers of journalists to be brought to justice.
Riodoca journalists insist on reporting on the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings", he adds.
"Until we have more information, no one can be trusted".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoca headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as Twelfth River.
The gunmen then got into his car and crashed it near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Word seems to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In the case of Valdez, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill the void.
Several people are killed each day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with ornate two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with valuable ports and important drug routes into the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoca, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival drug cartels waging war on Joaquin Guzman's sons.
The truce may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing other papers that had printed the same story.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight by Mexican criminals against journalists.
He'd managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that would never change.
He was practically a veteran at Northeastern when, in 2003, he decided to sell his shares for $50 and start Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the drug trade", said Bojorquez.
In time, Riodoca gained a reputation for courageous and truthful reporting, and the newspaper began to prosper.
Journalists were happy to investigate troubling topics and publish uncensored - readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoca won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
"I feared for my life", he said as he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "way of life", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You must assume the role of a journalist - or play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
Rio Doce employees will miss Valdez, a man known for his wit and unfiltered language, a good friend who loved to give advice and hugs, a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the bar El Guayabo opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask, did this routine cause his death?
His death also caused them to question their own assumptions - how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their kids, their clean stores, their secret landing sites".
"These things were forbidden", Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's not right here, hands off.
The problem, said RioDoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then there was the Javier thing".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, he says, as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is always changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the meeting room of Riodoca's staff, following the discovery a few days ago of spyware purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen find relief from the 100-degree-Fahrenheit [40°C] heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, located in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacán.
Journalists joke that these officers may be among the 50 percent of law-enforcement officials that the government says are corrupt.
It's been several months since journalists have ventured into the mountainous regions that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three major stories on this week's agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They're also looking into suspicious government spending in the state governor's hometown.
There have also recently been several kidnappings at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the Attorney General's office.
Officially, no one has announced the identity of the kidnappers or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were cautious about reporting what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination of drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant in question was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for most of the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents that had taken place at the restaurant, including the incident in which one of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped an army task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about it in Valdez's column, the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would definitely solve the case", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informers have turned their backs on us".
Valdez's office was turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signs and went to demonstrate in front of the Attorney General's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western state of Michoacan.
Only a burned body was found, but authorities say DNA analysis has identified it as Adamo's.
Journalist activity is escalating across the country, with many organizing protests and scribbling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings.
Newspaper editor Bojorquez is in Washington today seeking international support for justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused authorities of targeting journalists and killing them for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she requested a transfer to another department, fearing that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "beaten down" by organized crime, corrupt officials and public indifference.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists are killed not only by drug cartels, but also by politicians and security forces who collaborate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed police and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to silence you", Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías six years ago on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages".
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close, such as El Norte, based in the northern border state of Chihuahua, in response to the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page article entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's not an easy decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is overcoming the feeling of being constantly hounded.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and keep their jobs, every day is a risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs terrifies him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist", he said.
It's midnight on a Friday, and the employees of Riodoce are sitting on the sidewalk outside their office - the latest issue has gone to press - sipping a beer when their phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people have been killed in a shootout between gang members and police near the beach resort of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as promised by the many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate.
Journalists are posting the news on the Riodoce website from their mobile phones.
Not a day goes by and the headline changes again.
The sound of police sirens indicates another shooting.
Bojorquez takes a quick look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is the eloquent slogan for all Sinaloa - all the employees of the Riodoca follow in his footsteps.
"How could we even think of leaving", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now revealed the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - dubbed the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' by experts - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were so well preserved that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and said that the dinosaur had a 'troubled past.'
According to an article in the journal Current Biology, it is "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best-preserved dinosaur genera in the world".
The fossil is a new species of Nodosauridae, a dinosaur that lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfect state of preservation shocked researchers, who described it as "remarkable indeed".
According to National Geographic, the platypus is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to unearth the animal from a massive 2,000-pound lump of earth.
With the work completed, the dinosaur is ready for unveiling.
'You only have to squint a little to believe it is asleep,' said Caleb Brown, curator and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
'It will surely go down in the annals of history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, researchers have determined that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect itself from predators and used a camouflage system used by many animals today.
Experts say this allowed it to better blend in with its surroundings and avoid predators, and the camouflage system suggests it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110-million-year-old Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May, and it is currently on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who and his team spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly unearthing the fossil.
Thanks to the fossil's remarkable state of preservation, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shapes of scales and armor all over the body.
They discovered a method of camouflage commonly used by modern animals for defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its underside.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because the Boreal's size far exceeds that of modern animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was such a prolific predator that evolution favored camouflage over confrontation for survival.
Many modern animals with camouflage - such as deer, zebras and armadillos - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that Nosodurus had to literally fight for its survival.
'The sale of a huge and heavily armoured dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by Cretaceous predators,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was likely a reddish-brown color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for other clues about its life, including preserved stomach contents to track down its last meal.
They believe that after the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
At that time, Alberta had a climate similar to that of present-day Florida, and rivers and oceans ran much farther inland than they do today.
'What's really remarkable about this nodosaur is that it's completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and it's also preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size,' Brown said.
'For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just blink a little and it seems to be asleep.'
In the Cretaceous period, giant theropods walked the Earth, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of its equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11-metre-long monster weighing over six tonnes.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt's body was washed out to sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, complete from snout to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two 18-inch spikes protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it out to sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, 'finding one preserved in this way is like winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking the find seems.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with the toes pointing upward.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9th, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaking all over.
The day after arriving in New York City, a St. Louis native sat on the bed of her Airbnb room, scrolling through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a post by a high school student.
"An 18-year-old has just been shot dead by police and his body is still lying in the street", it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post for her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Twitter user @TheePharoah was constantly retweeting her wall posts.
The St. Louis rapper was tweeting about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying helpless in the street, unclaimed for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone away to return to it the night she saw tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and was holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters with a leash in his hand and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, she said, another police officer was holding a gun and pointing it at the crowd, shouting, "I will kill you all... animals".
"This is not normal", Ferrell said to herself.
"This is not the type of murder that we are used to and that we can call normal.
I got goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried".
She immediately booked a return flight home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to drive to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is chronicled in a new documentary, "Whose Streets?"
It's a story of survival and protest, love and defiance, strength and resilience told from the perspective of the people living in the community who took to the streets and demanded answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell struck up a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral sweater and the same floral headdress - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "the black experience".
"Remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls the conversation.
"Right now, we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old kid, and that's not right".
"There was no way I wasn't going to take her with me", Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the culmination... of events that have occurred in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow into it.
She needed to grow not only in activism and organizing, but she also needed to learn the difference between the different layers of black experience and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Even though I'm able to provide her with an environment where she doesn't experience racism firsthand, she's no different than any other black female child.
I feel that to shield her from this experience would only hurt her".
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road across from the police station, which became a base for activists awaiting word from Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
There, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared meals for others.
Together, they packed food and helped distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new kind of activism was slowly emerging.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9", Ferrell said, adding that while in college at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and worked to bring health care and food to black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It was natural".
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, who would later co-direct the documentary, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell wondered, "Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story to use?"
And that kind of skepticism trickled down to the community through a lot of people, often white people, who wanted to capitalize on the pain and the determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often left out, and we wanted to change that".
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, an acclaimed local artist who works with death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also interested Ferrell, along with six other locals who were followed by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our testimony", Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people would be represented - because that's how I would be represented".
While the documentary was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community together", Folayan said - she turned out to be the most open to participating.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how he fell in love with his wife.
"I felt naked", said Ferrell with a smile on her face as she recalled the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I realized that in order to do this work and humanize black people, I had to open up".
Additionally, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the larger Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - which created the #BlackLivesMatter social media campaign in response to the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin - call themselves queer.
"Black queer women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the preservation of the movement", Ferrell said, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the brunt of these events".
Folayan agrees, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of queer black women".
However, he insists that "this is not just an affirmative action issue" and that Ferrell is not the subject of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy", she said.
"it's no accident that she's on the front lines, "because living at these crossroads as a black queer woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy even in front of the screen".
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV cameras have cleared their positions, but the difficult racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking a highway during a protest.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as "messy".
And yet, she's relentless in her pursuit, which she's been committed to since she hit the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
The only thing we have to lose is our chains".
A field was burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters responded, including a helicopter.
Near Český Brod in Kolínsko, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a 15-hectare field has been burning since 2 p.m.
The fire was extinguished by 3:15 p.m., and firefighters declared a three-alarm fire out of four.
According to firefighters' spokesman Ladislav Holomchik, a helicopter also helped extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the blaze at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the combine's engine compartment.
A helicopter also helped by dropping six drops of water.
"The scene has been handed over to the owner and will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters until 8:00 tomorrow", Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: an artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
At the center of a room at the Friedman Gallery in New York City are several faces of different skin tones - white, black, and brown - suspended from the ceiling by wires, each seeming to pop out of the other's eye.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the unauthorized publication of classified cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before he left office.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to depict what a person with that genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if not intellectual, commentary on the malleability of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of those interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning and spoke of identifying as a woman from a young age, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud, and theft.
All photographs of her were withheld by prison officials, except for one poor-quality black-and-white photograph of a visibly distressed Manning in the driver's seat wearing the platinum blonde wig now associated with her.
In 2015, positive reactions to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 project Stranger Visions were still being heard.
For this project, Dewey-Hagborg used a variety of forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of what these people might look like.
And that's when she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they wanted to do a portrait", Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, no visitors or photographs were allowed, so they approached Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in a DNA profile.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, days after the comic was published, President Obama called for Manning's release, a welcome change after several excruciating years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war on whistleblowers and transgender troops while trying to find new ways to use his tweets to incite hatred in areas he is supposed to support.
When asked about this peculiar timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything happens for a reason".
Under a statement by the artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning's huge signature (the "i" in her last name is crossed out with a heart) calls for an end to "self-inflicted factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G, and A written in pencil.
By arranging 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope people take away from this that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and can be interpreted in different ways", said Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them".
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the aforementioned graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging King Kong style from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win", it says.
"Never allow yourself to be silenced".
"It's a direct transcription of one of the letters", said the Philadelphia artist.
"I get goose bumps just thinking about it".
Manning has not yet visited the exhibit in person -- as was predicted in the comic -- but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic likenesses, lined up like a crowd of protesters.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibit, including a nearly five-foot-tall statue of Manning with her genetic haplogroups written in pencil.
"In the past they have been placed on walls, but this time I wanted them to have a crowd feel", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement taking on Chelsea's form and liberating her".
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee wanted for the murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of murdering a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police say.
Warrants were issued Monday for the first-degree murder of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleo, according to Cook County court records.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the deceased's body was found on July 27.
Officers responding to a 911 call at the Grand Plaza Apartments found the victim in one of the apartments with multiple stab wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide.
Lathem has served as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president for public affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university campus.
"The matter is now under investigation by the appropriate authorities and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them", stated Cubbage.
Warren is the chief financial officer at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been contacted by British police and are ready to assist American police as well".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the incident and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public affairs for the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional, and national authorities are assisting police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to events that were about to take place in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as extremely violent.
Guglielmi said it's unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim", Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to establish a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence".
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and re-establish the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
'At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In light of this, WADA's plan has been updated", Mutko said Thursday.
The Vice-Chairman commented on the second part of WADA's Code Compliance Plan - which describes the criteria for RUSADA's reinstatement - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the codex contains nothing that should concern Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly.'
However, one of the criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of WADA's investigation, led by Richard McLaren, into alleged government sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All precautions have been taken.
But there were no government programs in our country, so we cannot admit to something that never existed".
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservations", concluded Smirnov.
WADA suspected RUSADA of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately prior to the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and harmonisation of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKADA) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organisation's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "on the right track" for reinstatement.
Police charged three people, one of them a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with starting Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in Frýdecko-Místek.
One of the accused is a minor, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of endangering public safety.
Moravian-Silesian police chief Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
He said it was a premeditated crime.
"It's a very fresh case and the police are currently working on the motive", Kužel said.
He stated that the police would discuss the possibility of taking the accused into custody.
Further information cannot be disclosed, according to the Director.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and the state prosecutor are working on the case", Kužel said.
The wooden church of Corpus Christi in Guti dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Preliminary damage estimates are in the tens of millions of dollars, but the historic loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, there was talk of rebuilding the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the Ministry of Culture and the city are ready to share additional costs, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution from the owner of the monument, the local parish, is expected.
A similar 16th-century wooden church in Ostrava-Hrabova was also destroyed by fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a faulty electrical system.
In its place, an exact duplicate was created.
The state counts on its citizens to defend the state.
It'll enhance their training.
Financial support for associations useful in the defence of the State, voluntary shooting training or a team of training instructors are envisaged by the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the State.
The Ministry of Defense, which was commissioned by the government, hopes that it will increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is according to a draft prepared by the ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the military.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the draft is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of military service and on a voluntary basis.
The State would, for example, provide financial or material support to amateur radio clubs, shooting clubs and dog clubs and enable their members to improve their skills.
In return, he would receive information about the people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis and about their skills or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties with training or education.
It is also planned to hold talks with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
One option is to create a new office to manage and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that people's participation should be voluntary and the state should use their abilities only after a state of emergency is declared.
'The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously clear boundaries between different types of threats', states the intention, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that the focus should therefore be on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not only military ones.
"The basic aim of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to hinder the performance of tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic", the plan states.
If the bill passes, it's going to be a huge financial burden.
According to the Ministry, the amount will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the Office foresees financial support of up to CZK 100 million for projects to prepare citizens for national defence.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, it could cost about DKK 60 million a year to operate.
The rest of the money would go to salaries or building an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded to employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow the shooters included in the system to keep certain weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups that will keep your company from becoming another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she couldn't find an appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And although she promised anonymity for the inquiry, some employees have expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity", said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New HR start-ups are constantly emerging to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By building and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee engagement, startups allow companies to conduct quick polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer complete employee anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact the CEO directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that after three years of using Glint, she had become more aware of what her employees were thinking and feeling.
In addition to quick surveys and polls of specific teams, Glint offers a company heat map and a cursory view of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a view of managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on a fix.
Companies are waking up to the need to be mindful of workplace culture - in case they become the next Uber - which has been rocked by scandals after a former employee posted a blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a website dedicated to technological and financial advancements, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small spike in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently took Uber under his wing.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect real-time intelligence, and display heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
"The court of public opinion has empowered regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreating its employees or engaging in unethical behavior - and if regulators don't step in - it can face costly consequences from customer boycotts, employee burnout, or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to increase employee awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to look up the company's phone number or e-mail address, file a formal complaint, and hope for a favorable resolution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was previously no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it is able to quickly detect and resolve problems that previously never reached managers sitting in offices miles away from actually dealing with complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's getting closer to a holistic, holistic view of the employee experience", said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's group overseeing risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from employee lawsuits".
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following the collapse of Enron over employee ethics abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media lit up the whole thing" that companies began to realize they couldn't just keep their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people used technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith", Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which the companies pay recurring fees.
It's a business model and an opportunity endorsed by the venture capitalists who backed both startups.
Convercent raised a total of $10 million in its February campaign from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and ultimately took home $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million over the course of the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today's workers expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects aren't the main advantages.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a company that is pursuing a positive mission.
"If people are happy at work, feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they contribute to the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies do well, and companies do well when their employees are happy.
And when an analytics tool comes to market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's not surprising that there are a lot of investors who will support that effort.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company doesn't take the necessary steps.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if change does not come quickly - or even at all - it can lead to employee frustration and disengagement.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, director of consultancy Kotter International, who has seen many companies rely too much on data alone.
"Because when you don't follow through, employees start to wonder, 'Did they hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, can solve the problem in one day with Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and poor communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and begin communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining vital insight into its workforce and hopes to achieve long-term high employment in an industry known for frequent layoffs.
"If you don't strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won't trust you", Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you start losing customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt".
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year so far in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonín.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But unlike Tuesday, not many temperature records were broken on Thursday.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equalled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term monitoring stations recorded the record.
For example, in Watchtower, today's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice on Břeclavsk today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice on Brno current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the Watchtower, were from 2013.
High temperatures today occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the hottest places were Dyjakovice in Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclav region, where the mercury reached 37.8 degrees Celsius, but the record was not broken.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, today's high temperatures were only about 72 degrees Fahrenheit [22°C], according to the Czech Meteorological Institute website.
"Temperatures did not begin to rise there until later this afternoon", the weather service reported.
According to the Czech Meteorological Office, the current heat wave in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've got a bit of a situation here.
It's not enough for billionaires to have the same one vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as brazen as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta, Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues from abroad, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors the Robejškov Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and the king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta has acquired the Party of Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andrej Babiš's project was inadvertently named by Kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter unto itself.
The Mayors recently caught their own billionaire.
His name is Dalibor Dedek, owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
In his own words, he entered politics to do good.
Grandpa didn't make much of an entrance in his mayor's uniform.
"I've never had small dreams", he said at a press conference.
That means my goal is for the YES movement, for the Mayor's movement, to get 20 percent of the vote.
Some of them grinned.
My grandfather's remark is rather typical.
Billionaire Dalibor Dedek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for mayor, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Grandfather supported Babis in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned orator and does not have the smooth rhetoric of political snakes", he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he's definitely not in politics because he wants to better himself.
Grandma will always be a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his controlled world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new addition, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wants the mayors to learn to imagine working with Babis.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his opinions and stands his ground no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate that Babis is sending someone this clumsy to the Mayor's office to build his B.
Others may wonder if the head of Jablotron, for example, has broken with the head of Agrofert in a business dispute and is looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearances weren't just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send 10 million crowns to the Mayors' campaign.
And he says if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, such a statement would have been hard to dismiss.
After all, convicted crook Zdenek Bakala spent millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárty, TOP 09 and the Citizens' Democrats have together raised almost 30 million.
But it's a different time now.
The law prohibits anyone from giving a political party more than $3 million.
If Grandpa's going into politics, he should at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then you wouldn't have to wonder why politics has such a bad reputation in this country.
Grandpa crowned his first days in politics by proposing tax breaks for families with college-educated children.
We get about 50,000 people a month with college degrees.
The ones with less than 20 years of basic.
A man with fifty thousand is rich by local standards.
The one with the 20 bucks.
In Dedek's vision of society, the poor pay their fair share of taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state with little input from them.
The rich simply need to be helped out of poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions and Granny can rub her hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Santa Claus, can confirm that billionaires aren't nice people.
Then there's the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to play by them.
Those who do not consider the members of their party or the citizens of the state as their employees or the country as their property.
Finally, there are those who want a prosperous country in which all can live well, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The condo complex must have dropped $234 million.
Selling real estate isn't always easy.
And a lot of the time, it's not helped by the 11 bedrooms, the gorgeous ocean views, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
With the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price has dropped by a staggering £8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure for the property says, "Greetings, Donald J. Trump".
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the president of the United States didn't justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump has had to reduce the price of his Caribbean mansion by a staggering £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
So even after the discount, a residential complex costs about as much as 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The stunning five-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym, and other facilities.
It consists of several buildings.
There's a swimming pool and a tennis court on the property.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the property.
The terrace has a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price reflects the fact that the connection to the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the island's real estate prices.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
There's speculation that he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, it's in second place.
The property next door was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end the two-a-day practice schedule.
It's nearing 11:00 a.m., and the UCLA football team is huddled on the sideline of the school's new stadium.
Some of them take off their jerseys to reveal sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team, these few minutes of idleness are like a lunch break.
The players enrolled in the summer semester will go to their rooms after a three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting to be held the following morning at 6:30.
"The next three days are going to be really tough for these guys", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday was changed to Tuesday.
By eliminating two practices in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for the players - paradoxically making the training days even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That's why UCLA's first three practices are scheduled for 7:15 to accommodate the already overcrowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in Mora's six seasons as Westwood's head coach, the Bruins' training camp will begin a week earlier than last year and practices will be limited during the summer, including a decision to reduce the number of practices from two to one per day.
Eighteen practices are scheduled through August 20, after which formal preparations begin for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora let it be known that he supports the NCAA's decision, despite it adding yet another item to the players' already packed schedule.
"For three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them", Mora said.
"But no one's giving up, they're all trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down".
UCLA will be closed after training camp, which won't be easy considering the clean lines of the surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot to the luxurious Luskin Center Hotel, which the players have occupied after removing the safety net behind the goal post.
The Bruins are expected to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by the security service", Mora added.
"Security is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
There's a good market for this kind of material.
Fortunately, the hotel will have security, as well as parking lot 8.
We'll make the most of our resources.
I believe that everything will turn out well.
It's all planned".
Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to curb fake news
Facebook will send more potentially false articles for third-party review and display the findings below the original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news", the largest social network said Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company says it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results below original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unverified reports influenced last year's US presidential election.
The issue has sparked political debate in Europe, with French voters inundated with fake news about May's presidential election and Germany planning to fine a social media network ahead of September's election if it does not quickly remove angry posts.
In a further statement issued in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was preparing to launch a test of a new fake news check feature in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing third-party verified news, people are asking for more content to make informed choices about what to share", Sara Su, Facebook's news product manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce fake news.
Making a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle was recently featured in a Squeeze music video, and Margaret Thatcher took refuge there during the 1970's and 1980's.
But from his cozy perch on the River Bewl in Kent, England, Scotney has witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history that inspired curly-haired Yorkshire native Jamie Rhodes - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the handwriting of a man who has been dead for 300 years fascinates me", says Rhodes with a straight face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection".
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who resided at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, with each story illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a thumbprint on a letter written in the 1970s by a double agent working for the Jacobites", he said.
"It's his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke because in those days you had to light a candle to read them.
When I smell that letter now, 300 years later, it's like I've gone back in time.
How I love the archives!"
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to stay at the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities, such as a hyena head on the wall and bottles that had been thrown into the moat for centuries.
He walked the grounds, examining the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
He was "drinking whiskey and writing" at night.
Scotney's private history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived on the scene ten years later, the staff were just beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described as "the aristocrats of many centuries waving their hands and saying, 'Take it to the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, property maps: "You may think a land dispute is boring", Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.
Knock it off, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a castle revolt in 1380 in a book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex", said Rhodes.
"The English rebellion actually began in this area, "and it occurred to me that rebellion was a good place to start.
Maybe there's a connection after all".
Other stories are firmly tied to the castle's history - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly faked his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which wasn't discovered until years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male generation - back then men were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Generations of Darrells have dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - handsome gentlemen, I imagine, who liked to mess with the heiresses' heads".
With his stay at the castle over, Rhodes is looking for more adventure.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that has been swallowed up by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left", he said.
"I was like, 'Now I've got to get the hell back to real life.'"
Washington is changing the terms of the green card.
The media reported President Donald Trump's remarks about the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change the way green cards are issued.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 a year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are being proposed by Republicans and the president.
A bill will soon be introduced in Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the rules for issuing green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who have ample financial resources and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country", Trump was quoted as saying by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be wary
Just when it seemed like 2017 couldn't get any weirder, a report about the technological development of sex robots appears on the Internet.
Yes, you did.
Sex robots are really popular right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, and the shape of its fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but sales are up, and we have to be prepared to see them more and more", Sharkey said when the report was released.
Modern sex toys are changing from inflatable men to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - not to mention artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "customize" the robot in his own image - from the color of his eyes and the shape of his nipples to the shape and color of his fingernails.
Of great concern, however, is the fact that many robots have a "personality" that would put even a Stepford wife to shame.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can give his surrogate a variety of personality traits, including shyness.
And then there's True Companion's sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah", who has a shy nature, and "Wild Wendy", who has an "adventurous" nature.
"Roxxy Gold's personality is set to match your personality as closely as possible", says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and you like what she likes.
It's even moody, like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or "in the mood".
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons, not the least of which is the substitution for real human relationships.
The company True Companion on its website likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" the site says.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex toy.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and more deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from an ideal or gender equality toward a desire for compelling sex with optional extras.
Of course, most men won't buy a robot wife, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of mainstream interest.
But this fringe interest can become a mirror set to the current modern age.
And most people aren't weird or violent unless the free market gives them an excuse.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women around the world are fighting for their rights and we have a president in the White House who is often very derogatory to women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - the hanged bodies and the gouged eyes - but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale book proposal is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots are supposed to be as close to real women as possible (though with the proportions of a porn actress).
Their makers design them to be pleasant to the touch and to look like a real woman at first glance.
But when it comes to their "personality", a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no jobs, no history, nothing to encourage their independence or compromise their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
The language of the 21st century: service.
NBA star on the green.
Curry's fighting for the cut in California.
Basketball star Stephen Curry, despite a botched first tee shot in his first start, has not lost his way among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player has shot a 74 in the first round of the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic in Hayward, California and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who led the Warriors to their second NBA title this season, got off to a nervous start, hitting his first shot into the cup holder of a golf cart parked on the fairway.
Even then, he wasn't as accurate between the holes as he was under the basket, but he still left a dozen professionals behind with four strokes over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the umpire right after the first pitch, but then it settled down a little bit", Curry said, adding that he was very nervous.
It was very nerve-racking, hitting the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I hoped it would be.
"If you told me I'd get a 74 in the first round, I'd take it in a heartbeat", he added.
If Curry makes the cut, which is likely to be two strokes under par, he'll become the first player from another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I'm free of stage fright, hopefully I can", said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed amateur and professional events.
It's his first PGA Tour event at Hayward.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
On the other hand, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
A sure sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that are dividing American voters and, on a micro scale, tearing families apart.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, American newspapers swarmed with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to give out.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to bring families together.
I bring this up because I had a visit in New York this week from my cousin, a poet and left-wing groupie who lives in Chicago and who for a long time in our family paid the price for being a Republican simpleton.
She reminded me that coming together in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom she's bickered about politics for years - is on the same page.
It's a good thing at the family dinner table, but it strikes me that in the larger context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his antics may one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans who, in defiance of his standards, suddenly become the embodiment of what can only be called rationality.
In these today, with a nostalgic heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - dog on top of car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax returns) - both of which seem like very minor infractions compared to Trump.
With Trump gone, all the next Republican nominee has to do is be at least normal, which would be a huge improvement.
Taking advantage of my cousin's visit, we took the kids to Central Park for the largest carousel run by the New York City Department of Parks -- you can't do better with your three dollars, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals twirling and looking over their shoulders in horror - an utterly grim sight, and the jingling music is eerily reminiscent of public transportation.
Many clichés soon get old: the view from high buildings, the panorama stares rather than breathes, and the reality of the city doesn't match your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still can't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't actually Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub - but a London Underground station.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park is a remarkably magical experience, so much so that two two-year-olds as well as two mature women can enjoy it.
If I could rate the merry-go-round, I'd give it maximum points, but fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience this week at the grocery store when I was asked to rate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when paying with my credit card.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, except I can throw in a 15% tip for something I buy over the counter.
Not only does this slow down an otherwise brisk sale, but the waitress is forced to ingratiate herself with shoppers when she doesn't need to.
The woman at the store smiled and apologized when I reluctantly gave my credit-card presentation a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius has been rushed from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts on his wrists, which the prison said were self-inflicted after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing his original manslaughter conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day, 2013, with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a bathroom cabinet in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to South Africa's highest court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda has given birth to a cub after mating in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the panda gene pool in captivity.
Zhang Zhizhong, a worker at the center, told Xinhua News Agency that breeding pandas poses a great risk.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas remained in captivity.
There are only 2,000 left in the wild.
Efforts to breed captive pandas with wild ones are thus a first step in breeding pandas to help protect the species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-chao was released into the reserve at the start of the panda's mating season on March 11.
With a tracking device around her neck, scientists could watch her every move.
Twelve days later, Chao-chao met her match.
The intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
This too can be considered a minor miracle, for male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers in the animal kingdom.
Males are quite bad at judging when a female is ready, and they are often confused and unsure of what to do.
The calf was born healthy and, despite Chao-chao's extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams at birth.
The average newborn panda weighs 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on Greek territory for illegal camping, bTV reported.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained in the early hours of 1 August by Sithonia police.
All were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free camping and impose heavy fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not permitted.
The inspections will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klara Spilková is tied for 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
At Kingsbarns, Scotland, she went one stroke under par for three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech hopes to make her first cut at a major.
Entering the $3.25 million event, American star Michelle Wie won the first round by a course-record 64 strokes, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch food safety authority NVWA has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it says means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority emphasised that only a limited number of egg types recognisable by specific numbers pose a risk.
According to the German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also closed farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland where the insecticide problem marks have appeared on the market.
According to the Veterinary Administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last seen in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance used in products to control fleas, lice and ticks.
However, it must not be used in animals from which meat is produced for human consumption.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation mildly toxic.
In high doses, it causes nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for a job.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day", said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
Depends if he gets a gig before the new year starts.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia like?
If I had to rate it like school, I'd say three.
I didn't catch much my first year. I had an experienced goalie.
I was studying.
Second year, I started catching.
By season three, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, and I took turns with him.
Last year I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But we only scored, like, five points in the first ten games, so the coaches started filming it.
By the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Riga?
It's wonderful.
It's a small Prague.
This is a beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm going to miss him.
I made a friend there.
It's our third year together, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How tough is the KHL for goalies?
The top ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or the Slavs who have to change their style of play against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to make up for it.
That means more playing back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem with the width of the court.
The difference is the Russians want to play for nothing.
They shoot less, and even when they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you have any trouble traveling across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually set up so that you play, like, four games on the road and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
Like the national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, it's the national sport along with basketball.
They're all fans.
Even though it wasn't going well, a lot of people came.
Did Dinamo's time in the KHL help Latvia reach the quarterfinals of this year's World Championship?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And at the same time, their scores at the World Championships started to go up.
At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Canada, losing 2-1.
It was an incredible result for them.
The KHL has taken them to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts has established himself in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign the contract.
Why do so many of them come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still single?
By the beginning of February, I knew I couldn't continue in Riga.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have the budget for a goalie, we didn't make the deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they ended up going with someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'm waiting for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was me four years ago when I walked out of here not knowing what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I'm home after some time.
I picked up something in the KHL, so I'm taking it in a different direction.
It's just a question of when and where.
How realistic is it that you'll start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens next month, where things go.
Now all I can do is wait to hear what the agent has to say.
Would you prefer a contest?
This past season hasn't been one of choices.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government's fling at Let continues.
In January of this year, I wrote about the camp at Lety u Orlíku in the article Care of a Good Housekeeper?
The essence of the problem remains the same, so allow me to recall the key passages of the article.
There's been talk of a camp at Lety for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look for example at the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, in the introduction to the historical overview, they learn that the camp was located two kilometers east of the village of Leta, that from August 8, 1940 it served as a labor camp, from January 1, 1942 it was a collection camp, and from August 2, 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first Lodz prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 persons were transported to the extermination camp in the largest transport.
There were 420 of them.
It's a very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings caused by human beings and a perverted ideology.
There is no question about the need for constant reminders of these events.
Nor is there any question that the commemoration should take place at a memorial in the place of their suffering.
The problem lies elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s, a pigsty was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy out and demolish the pig farm, but this has not yet happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much, very briefly, for the facts of the camp's postwar fate.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig and decided that an expert report would be prepared to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pigs.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some figures, but I would probably spoil those plans if I went public with them".
We'll see what the expert opinion brings up.
Some unofficial estimates put the cost in the hundreds of millions, others in the billions.
Either way, it's not going to be a cheap affair.
Yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial that the government invested nearly ten million crowns in renovating in 2010.
Even if the UN Human Rights Committee were to finance the whole transaction, which they're clearly not, I still think it would be a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, is located near the site of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can pay his respects to those who suffered and were murdered.
I don't see any reason to change that!
Let's leave it as it is and maintain the place of worship with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including taxpayers' money, should be handled with the care of a good steward by the person in charge, in this case the government of the Czech Republic.
At least as good as your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
Nevertheless, in the light of the above, I regard the slogan of the leader of the YES movement as nothing more than an empty election manifesto.
In May of this year, I went to see the place for myself.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of the log cabins.
In one exhibit, an integrated toilet with running water in the other.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating and overlooking its own place of worship, which is made of stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes befitting the importance of this place, as it should be.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the exposed foundations could be conserved and made at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
The Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could make an effort in this direction.
If he succeeds in getting the government to buy pork with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as culture minister.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare to your digestive system.
However, a new study suggests just the opposite: A diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps produce immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, who led the study, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes in food are eliminated.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tip on the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the study, researchers found immune cells that promote tolerance in the stomachs of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to build cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have found a link between one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had".
He also suggested that if the same turns out to be true in humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory gut environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, while studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice kept in isolation lacked them.
She deduced that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally inhabit the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the other group of mice lacked.
Mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome -- so they didn't develop these kinds of immune cells -- were given L. reuteri bacteria, and they developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred a small amount of liquid - free of the bacteria - to immature immune cells that had been kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After the active ingredient was removed from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us carry L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the intestinal lining.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population.'
Jose Mourinho considers the signing of Nemanja Matic and his move to Manchester United to be 'brilliant'
Manchester United have a "genius" in Nemanja Matic - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Matic, signed for £40 million, made his debut in the 2-1 win in Dublin - the final pre-season game before United's UEFA Super Cup clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his midfield role alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, due to missing the team's pre-season tour of Asia, Matic was out of form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - he thinks football", Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible".
Like Matic, new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku have also played their first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to build his squad for next season.
An independent source reported this week that Mourinho is still keen to sign three more players, but insists the club have done a "fantastic job" in bringing in three of their four most important players.
"Thank you to the club for helping me sign three of the four players", he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me".
The challenge of a lifetime for the king of chicken nuggets, Lady Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to emerge thanks to a new TV show called Prima Zdenka's Academy.
Grushka immediately smelled an opportunity.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to apply to your cooking academy, because, honestly, I think I can learn a lot from you", he challenged him in a video on a social network.
And since the two of them have been at it for years, Lada didn't forget to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you how to sweat diet chicken, pickles, or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is popular", snapped Hruska.
He's really serious about being in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to take it to the next level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say?" said Lightning.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruska's participation in the culinary academy by saying that she considers the whole thing to be his personal activity that goes beyond television.
He dealt a major blow to Hruska Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
It sold over 300,000 copies in just a few days!
The new show that Prima announced yesterday at the press conference for the fall broadcast schedule is an authentic cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show Teraz gotuje szef in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his shirt.
If he had my face on it, I'd be laughing so hard.
"I'll just smile at the pear - it's a healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins", responded Lada.
He has his own ideas about Lada's culinary skills.
"Cooking Lada Peruska is out of the question even at home, because I won't let a gastropunk into my house", the chef is clear.
I respect Zdenek Pohlreich very much, I even make chicken with honey according to him.
But his recipes won't appear on my show", Hruska couldn't forgive himself.
He's such an asshole!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomically illiterate or a moron", Pohlreich said of Khrushchev at one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore", said Hruska.
A British inventor uses a microchip implanted in his hand to unlock his car and house with a wave of his hand
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in his body, enabling him to unlock his home and office doors and even start his car with a wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the same service through his company, BioTeq, to companies and individuals who want to use technology to simplify their lives.
Dr Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, is overseeing the implantation and follow-up procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a microchip-compatible door and car lock replacement service.
A married father of one has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4, which he starts with a wave of his hand.
White House props cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter onto the South Lawn to celebrate American manufacturing last month came at a cost of $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One when the president is on board, was the highlight of a July 17 White House tour of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials toured a display of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a Fragment Order, or FRAGO, requesting the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn as part of an "emergency" event, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event", the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's Deputy Chief of Naval Operations the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the parade, scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m., and would remain on site until the entire site was cleared, which was scheduled to occur between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail also stated that if there was a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent on the return flight due to working hours regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening, along with a helicopter and a unit of security personnel.
The records - obtained by TIME magazine - did not indicate whether a second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We wondered if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was fine", the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you've been blocked", replied the deputy commander.
This "Made in America" show has been designated by the White House as an official event and therefore would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
During his appearance at the event, the president championed health care reform as it passed the Senate and spoke of his efforts to rein in government regulation.
The use of aircraft carriers such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation purposes is unusual.
Trump ordered the review in February after Air Force One hovered in the background of his first major campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida.
"The White House is delighted with the 'Made in America' exhibit, which showcases products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials", said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often practice landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn, rehearsing eventual arrivals with the President of the United States at the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump was attending the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 practice landings near the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew's current training, a government official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew another 11 hours of 'non-presidential support missions'.
The White House said no additional props were paid for with taxpayer dollars.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in any way in the negotiations to display the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost associated with the parade is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly rate for Fiscal Year 2017 DoD expenditure reimbursements for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit logs show a 30-minute commute from the Marine Corps Air Facility at Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"Reporting the cost to taxpayers based on reimbursement estimates is highly misleading", Walters said.
'These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.'
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD expenditure reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but include fuel, maintenance, and contract costs.
White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, advocated the use of a helicopter for the parade.
"The idea of this week's show is to showcase American-made products", Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they employ hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens have contributed to.
It is appropriate to recall that fact.'
It's unclear if Trump went to see the helicopter on his tour of the South Lawn, only that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know the Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I own three myself".
A young woman was trapped in a swamp at Moss Lake, and the police were on their way.
The girl left for the beach around 2:00 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of swimming, she was trapped in the swamp.
When she decided to use her cell phone to call a policeman for help, her battery was down to 12 percent.
"As a result, the police soon lost contact with her", said police spokeswoman Ivana Balakova.
Several police patrols went to the place she described, but finding the young woman was not easy.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through reed swamps for hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground under their feet again", Balakova added.
And so was the missing girl.
The officers were guided by the direction from which her cries for help came.
"In order not to lose at least that connection, they arranged for her to count down loudly", the spokeswoman said.
The police found the woman only at a quarter to five in a swamp in Borny.
She was on the verge of physical and mental collapse and showing signs of hypothermia.
An ambulance was called and took her to the hospital in Český Kolín.
Grandfather's connection to STAN?
From a desired bride, she becomes a salesgirl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz, it's as if the billionaire is telling voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
He also claimed that a politically disparate group of lesser-known mayors and independents had no national program for the parliamentary elections.
Her candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with Santa, regardless of his political views.
That's how Vit Barta started, and it didn't end well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors in the candidates, which Gazdík admitted, Dědek also cancels the favorite argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is precisely politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to polls.
Now they're easily replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
The total break with the People's Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the People's Party.
But if STAN's identity was suspected by only a few at the time, with the arrival of the Grandfather, even the mere identity game ends.
Not only Gazdík has long distinguished himself against ANO of Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated the following: "My goal is for the ANO movement, that is, the Mayor's movement, to gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections".
Let's hope he didn't get the moves wrong.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and he's not a billionaire by accident.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babiš, but unlike him, he will not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party for some time now, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to make the bride-to-be even more of a sellout.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party and now they're looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police dogs practiced helicopter flights on the bridge
Bomb-sniffing dogs and search dogs practiced helicopter flyovers at Bridge Lake today.
The police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
Both adult trained dogs and those still undergoing training were trained at Most.
In addition to the standard training of detecting sharp samples of explosives around the lake and searching for a missing stuntman, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter ride.
"The helicopter lands, the dog goes and immediately searches", said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or unable to start work immediately after a helicopter ride is eliminated from training.
"Usually, the handlers keep them in the garden, for example", Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specialisations in the Ústí Region.
German Shepherds predominate, but Belgian Shepherds are also on the increase.
The handler's been taking care of him since he was a puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will perform for us", added Tomášek.
The animal shall be subjected to repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, it takes its first tests at 20 months.
"Acute intervention takes about two and a half to three years", added Tomášek.
The length of police service depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve eight to ten years.
They usually live with their handlers.
Pablo Escobar is out of the picture and the Cali Cartel becomes the focus of the hit Netflix series
Despite the season two finale of Narcos revealing the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service - the first has already seen the first trailer and an outline of other villains.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Under the direction of four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company", only increasing their violence and bribing more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of the operation, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the Mexico connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running in local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be ignored", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as in all related electoral processes.
Local and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the electoral process, which has put international fighting on the back burner.
In this year's election, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government peacefully transfers power to the next.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission said 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters were women.
The one-of-a-kind brewery is making beer again.
Here's to good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted into a steam engine operation in the nineteenth century.
Years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was known mainly for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II, and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served as a state farm.
The work of destruction was done by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned compound was devastated and dismantled for building materials.
In 2007, however, new hope shone in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began repairing the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully studied and continue to study archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery thus looks much as it did in the 19th century, when its golden age began.
Their work was recognised when the Ministry of Culture declared the brewery a cultural monument and the building became part of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was solemnly restored.
If you would like to taste the excellent Lobeč beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořínsko, visit the tavern on the brewery grounds.
In brewing beer, they use kokořín water from a protected landscape area, malt from the Lobeč fields and hops.
The bar serves traditional pale lagers as well as dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, held Saturday and Sunday at noon and 1:30.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind in the world?
Such a unique structure was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, on top of a ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by an extensive underground passage.
This was to be the headquarters, barracks, ammunition and material stores, power station, engine room, and hospital.
However, the Munich Agreement halted construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced-concrete bunker was built and underground passages were blasted open.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who began restoring the unique building in the early 1990's, you too can visit it.
Access to the basement is now 75%!
In addition to the infantry hut T-S 73 with an exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed light fortification facility, two under construction infantry huts, trenches and a nature trail Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo, and breathtaking views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech structure was listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's Harbour near Rome, and the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotěšov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building over a beautiful garden.
A list he made, but unfortunately, it's a unique building that's in danger of disappearing.
But enthusiasts are not giving up and are holding many events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Evening for the Khoteshov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas, will perform, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of the magnificent extensive building, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look a Neanderthal in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno invites you to an unusual excursion into the deepest prehistory to the Stone Age, to the world of our ancestors.
You'll learn how Neanderthals were able to perfectly cope with all kinds of extreme climatic conditions, especially ice ages and interglacials.
Despite their simple material culture, they were immensely successful predators of their time.
You'll also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy was, their technological skills and hunting skills, but also their aesthetic sense.
You wouldn't think it was Neanderthal, would you?
See for yourself in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is held on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.

Chef Miroslav Kalina will be cooking, you will taste culinary specialties and regional foods, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich programme for children such as creative workshops, theatre, a bouncy castle, a Smurf competition trail and of course a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
A new free app, Pl@ntNet, will help herbarium students and plant lovers alike.
If they're wondering what plant they just saw on their walk, this app will tell them.
All they have to do is take a picture of the plant, and the app automatically recognizes the species.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Center for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools took part in the project, photographing and adding plants from their surroundings to the app's database with their teachers.
A new French app can be downloaded for free from the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French developers was to get as many people as possible to contribute their photos to the app, thus increasing the number of plants the app can recognize.
"Children who already have a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go into the forest", said project coordinator Ivana Poláčková.
On the basis of a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which it then assigns to the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French Secret Life of the City project allowed us to translate the app into Slovak and Czech.
Users are therefore welcome to contribute a photo of a plant that is not yet in the database after creating an account in the app.
"The French will evaluate whether it is useful and then add it to the database", Poláčková said.
GMB's concerns about the investment in the McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from the managers of McVitie's biscuit makers of a long-term commitment to the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that the company was silent for the time being about a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, which produces Hobnob cookies and Rich Tea, among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the whole area over the previous few years.
It added that employees and trade union representatives would be 'among the first to be informed' in the event of changes in the factory's operation.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB union expressed its concern that McVitie's 'will not deliver on its promises to fund and modernise production lines'.
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the developer about the needs of the community and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the employees are mostly drawn from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work in the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of jobs, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow manufacturing - the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturer like McVitie's".
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The manager of Tollcross Construction only received a letter from the GMB yesterday and the company will be issuing a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to staff and union representatives.
A regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were discussed openly at this meeting.
We discussed with our employees that, as with all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all of our facilities, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: 'We have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area in recent years, mainly in production lines and streamlining operations.
"We value the heritage of Tollcross and the surrounding area, "and any changes to the operations of the Tollcross plant "will be communicated to employees and union representatives immediately".
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their quest to get Neymar on their side after paying £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of his contract, but did the French team warn Barcelona of their record-breaking move three years ago?
The sensational move has roiled the summer transfer market, with the Ligue 1 club poised to more than double the previous record transfer fee paid for Paul Pogba by Manchester United, who paid £89 million for him last season.
Once the transfer is confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, earning over £500,000 a week from PSG after taxes.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has been extricated from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world made aware of this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club interested in signing one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not afraid because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely reach out to one of their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to take one of our players, they will face the consequences".
Barcelona appear to have crossed a line this summer when they expressed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that under no circumstances will they allow the Italian international to leave, so it's possible that Barcelona's reckless behaviour is paying off with Neymar's departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has agreed to sanctions against Russia.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And the day before that, Trump tweeted that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not continue to do so.
Even that smacks of sanctions.
You can't lump those things together.
Maduro's Venezuela is indeed on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China just isn't behaving the way the American president would like.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But if one wanted to summarize all this so that even the average voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what the sanctions policy is all about and the system of rules that underpins it, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is just finishing what President Obama started, just giving it an executive stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, he would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible thought.
In practice, however, the opposite is true.
With Trump, sanctions are tightening, not loosening.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Foreign Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Are you saying kosher means sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council?
Then the EU sanctions against Russia are not kosher.
European Commission President Juncker has complained that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Are you saying sanctions should only be used if they're weak enough not to endanger anyone?
The average voter is stumped.
For three years, he's heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends solely on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now we hear it's about the EU's energy security.
The voter's grasping and spreading.
Sanctions are coming down on Russia for putting too much where it doesn't belong.
China has been criticized for not assembling enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a pattern, an order, a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I'm not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Apart from the Pardubice region, he has all the candidates ready.
By his own admission, he did not interfere significantly.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian should be led by the governor and the shadow minister of education of the ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a governor", Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You've angered many MPs and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors should run towns and cities themselves, with only managers.
- Are you serious?
That's not what happened.
I'm a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly and I believe we should elect mayors and mayors as well.
In my book, I don't talk about suspending deputies. They can be there.
The question is, how many?
At the presentation of your book What I dream about when I'm asleep, I overheard you talking about abolishing the councils.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five congressional districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million inhabitants, has 1,171 deputies.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she doesn't have the competence for that.
The same goes for the government, which has only been led by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did a good job.
But the current Prime Minister doesn't run anything, he just moderates the debate.
It can't work like that.
Is that why you're pushing for a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to sell.
All we have on the agenda is a change to single-member elections for the Senate.
We have also proposed a rolling mandate for ministers and an amendment to Parliament's Rules of Procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and commissions from being displayed in Parliament's meetings.
It's certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That, as dictator, you would run the government, control the House of Representatives with 101 members, abolish the districts and the Senate and, through grateful mayors, rule the entire country.
That's definitely not it.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislative body by a third, while there is one lawmaker for 57 thousand French, while in our country it is 17 thousand Czechs.
Macron, of course, is not accused of threatening democracy.
Even if someone were to win an election in the Czech Republic with a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
But the odds of who has a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There's nothing like that in the YES movement.
We just need a team in government that works for the people, not for their parties or departments.
For example, I don't understand why we couldn't agree to increase the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social workers.
Why did they outvote me and give a 21% raise to GIBS members who already make 60 grand?
If you were Prime Minister, would you go along with that?
The Prime Minister has to intervene when ministers behave inefficiently, confuse the government with a travel agency and want to do business with state money like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers aren't supposed to argue in cabinet, they're supposed to settle their differences outside.
The cabinet must have the finished material, there is no room for coalition splits, power votes and deals, that's where decisions should be made.
How do you expect to have a cohesive team if the ministers behave mainly partisan?
There's constitutional law above the pages.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement was no longer valid, and fired Babis from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a person and has the ability to rule, there is no need for such empty gestures.
He measures everyone the same and demands perfection from all.
Have you decided who you'd like to nominate for Treasurer?
I'm not even thinking about it. I mean, we're probably not even gonna be in that government. Nobody wants to work with us.
That skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have won the businessman Dede, who would like to work with you, and the populists may win the wing of your supporter Jiří Čunk.
I don't think you are.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO.
I'd leave that to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and ANO Vice President Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with the SPD of Tomio Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okomu are a viable coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history. He ran as a puppet for Vita Barta, then raised money for his company from Dawn. There was a coup.
He's obviously a strong personality.
A little brown, though.
If I look at his program, he has broad participation of people in the management of society, direct democracy, I can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking.
I wonder if it's acceptable for you to have a man who holds xenophobic views, speaks at rallies with gallows, and wants to leave the EU?
We're not considering cooperating with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the Communists' tacit support for your minority government?
I can't imagine that either, but the voters will decide.
It'll be a negotiation between the winner and the runner-up, but God knows who the winner and runner-up will be.
Of course, it's important that they be able to agree on a programme for a coalition government.
Let's get back to your attempt to run the state like a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition things like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did that, CEZ took control of the Czech government.
It is indeed unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the General Assembly of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel structure of the Supervisory Board and replace CEZ's top management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm going to be Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
Rumor has it that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He'd like to exchange his good cooperation with the CSSD for an even better one with the ANO.
Well, maybe after the election, things will pick up.
I don't know nothing about that.
I don't have a lobbyist named Humble or Rosie, I'm an independent unit and I'm not handling this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the management of CEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, the institutions you criticize?
I want CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been able to do what he wants for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, it never controlled it, it was only there in numbers, which is bad.
It's a trivial matter to me.
CEZ is supposed to take the Dukovans, value them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a tender or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear units is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows are waging a permanent purposeful campaign against me, but I do not and will not have the authority to fire anyone.
But controlling it is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about $7.2 billion a year in fees for public broadcasting, but they don't actually know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?

If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
