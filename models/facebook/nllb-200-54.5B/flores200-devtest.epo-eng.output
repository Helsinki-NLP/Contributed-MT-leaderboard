While one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the Ebola mortality rate, so far no drug has clearly proven useful for curing the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicate that it is less useful than desired in preventing death.
In a PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that the scientists were using it as a benchmark to compare three other drugs against.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes that the Olympic family certainly needs the development of a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widely held theory, but it also provides details that the fossils can't, like color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored underparts.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed stem, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers - branches and twigs - the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably a later evolutionary achievement than those other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but more likely for thermoregulation or display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile down, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur.

The work done was largely theoretical, however the program was written to simulate an observation made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team searched for the effect caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy surrounds the galaxy like a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "very much disturbing and alarming because it has a very high mortality rate".

In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically simple experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place the pre-printed sheet of paper with an indication of their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest to the absence of envelopes before the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and entitled voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each phase of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since remained in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with his son's murder.
She is being held pending formal charges and sentencing, but any testimony by a witness can be influenced because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently, and courts view the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists do seem to be approaching a dangerous line when they publish photographs or other details of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, has made it clear to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution has been made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to have on the basis of the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other relevant issues, it is said, will include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
Gunmen in the assisted pest control trial had to be closely supervised by the foresters while the trial was studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sport Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are being recruited for the Shooting Sport Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy to the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the NPWS, the four gunmen selected for the first shooting operation were given detailed instructions on safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's first CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the failure to organize elections, some of which have been postponed since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of non-functioning iPods are reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) reported that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week MEKI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 new incidents of overheating, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong as hostages after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been released and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then substituted for an elderly woman who needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed his father's example and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his free time.
His research showed that hormone delivery accelerated fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as I was...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II were the last Australian monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his ability.
He was unable to use medication needed to relieve his pain because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
A number of people confirmed the discovery, using a variety of devices and software, until the early days of February, and it was declared on Tuesday.
Comets may eventually be a source of water supply for the Earth, and also of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets began colliding with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He will probably try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is operated, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, no car parks or park-and-ride facilities are to be found in the area.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors, without supporters.
A study appearing Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process probably took longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes. It can be rolled into thin shapes.
It can be pulled to make a thin wire that can be folded and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into a sheet.
And you can make it very thin and stick it to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using beetroot juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, compress them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers and make you feel weird and look like a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to an elaborate network of gutters.
Remains of guttering have been found in the houses of mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
You need a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing made possible by the wheel is the provision of much easier and faster transportation.
That's why we have a train, a car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey in the scale from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats), which eat the much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a specialization that each cat retains, whereby they do not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, they live in groups called herds.
A herd consists of one to three related adult males and many to thirty females and offspring.
The females are usually closely related, like a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function quite similarly to prides of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to the prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of raucous, exclamatory words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds whenever they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and also move very inconspicuously. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment and then jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) divides from the main population from which it originated (as if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from where they were before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will have to, to be a strong competitor, have other characteristics or adaptations compared to those they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take away carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetables. Without vegetables, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the tallest predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its roof of the mouth, which meant that nothing that met it could escape.
It's not certain, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus wouldn't stand a chance against it.
Although we would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their array of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a gnat.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have feasts together, where they would lie on their sides while eating their dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome there could not have been foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, they didn't have tomatoes, they didn't have potatoes, they didn't have cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctum, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and along the way further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote this, it is known that in early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for holding.
So it's likely the note was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south still remained unfree.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks the Americans and the Free French Forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and this also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting cultural trace and a fairly large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with a congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it entrusted execution of its decisions to agencies of the states, which were often uncooperative.
It was also not allowed to override tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all states before any change, and states related to the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, and also the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the composition/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings began long ago in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company founds a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the indigenous ways of grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for photographing still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but what is more important, its aspect ratio was inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS, for example) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The much reviled and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamism, keeping a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became an object of critical investigation.
Over the course of more than a thousand years, the Christian religion linked European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power touched everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church coffers exist specifically for that purpose.
For over a thousand years the central authority of the Church was in Rome and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this dogma is being obeyed.
Shortly after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by a number of international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of an ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since such a tactic had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutalities of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the previous workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of representing different periods of time; each era in China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Also between all dynasties there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of such periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those periods fierce fighting took place between many nobles struggling for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover after the Revolution posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks previously based on class, they are now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this daily life. He frequented a cave, which became known as "Hira'" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved over time, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it's there.
Nothing else can be seen except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains a number of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples many were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch up" mark looks like a V and the "arch down" mark looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the heel (that's where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a more delicate sound, while a downstroke is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth on 6 October 1789 were brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of common women.
They traveled to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd, who were making noise and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The military expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to reimburse a large part of the expenses and the percentage of the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits extracted from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped the foundation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which end by consensus around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic tied to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has for societies "consequences" essentially its own, and not socially conditioned.
One could say, for example, that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being designed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and with the passage of time, customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these, more in harmony with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the 12th century, its status declined mainly because the Crusaders brought back silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered on the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style had its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow communication, styles in the west could be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the great achievements of the period was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family alone.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize harvest.
Historically most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel disregarded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The features determining a subculture as distinct, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Subculturalists often mark their membership by a recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who during growing up due to neglect, bad luck or malicious mistreatment were not socialized by adults.
Some feral children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of a child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
Raised only by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (in terms of physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the certain caring animal, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and a teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is embedded in a software and must ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner if he acted on his own.
Children find themselves in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, but it happens nonetheless.
We see the guardianship system as a safety zone for these children.
Our trustee system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
A trustee must provide everything necessary, what they lacked in the house from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet give additional dimensions to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "lasting relationships" as new motivational aspects when they investigated the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech pointed out that people who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
The research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of visible variation.
Splitting and recombining remixes the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with the digestive system that humans have to meet its needs for amino acids from available plants.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: decreased growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest-to-get resources from plants would be proteins that we can get from leaves and beans, but those are hard for primates like us to digest if they're not cooked.
On the other hand, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain the essential amino acids.
Given all the circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat similarly to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep deprivation is the process of deliberately waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you're sleeping, it can be left on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Among other biorhythm-based options is to drink plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which will make you get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person has is negatively correlated with the degree of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the way to that goal is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
In the center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes and cultures led to the separation of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and feature real battles, with surplus armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army moved in and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions, breaking the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of a navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
Most notable among the recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds roaming on hills and other pastures, often tended by goatherds, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although train tracks were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Splints appeared early enough to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a popular practice, but iron caused a faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known transportation was by walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as often.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus probably walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being friendlier to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is like anti-symptomatic medication in many cases. But if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we have to find the causes of the problems and we have to deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been profoundly changed by humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and problems have become greater because of humanity's overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by convention president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap posters.
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
Dunlap's 25 posters that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and lives today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, like a Tyrannosaurus.
Almost all currently used computers are based on information processing, which is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to preclude an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a medication or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Robins and budgies are both nest-builders, adapted to living in their host's nest or apartment.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or their child's best interests.
These couples may choose to schedule an adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents suspend their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to understand by scientific method how the world works. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it does not stand alone; it is also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning and observation guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that maintain a period of repetitive autonomous functioning even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the enveloped piece of genetic material, and whether the enveloped cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the view, including flora and fauna living nature.
Among the examples of on-site activity are hunting, fishing, photography, birding and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is going to Borneo and photographing and learning about orangutans.
Every morning people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and are overtaken by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere from one of its steady states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear this level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems attract such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because one cannot predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform arrangement; thus traffic flows tend to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, develop and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them more easily avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places against predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That made sense, since the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at one point six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one has ever succeeded in surpassing the pyramids of Giza in terms of the grandeur and technical skill of their construction.
Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements - such as gold, silver and copper - since antiquity, because these occur in nature in a basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter -- in the same order: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he went on to theorize that they become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
One can also have alloys in which there are small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good tool for a lot of people when it first came out.
But as new ways of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to lesser status and use.
People are now typing messages on computer screens without ever having to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, fissioning the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart with little or no contact.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It is less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to spill onto the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what causes people to act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized during maturation to adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about certain people that makes them want the things that they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is an effort to remain "one of the friends".
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, evaluate work performance, assign tasks and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you are transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done before, and take ownership of it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, such behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team because their teams can meet in different time zones, which can be misunderstood by their local managers.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the executive team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently across the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process where an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior leads scientists to continue the research.
It's been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The progress of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction feel, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves producing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Among examples are control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to diagnosis and questions from a client, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become discrete disciplines that are focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and warfare, and it is also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is another great way to think about a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, every year a new version of the website is released, but the old versions remain available for use as an album.
While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students more understanding of the world around them". The need to nurture the interest of the public inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own view of certain problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and it has an array of art galleries and museums that depict Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders think of as quintessentially Canadian.
Vast areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, some being almost uninhabited wildernesses.
This population comparison surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than all Canadian citizens combined.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are countries independent of or connected to France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it became deeply rooted in Comoros and Mayotte.
Europe's influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama pioneered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's useful to also wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should note that cultural differences can result in what would be considered chikan, and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to compromise (cultural or not, difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benimerines as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them with the name Casa Branca, but nevertheless they left after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there called it Casablanca.
In terms of shopping, Casablanca is among the least interesting places in all of Morocco.
Around the old city center, it's easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, ceramics, leather, hookahs and all kinds of glitter, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, covering most of the city streets with its magma, especially in the center of the city.
Goma offers adequate security, but one must be aware of every visit outside of it to know the state of the fighting that continues in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel through Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the red list of World Heritage Sites because of the desert's threatening sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocrodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, all of which support different wildlife.
It represents one of the main tourist attractions in South Africa and is considered to be the most emblematic of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entry fees for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the most interesting.
The line of buildings that creates the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a brilliant histogram, which is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross to the front, which is located at Kowloon Beach.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban growth is concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the north coast.
This is the site that the British colonists appropriated, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start looking.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) across the coastline further into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The portion of the forest in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forest, however, is not just a mangrove swamp. It contains some of the last refuges of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or swamps.
In 1966 Sundarbans became a reserve and it is estimated that in its territory there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 sighted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most leave between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Since the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are fast and comfortable means of transport to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 NIS) and Punakha (200 NIS).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters wide and it has two corridors 3,50 meters wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 meters apart. Construction finished in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are scheduled to be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Grande Province of the Indies", was founded as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo for tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), whose value has been equated to that of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be changed at the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but you can take British and American currency; ask beforehand to find out which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get below freezing, but wind and humidity combine and that's why you feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no separate "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities ask that you stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they look, bison, elk, deer, bears and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance. Because these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, keep your distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and is home to just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and it became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting at the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two harbours. The most popular are in three regions.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many drinkable wines from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may fare better.
It's perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you're in trouble.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of flat white coffee. Espresso is short black, a cappuccino has plenty of cream (not foam) and the tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Juices are expensive but excellent.
Throughout the year there are many trips to the reef and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signals, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubs appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, although they may occasionally appear outside this time.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites, through such agents.
Travel agents generally broker plans that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to get to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They may also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to provide you with other documents for the destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should, however, first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most of the attendees decide to camp on site and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to get a camping spot next to the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will be playing continuously until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with small children.
If you navigate the northern Baltic in winter, take care of the cabin location, because going through ice causes quite a terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are visa-free (check conditions).
Casinos usually try their best to make the guests spend the maximum of their time and money. There are usually no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and to keep them inside.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs mental capacity and every good gambler is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Everyone who will drive a vehicle in high latitudes or over mountain passes should pay attention to the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is low and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, the amount of snow that's able to block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or wind, condensation, ice on the windows of the car.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the most attractive thing for tourists in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The word "safari" is popularly used in the sense of traveling overland to view the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and ordinary tools provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a "field trip", "walking safari", or "walking") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Having hosted the 1964 Games, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you're probably in a tough spot.
Cancellation policies vary, but, in the case of late March, most cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron isn't available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you might try using a dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause it to burn).
There are different ways to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies and if you care about that, then consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or carry infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a human by force are generally not counted as plagues.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, occasionally traversing isolated forested areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be very careful: there are a lot of steep slopes, narrow corridors and winding roundabouts.
Signal speed limits are noticeably lower than those of forward and aft sections - often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and they are strictly enforced, even more so than otherwise.
It's worth noting that cellular coverage is however much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of the neighbor to the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain both apples throughout the year and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pastries usually go especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a huge term covering a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of spicy foods, with Javanese's favorite flavors being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Hanging from either side of the saddle, footrests serve as supports at the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present safety problems as the rider's feet could eventually get caught in them.
If you fall off a horse while riding with your foot caught in a stirrup, you could be dragged by a runaway horse. To minimize this risk, various safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and fairly narrow heel and sole.
Additionally, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars such that a falling rider can pull back to detach a foot strap from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important site for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer amazing views. Climbers from every part of the world are constantly creating new routes out of the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you glide down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are known as "ski addicts" and who plan entire vacations based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is considered a sport since at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first pleasure ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It refers to alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, but it usually does not involve them, as the latter takes place on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as if it were a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on maintained trails.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries one needs to go through visa applications and passport controls again.
The Schengen Area nevertheless functions in this respect as if it were a single country.
Provided you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what goods are antiques. Some tax agencies count as antiques goods that are more than 100 years old.
Because the definition varies by location, in places like North America the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts could be considered antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding its trade is also important to many other craftsmen.
Even in tradition, not all Lapps however engaged in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they lived from fishing, hunting or something similar, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays many Lapps work in modern jobs. Tourism offers important income to Lapland, the Lapland region.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
It's also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even if it's directed at their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than those facing Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information you can get elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and consists of different types depending on location, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Gale, hail, excessive precipitation, and forest fires are presentations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable for travelers to be aware of any risk of severe weather that affects their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for a course for hostile environments will most likely turn up the address of a local company.
A course in general will cover much more in detail all the issues presented here, normally with practical experience.
One course will normally last two to five days and will include acting, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wilderness, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they carry valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness to issue passports without an indicated gender (X) or updated documents consistent with a desired name varies from government to government.
Whether foreign governments are willing to accept these types of documents also varies greatly.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive in the aftermath of 9/11.
Unoperated transgender people should not expect to pass the scanners without having their privacy and dignity violated.
Surf is a backwash of waves breaking on a beach, often a reef or similar location.
Due to the diversity of underwater formations, the retrograde flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, where a rapid flow to depth can occur.
Most of the deaths occur as a result of trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
As soon as one swims out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been spotted, you may prefer to wait to be rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
By the time you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from the native culture.
When one first traveled abroad, people likely had patience and understanding, because they were aware that travelers needed to adjust to the new country.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed with the travelers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Here you will mostly hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The tale of sound and light is just like a novel.
The sphinx is placed in the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and they have the most bases, sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, whose flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Having united with the plateau here, the mountain range of the peninsula later re-emerges forming the Ellsworth mountain range, which is 360 kilometers long and is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak Vinson is 4892 m high.
In very remote areas without access to mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be the only recourse.
A satellite phone generally isn't a substitute for a cell phone, because you have to be outdoors in clear view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider could give you more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a sabbatical, traveling and studying are increasingly popular.
This is particularly popular among those who finish secondary education, as it gives them a year off before going to university without risking their education.
In many cases, if you go on a gap year abroad, it can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you get back home.
There will normally be an application fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for all kinds of yachts, smaller boats and even kayaks provide a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one out of every seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is seen only in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is a rather unique statistic (e.g. in the Netherlands one out of every forty people has a boat).
Most of the various Baltic cruise ships also include a stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can fully use a couple of days to visit the historic city, returning to the ship at night to sleep there.
If one disembarks only on the cruise excursions, a separate visa is not required (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany. As you can see at the top of the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience regardless of age and background, especially if you've never flown before or if you've been through a traumatic experience.
That's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and related aversions that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that comes from not knowing or controlling things.
Courier companies get good money for fast delivery of goods. Time is often very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem on other routes and small companies.
If they sent goods by chartered plane, on some routes it could take several days to complete unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do this faster was to send things as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, you can't send a baggage without a passenger, and here you have to take the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a very fat stack of bills for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
It's not cheap though: according to a rough estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it's not worth the effort to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any UN member state.
The economic ties were resumed between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial center, located on an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
Between the wide boulevards, the glass-fronted buildings and the modern shopping centers, traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century bazaars and old mosques and churches are scattered, but the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the church yard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through the intriguing village.
To the north and easily accessible lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron praised its great merits.
The bus line 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, which is the site of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and also a place of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their passage here and there are still many more people who had loved ones who were killed or worked to death here, Jews or not.
Please conduct yourself at the site with as much dignity, solemnity and respect as it fully deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the area with marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the posters are only in Catalan, as the law has declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are only in Catalan, but the unscheduled interruptions are announced by an automatic system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Residents of Paris have earned a reputation as self-centered, unfriendly and proud people.
This is often an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to maintain good relations with Parisians is to behave as if you were "bien élevé" (well educated).
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir, and it presents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the variety of microclimates, different types of terrain and different elevations.
The region is also home to extremely diverse animal and bird species.
There one can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and aurochs, in addition to many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear knee-length skirts and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide linen for women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own linen, especially if it is brightly colored.
Similarly, men must wear knee-length pants.
You can also borrow it from the storeroom at the entrance, but they don't wash these clothes after every use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomato and any available ingredients, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie meaning you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably also facilitates reading, but writing becomes a bit more complicated because it is necessary to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in the noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Moreover, it is necessary to pronounce r and rr differently: tsar means dear, while carro means chariot.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
Therefore, reading this grammar introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you speak a Romance language, it will make learning Portuguese easier.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it is not worth learning it separately.
In general, pre-modern observatories are today obsolete and they remain as museums or educational facilities.
Because back then, light pollution wasn't as big a problem as it is today, they're generally located in cities or near universities, places that are easier to access than those built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Since plants look best in a natural environment, don't give in to the temptation to get rid of specimens, not even "just one".
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out without discussion.
Singapore, in general, is a very safe place and very easy to explore. Once you get there, you can buy almost anything.
But still, since you will be in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to fight the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme on which to base a holiday.
Thus it would be possible, for example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or to go on a cruise ship to interesting cities on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays. It celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere throughout the world have adopted many of the traditions about this holiday.
Traditionally, the Easter night is spent awake in the open air to see the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could have been a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
On the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil and the congregations start celebrating at exactly midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived at the archipelago came either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, that is, the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark most of the time.
You can also enjoy the stars, as these areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are the normal working clothes and co-workers address each other by surnames or job titles.
Workplace harmony is paramount, as is emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers must usually receive approval from their superiors for all decisions made and they must obey instructions without question.
