This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as their colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on top with a straw or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides a first glimpse into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure, called a rachis, but instead have other feather features - barbels and barbules - researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the scapula shows adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.
Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the scapula shows adult plumage and no chicken feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured people were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant of responsibility for the attack.
They found that the Sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made of many small particles.
Television reports showed white smoke rising from the plant.
Local authorities are advising residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not to drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
During an interview, he stated that the new variant was "very worrisome and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have picked up the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital.
Over the course of a year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total number of people with TB still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their choice of candidate inside an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of electors.
French electoral law codifies procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes were added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the proceedings. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are referred to as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with his son's murder.
She is detained pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted by the fact that her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks that "journalists really seem to be walking a fine line if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which generally deals with prosecutions, has advised the press that no further comment will be made until charges have been laid.
The document, according to the leak, will address the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would be discussed include the future status of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Participants in the supplementary population control trial were to be closely monitored by guards, while the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the park's acting director of conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt operation have received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures that will lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The department responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to study preterm labor in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered it would speed up the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first food. Luna went through the night of the two moons. She is truly unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as messed up as I was...maybe more so...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who were polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29 per cent of people surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100- and 200-metre freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain since it was banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest prime to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using computer hardware and software since the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly have been the source of Earth's water supply along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the beginning of the year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine an aircraft's position with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and the underground trains do not stop at Wembley and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on the ground.
Fears of transportation shortages raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without his team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes.
It can be drawn into a fine thread, which can be twisted and twisted.
It could be made very thin, and encased in another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using beet juice.
Strawberry juice changes color depending on the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their protons stripped from them (whereas hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Stir both dry powders together and then, with clean, moist hands, beat them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had public toilets with water in almost every house, connected by a sophisticated roof system.
Remains of roof systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also communes in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, communes were sometimes a part of public bathhouses where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
Unless you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the litter, a special job each cat has that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Groups of lions are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions act as packs of wolves or cubs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but more like a phrase of hoarse, howling words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will eat monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals for food (prey) by scent, recording their movements on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, both populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants derive their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which meant that it had no way to escape anything that crossed its path.
His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it is possible that he was also a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would have been no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebratory items, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a missara.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food while seated on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they were spread apart while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted football.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple court and then an inner sanctum where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were merely open counters overlooking the street.
There were no significant forests in the land of Canaan, and thus timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. It is told in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he travelled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even before its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
And so, it's likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings, and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in an invasion code-named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a cognate of the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines in some way the extent of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the passing of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural weight and an equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, because it had no national executive or judicial branch, relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states took over the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, together with the Germany national football team, the second most successful national football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of Japan's large number of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format for still photography throughout the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat surprisingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while preserving a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the villain.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many people question whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all vessels from entering whole sections of the ocean, causing further danger to neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to these tactics, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his employer in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of China or ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates allowing only the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
It was the same in the military because instead of having army ranks based on rank, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The shroud itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the tomb is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful overcast sky and the many surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "high bow" mark looks like a V and the "low bow" mark looks like a letter or a square missing its bottom.
Up means you should start at the point and throw the bow, and down means you should start at the top (where your hand is holding the bow) and throw the bow.
A high bow usually generates a softer sound, while a low bow is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own marks with a chalk, but remember that printed marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were sent back from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriage fully opened.
At one point a member of the populace waves the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to repay the money for a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would constitute the basic earnings of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars is to understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological drive or technological imperative to a narrower sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Even a national road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new care techniques to repair bodily damage.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of capital of fashion from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the west could only be traced back 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of this era was that as a result of the Crusades people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological, system using stored seeds originating in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which may include fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequent methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults during the time they were growing up.
Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a severely intellectually or physically disabled child.
Feral children may have suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or running away.
Others have allegedly been mauled by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully domesticated by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal adopting them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to be the easiest and most engaging way to learn, the platform goes one step further.
The Stage is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a novel learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of stage but so is the Trombone Man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Bridges are internalised into the software and have the function of questioning, prompting, and explaining procedures that may have been too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the Foster Care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
Host families are supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting their microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who were unable to understand speech due to brain damage were nevertheless able to judge sincerity accurately.
He further suggests that such capacities for interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic children.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation in both directions between any two stocks in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid requirements from resources available in plants.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the readily available proteins in leaves and vegetables, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, mushrooms, eggs) are not only easily digested, but provide large amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively gentle wake-up call to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded upon by the Mahayana path of love and by some of the techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of divinity. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. Since the end of the war confrontations over systems, processes and culture have led to a rift between these countries.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been shattered, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar herders. These pastoral methods are still employed today.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted merely of parallel wooden posts, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, it was realised that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band over them.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more environmentally consciously, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It is only a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we only want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems, and we should disable them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater as a result of humanity's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks farther to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Leaflets".
The first public reading of the document was given by John NIxon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Most paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still belong to dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic chemicals in the home.
You should check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an early familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Bed bugs and assassin bugs are both nest-building insects, adapted to live in a nest or their host's housing.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to have an abortion.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific inquiry.
However, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations also guides scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle period of free running even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphor or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place from which they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle everyone is in some way connected to, and supportive of, a private car-based transportation system.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not work properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, conductors tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, circulating currents tend to have some consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as other stars).
And that makes sense, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some four miles (6 km) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed for their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were many thousands of years older.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the most sparsely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature in native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
And so, the crayon was a good friend to a lot of people when it first appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the chalk was relegated to lesser status and uses.
People now type messages on computers or computer screens, without ever having to go near a typewriter.
One can only hope that the keyboard will come when something new arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to knock together a nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a little bit like rolling a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to separate with little or no push.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
There may have been more sea on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them envious of the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another transforms into an unacknowledged individual who feels he or she must change everything the team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of his or her team.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams can meet across varying time zones that may not be covered by their local government.
The presence of an actual "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to research on cognition.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for constructing simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such cases have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, while they have been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also an excellent way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol, and each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make strenuous efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces students to become more curious about the world around them".[1] The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to material on the Internet, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as highlight their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's delightfully bilingual capital city and features an impressive array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies much further south and to the north is the Muskoka Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and beyond.
All of these things and more have enhanced Ontario into what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
The large expanses further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and an isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, establishing a significant presence in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that seems too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider teasing and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
You must be firm when rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend the territory (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who had established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of dishes, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the far eastern coast of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city streets, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano together with one of Africa's least expensive mountain gorilla treks.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stages during Henry Louis Gates's Wonder of the African World special broadcast on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's top tourist attractions and is considered the hallmark of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are fees for preservation and daily entrance fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location that many tourists consider to be its main attraction.
The succession of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you need to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the area that the British colonists claimed as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the interior of the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps though - they comprise some of the last remaining patches of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which around a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 wild deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurús and Payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
During the 16th century Paraguay, which was formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", arose as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical regions; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) are frequent.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park authorities, one must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and most other large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance.
In addition, you should be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking unwholesome food and keep a clean field.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of an infamous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the death of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch to Long Bay in the north and Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shady spots provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family friendly and sometimes busy beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to choose from, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign.[citation needed] A short black coffee is an 'espresso', the cappuccino comes well heated with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to schools are made throughout the year, and accidents due to any of these causes in schools are rare.
However, you must take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear along beaches and along river estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s. They may occasionally be encountered outside these times.
Snakes do exist, though they rarely attack humans. Most snakes are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or some combination of flights and hotels.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests for this should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get up early to get a campsite close to the music.
Please remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camp roles for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing the ice causes considerable noise for the most affected people.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by patrons.
They usually have special food and drink and entertainment offerings, to keep customers happy, and to keep them in their seats.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages on the premises. However, drunkenness impairs judgment and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Those about to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or wind-blown snow, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, conditions under ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland journeys to observe magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to stay close to cars and standard equipment will allow good observation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "safari excursion", or simply "footing") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having previously hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the report was released, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for competitions will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Straightening wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for rent, even if there are no gifts in the room.
If a flat iron is not available or you do not have a strong desire to wear flat shoes, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
You have to be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause overheating, or in extreme cases, severe burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a business, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter noxious animals with which they are unfamiliar in their home regions.
Rodents can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, do not fall into the category of harmful things.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy products free of duties and special taxes in certain areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, frequently passing through isolated patches of rainforest.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a cool head: ski slopes, narrow roads and tight turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are markedly lower than in the preceding and following sections - frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are very good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit in pastry is frequent, with apples baked in cakes year-round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, sounds like Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that Javanese favor are cocoa beans, chili peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can create safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to become trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be knocked off if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a bit of bridle leather to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits include impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes between its infinite potential walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow slope with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire ski-centered vacations in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in 1861, the first leisure skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to but does not usually include alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You can think of a ski itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover relatively greater distances than by walking - but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control many times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions to some extent as a country in this case.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured objects are antiques; some tax agencies define goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variation, as the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be defined as old, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income for the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
More traditionally, not all Sami have participated in reindeer herding on a large scale, but have lived by fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
Although commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, although their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any type of weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of inclement weather, as are storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for 'hostile environment courses' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course should normally cover all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing, many elements of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they carry valid documentation for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender not indicated (X) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents simply varies from place to place.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the ebb and flow of waves that break away from the beach, often onto a rock or something nearby.
Because of the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current to deep water can form.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim to shore against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a place where you will not be trapped again or, depending on your abilities and if you have been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Backlash occurs earlier than culture shock (and less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to their new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show is one of the area's main attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The story of the sounds and lights is simply like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4,892 metres (16,000 ft) at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel to learn.
It is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a gap year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year to study abroad can actually improve your chances of entering higher education when you return to your home country.
There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are effectively large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This coincides with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic Cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for a couple of full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you go ashore only as part of the ship's excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a city tour is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not being able to control anything.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering items quickly. Frequently, time is of the essence for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger airlines had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If goods were sent by air freight, on some routes, it may have taken days to go through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to get it through more quickly was to send it as checked baggage.[citation needed] Airline regulations do not allow checked baggage without a passenger, which is where it comes in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay at least four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy center of commercial operations, set around an immense bay and surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting carvings of marble doves on some of the graves.
It is worth a half-hour's walk to this quaint village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous to foreigners by an abridged account of its splendors documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you must also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are primarily visiting a site of mass graves and also a site that has an almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and even more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked here until their deaths, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by writing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to show off in Paris is still to prove your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (very polite).
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you try some basic courtesies.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying elevation levels.
The region is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna can be found including the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, dog, lynx, wildcat and wild peacock, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide shawls for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men were required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pantry at the entrance but this garment is not washed after each use and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these slippers.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean countries, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (usually pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is oil bread: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation varies with the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r's and rr's differently: caro means car, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the type of problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to reach than those built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, early cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to pick "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, picking a few "specimens" will also get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to travel and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything as soon as you arrive.
But since it is located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will need to manage both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You need to check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base theme for a vacation.
These include visiting castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or taking a boat ride on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries throughout the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some exposed spot to watch the sun rise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often celebrate an Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Easter week, with congregations often beginning celebrations as early as the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland mammals were unable to make the journey which made the giant tortoise the main land animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less continuously.
Since areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Costumes are standard work attire and colleagues address each other by their surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with an emphasis on group effort rather than praising individual performance.
Workers must often obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
