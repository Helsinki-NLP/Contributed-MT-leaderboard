Not only does this prove that some dinosaurs had feathers, a popular theory, but it also provides details that fossils usually do not, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is chestnut-red above with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
Their discovery also gives food for thought about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a finely crafted shaft, called a rachis, but have other featherlike features - tendrils and small claws - researchers have suggested that the shafts may be a late evolutionary improvement as they appear.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control as shown. Researchers suggest that even if this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the feather sample shows an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, even if this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult lower jaw rather than a lower jaw.

The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

Much of the work was speculative, but the program was written to replicate extended observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for is what causes the gravitational forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides to rise and fall, so the Milky Way pulls on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory says that much of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is located around the galaxy as a halo, made up of many small particles.

He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence of the witness may be tainted by the widespread publication of his photograph.
This is common practice in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts view the publication of images as potentially discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee writes that "journalists seem to be walking a fine line when it comes to publishing images that resemble puppets".
The Crown Office, which has been at the center of the prosecutions, told reporters that it could not comment further until charges were filed.
The document, according to the leak, deals with a border dispute, which Palestine wants to settle on the basis of the pre-1967 Mideast War borders.
Among the subjects it covers are said to be the future status of Jerusalem as a holy city to the nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel asks for a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave that military presence for only five years.
The shootings at the village pest-control experiment are closely monitored by the rangers, for the experiment is being monitored and its effectiveness is being used.
In conjunction with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were called in, through the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to prepare the nation for new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were due to the failure to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
Fewer than 60 cases of iPod damage and overheating were reported, leading to six fires and four people suffering burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving tools.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company considered "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas management office said no damage was reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center added that there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their buses in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued and fewer than six were confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers soon offered the job to an elderly woman who needed a shower.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth in his spare time.
Her research shows that when the hormone is released it accelerates respiratory maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua said that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer says "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. Luna died on the night of the two-month anniversary. She was different. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna is a comedian just like me... maybe even more... I love her and miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
In a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia's becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
A similar opinion was expressed by 34 percent of those polled, who wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the final poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist swam the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime discovered to date on January 25.
The discovery was confirmed by several people using different hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
The dunes may have been the world's birthplace of water along with organic matter that could form protein and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have struck the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political rhetoric and jokes".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save a million gallons of oil a year and cut carbon emissions.
This can be used in satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the exact location of aircraft and provide pilots with accurate information.
No extra cars were put on and the overground trains did not stop at Wembley, and on-site parking and boarding facilities were not available in the area.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game might have to be played indoors without supporters for the teams.
In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, the formation of a new species of bird was reported on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species have evolved in two generations, but this process is believed to be slow, due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus funch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a variety of shapes, from very small to very large.
It can be drawn into thin strands, which can be twisted and woven.
It could be made very thin, and attached to another metal. It could be made so thin that it could sometimes be decorated with hand-painted pictures in books called "mirror manuscripts".
You can make a scale using the source of red cabbage.
Cabbage root varies in color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Crush two dry powders together and, using clean, wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
It sits in your hand and interacts with the outer layers, which feel pleasant and form a shell-like structure.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, which was connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of a public bathhouse where men and women bathed together in an assembled army.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up your call and instantly relays it back to earth.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere bends some of the light they see.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The great things the wheel has done for us have given us easy and fast mobility.
This led to the development of trains, automobiles, and many other forms of transportation.
There are many smaller cat species that feed on smaller animals, such as rabbits, antelope, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on much smaller animals such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special object held by the cats that prevents them from fighting.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides may include from one to three mated males, and up to thirty females and children.
Usually the women were close relatives, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in temperament, and even more dangerous to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb (but not much), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
A tiger's roar is not the full-throated roar of a lion, but it sounds like a sentence with a violent, shouted message.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, frogs, and birds when they can.
Scientists speculate that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, attaching themselves to where it is on the ground.
With their night vision and stealthy movements, ocelots hunt for food by hovering over their prey and then swallowing it.
When a small group of organisms (small populations) becomes separated from the main populations from which they came (for example, by moving across mountains or rivers, or by moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than the one in which they remained.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different traits or habits to become more competitive than what it needed before.
Its original population remained virtually unchanged, needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the population begins to settle into its new environment, they begin to look different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of a new species. The inevitable result of speciation is that it is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants convert sunlight into food through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat mostly plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the foremost predator of smaller animals of its time, so it was fearless, except for its fellow Mosasaurs.
Its long snout is studded with 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that it is impervious to anything it encounters.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex are helpless against it.
While much of what they ate is familiar to us, the Romans had something strange or exotic at the feast, including wild boar, peacocks, voles, and a type of rat they called a dormouse.
One peculiarity was that while these poor people would sit with the woman and eat what they ate while sitting on the couch, the rich men wanted a banquet hall where they could wait on the side while they ate.
The diet of ancient Rome may not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for their gods, which they called god's house.
The people brought their sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to supply the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could go.
Sometimes towers shaped like strange pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
A special shrine to the god was at the top of the tower.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is rarely visited.
Much of Hebrew family life took place behind closed doors.
Women cooked in front of their homes; markets were open-air street markets; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not well forested, so timber was expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even without the discovery, the Eskimo tribes were still there at the time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have many different peoples, kings, customs, and histories.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
No one really knows who wrote them, it is known that early in his life, a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Hence, they may have added a notation as simple as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
Conquered by the French "Vichy". These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conqueror rather than against him.
On August 15, 1940, the allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had cleared the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture in which a large group of people live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and is also a measure of the size of a society.
City-states were the first to develop into nations. The culture of a civilization reflects the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting imprint of culture and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - only Congress was a part of it - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks the power to levy taxes, and, therefore, without a national executive or judiciary, they rely on government authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor does it have the power to change tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed and the states paid little attention to the central government and often had no representatives.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan's islands are grouped together, Japan's geography is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European seafarers named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, spearheading a revolution in aboriginal grain production and hiring Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized Taiwan's western and northern coasts and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu contains three main structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Pichu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the standard format of photographic film throughout the world is 35mm, which was the most widely used film size before the end of the analogue era.
It is still being created today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio is a legacy of digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35mm format is deceptive, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of this form (each measure divided by 12 to get the smallest whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are comparable to or closely related to this aspect ratio.
The oft-abused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This suggests that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the line that bisects the photograph of the three buildings and their beds (see example).
At that time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion united the European states despite their linguistic and cultural differences.
His far-reaching rule would affect everyone from king to commoner.
One of the basic Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church coffers are earmarked for that purpose.
The center of the church's authority had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and the location of its power and wealth made many doubt that this teaching would be followed.
Shortly after the war broke out, Britain began blockading German shipping.
The strategy, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, has proved effective, but this blockade violates the basic accepted international law provided by several treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area of ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
With a limited response to these tactics, Germany expected a similar response to unstoppable submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most people and countries was pacifism and individualism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were determined to avoid a similar catastrophe in the future.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to accept a job with the Siding Company in New York city.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of marking time; each part of China or dynasty was a different dynasty.
And between each dynasty was a tumultuous period of provincial division, the most famous of which was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times fierce wars have taken place with many rulers fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting just to occupy the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
Many of the social and political implications were the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation was a body of people rather than a single leader.
Moreover, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants allowing the ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true in the military, where the rank of a soldier has been changed from class to caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other nations to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in the supernatural. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which still exists today, gives clear evidence of Muhammad's interest in spiritual matters.
Perched atop a mountain north of Mecca, the cave was cut off from the rest of the world.
After all, even if we knew they were there, finding them would be difficult.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramids are one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" looks like a staple or a square with the bottom edge missing.
Upward, you start at the tip and push the arrow in, and downward, you start at the frog (the hand that holds the arrow) and pull the arrow out.
The up-bow is usually performed by a weaker one, but the down-bow is performed by a stronger and more stable one.
Do not hesitate to write your own score, but remember that the printed score exists for the sake of the music, so it needs to be honored.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two children (11 - year - old Marie Therese and four - year - old Louis - Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a group of women merchants, on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and uttering threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.
On one occasion, a member of the mob raised the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
U.S. imperialism's war costs for the occupation of the Philippines were finally paid by the Filipino people themselves
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial power of the United States to pay for a large part of the costs and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall street banks.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos constitute the principal form of U.S. Imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that motivated the formation of this organization.
The period during which those events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is a catch-all term that covers a wide range of current ideas, such as technological creativity or utilitarianism and the strict view that human destiny is governed by an invisible logic connected to the laws of science and what technology reveals.
Most interpretations of technological determinism make two assumptions: that technological production follows a path that transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology also has an "effect" on inherited traits, rather than on those conditioned by the trait.
For example, one might say that the motor car should lead the way in improving roads.
For example, it was expensive to build a network of highways across the country when there were few cars, so new methods of automobile production were developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership has also led to a higher incidence of road accidents, which has delayed the development of new health-care techniques to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography elevates individuals, and over time the practices and cultures associated with that geography come to the fore, and these, having a bearing on the meeting place, are superior to loosely applied laws.
Just as Paris was the famous fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople has been called the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the early twelfth century to the point that the Crusaders returned with silks and spices more expensive than Byzantine goods.
It was during this period that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the past clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine cultures in the east.
However, because of long-distance communication, western styles can last from 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe had begun to develop its own style. In one of the greatest upheavals of the era as a result of the crusades, people began using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the region and combines them with crop rotation techniques or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, many farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated from society and allow them to create a sense of familiarity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination thereof.
Members of a subculture often advertise their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion items, attributes, and language.
One of the common systems for illustrating the value of association is to take the rare frustrating cases of children who, because of neglect, misfortune, or abuse, did not have adult contact as they grew up.
Some feral children have been abandoned by their owners (often their parents); in a few cases, this abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Isolated children may have experienced extreme abuse or deprivation before being abandoned or fleeing.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; a few are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised by a nonhuman animal, a feral child displays characteristics (with physical limitations) similar to those of animal caretakers, such as fear or prejudice toward other humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, a scaffolding system is even better.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an aid that provides support for individuals learning a new skill such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and physical, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but is also a small paperclip person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in software and are intended to ask questions, guide, and explain in ways that may be difficult for students on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not supportive, nurturing, and educational, but it is unavoidable.
We realize that the Orphan Care System is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe haven, loving caregivers, a secure education, and trustworthy health care.
Foster Care is expected to provide for all their needs that they did not have in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of both mass and social networking.
The Internet's uniqueness results in an added dimension of uses and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al. , 1995).
"Personal contact" and "ongoing relationships" are distinct new areas of encouragement, say Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigate audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that can occur in milliseconds.
One in particular believed that it was possible to determine whether a person was lying by accurately interpreting minute expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Word, pointed out how a person can lose the sense of hearing because of brain damage and fail to recognize the truth that is good.
He adds that these human-reception abilities can also be inherited by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research has revealed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the mix.
Separating and combining restores and leads to a balancing of the differences between the two lakes with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to obtain the amino acids it needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.
The proteins in leaves and seeds may be the most readily available plant resources, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
The difference is that animal foods (ants, termites, eggs), besides being easily digested, provide high levels of protein with all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way that savannah monkeys do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of forcibly waking up during normal sleep and going back to sleep for a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done quickly with a low-powered alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness but does not actually wake you up.
If you have to set a timer when you go to bed, it may be moved to the opposite side of your room, thus forcing you to get out of bed when you turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, delaying one's waking to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive the life force that exists. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this purpose is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but the mahayana expands on the way of love with many more techniques from Indian Yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Along with Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened from yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Divine Yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. By visualizing various deities, energy pathways are cleared, chakras are released, and clarity of mind is created.
Germany was the arch-enemy during World War II, which led to the alliance between the USSR and the U.S.A. By the end of the war, systems, processes, and cultures were no longer compatible and countries were at each other's throats.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies, and the Cold War has begun.
This lasted for forty years and involved real warfare, proxy armies, fighting from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been destroyed, and their only hope was to retreat and reposition at the Romanian birdhead.
However, these plans were dashed almost overnight, when almost 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods was the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods overseas.
The navy's job is usually to ensure that the country stays within its ability to move people and goods, while your neighbor's ability to move people and goods is a factor.
One of the more interesting recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using only U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany might have defeated Britain with all of Europe at her feet.
Goats may have first been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for their milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually herded and allowed to roam on the hills and other pastures, often led by children or youths, much as a shepherd would herd his more familiar sheep.
Wagonways were developed as early as the 16th century in England.
Even when wagon tracks were made only of planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them to gain speed and to pull heavier loads even over bumpy roads during the day.
Crossties were introduced early to lay down tracks, but later, it was discovered that crossties could be made smooth with iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused further deterioration of the wooden frames of wagons.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first transport was by foot, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning erect man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as was the custom.
The unique ability to walk on two legs has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can take action to prevent more suffering in the future.
But if we do not want a temporary solution, then we should go to the root of the problems, and we should try to eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has changed as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and the rising cost of living.
After passing through Congress on June 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's nearby printing press.
Overnight 150 to 200 copies were made, now called "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Some paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things that birds have in common with dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and roots, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information written in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer speak.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately felt. Symptoms, such as vomiting, may be so different that immediate investigation is not possible.
The main sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals used in the home.
Refer to the label for the proper application of first aid for said poison.
The term bug is used informally by entomologists for these groups of insects.
This term comes from the ancient knowledge of Bedbugs, insects that easily parasitize humans.
Both the killer whale and the bedbug live with their owners, either in their nests or in their burrows.
In the United States as a whole, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple can decide if this is not in their best interests, or if it is in the best interests of their child, to raise the child.
These couples may be able to work out an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works by applying the scientific method, which underlies most scientific inquiry.
But more than that, it is an experiment, a test of an experiment used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questions, and observations and to guide further scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observable rhythms in physiology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the presence of an endogenous cycle and their reproduction by a biological clock.
Rhythms that are periodic, not simply responses to external signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks maintain their own oscillators that run continuously for a period of time without human intervention.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the most famous proponents of DNA as genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a microbe, or virus, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells have infected germ-line cells.
Only cell mutations in the germline can be passed on to offspring, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based Tourism invites people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the sights, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, trapping, photography, bird-watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small towns board buses to go to their workplace and meet people whose workplace is the same as theirs.
In this dynamic transportation system everyone is connected to, and supportive of, a transportation system based on private vehicles.
Today the conventional wisdom is that a large carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In wealthier lands similar complaints about water quality or a damaged bridge are seldom heard.
Why do transportation systems make such complaints, why do they not fail every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent?
Traffic Management is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with one another.
Even so, learning traffic patterns is difficult because of driver habits and is certainly not one hundred percent predictable.
Fortunately, drivers comply within a reasonably consistent range; so there are also traffic users who are reasonably consistent and can be described mathematically.
To illustrate better the arrangement of vehicles, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) arrangement, (2) number, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first birds, and their ability to fly enabled them to escape predators quickly and to find food and mates efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings to realign themselves.
This gives them more room to hide from potential predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot be tamed are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, along with the Sun (and other stars).
This seems to be true, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and the largest river on Earth, with more than eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being six miles wide at its widest point.
A full 20 percent of the water discharged from the planet's rivers into the seas comes from the Amazon.
The center of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it receives water from a number of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued into the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were not surpassed in size and workmanship.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian as the language of its legislation and official communications.
Italian was also the everyday language of most of those who worked, and Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
Everyone living in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they are found in nature and can be mined easily with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (of the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he assumed that they would differentiate into a new substance to form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many metals in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, as are metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys containing small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon, may also be available.
All matter in the universe is made of matter, all matter made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
Thus, the pencil came to be viewed as a friend.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil fell into disuse.
People today type on computers without ever touching a typewriter.
No one can say what will happen to the keyboard when someone new arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have compact nuclei, which means that they are bound together with little or no movement.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and 60 miles [100 km] thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the marsh and thicker below the highlands.
There may have been more marsh near the edge because the soil was thinner, allowing the lava to rise to the surface more easily.
Content theories center on the study of what moves people or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have specialized needs and/ or desires that they adapt to during their lifetime.
These theories look at what motivates people to want the things they want and what factors in their environment make them do or not do things.
Two of the most popular theories are Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In casual conversation, two traits may emerge as managers put their former colleagues first. One end of things is trying to be "one of the guys".
This type of leader has difficulty making difficult decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At one end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unknown individual who is so attractive that he has to change everything he has done in the group and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior is often the result of misunderstandings between leaders and other group members.
Artificial groups have the same standards as normal groups, but they also have subtle differences.
Members of a virtual group act as a talking point for their primary physical group.
They are often more relaxed than normal group members because their groups may meet in different time zones in places where the local driver may not understand them.
Being in a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a distinct part of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" of the governing body to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One purpose of implementing organizational learning concepts is change.
When all resources are used effectively across departments in an organization, creativity and ingenuity remain.
As a result, organizational processes work together to overcome obstacles and can result in new and better processes to better meet customers' real needs.
Before an organization can change, leaders must create a culture of change as well as a space for sharing knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuum approach as a method can be used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus narrowing the scope of research and making it more precise.
The correlation between pathology and brain properties supports scientists in their research.
It has long been recognized that various forms of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect personality and delay changes in certain thinking patterns.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides a wealth of information and materials to construct a simulation model that can help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI is largely associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, which studies ways to put habits, learning, and skills into a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become divisive disciplines , obsessed with providing solutions to life's real problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, having already established themselves in many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any school. A teacher is always happy to take his students to places the bus cannot reach.
Technology offers solutions such as virtual field trips, where students can see artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or view beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Participating in a virtual field trip is also a beautiful way to remember field trips and share experiences for the next class.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, which changes each year, but the old versions remain online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills by allowing them to practice their grammar and spelling while others read or see them.
Since students are often the readers, the blog writer makes every effort to be concise and well-written and to avoid embarrassment.
Blogging "stresses the need for students to be informed about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's curiosity encourages students to be informed and interested.
Blogging is a collaborative tool, and it encourages students to focus on their studies even when they are not in school.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to be critical and analytical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can make sense of their positions in the context of others' writing as well as present their own perspective on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and offers many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south lie Niagara Falls and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario shine as a Canadian destination for outsiders.
A large area in the far north is sparsely populated and the rest is almost impassable wilderness.
Many are surprised by this population comparison: There are more African Americans in the US than there are in all of Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is still the largest, and it is a continent apart in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are famous for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam inland, and it landed largely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influences and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.

Be firm in avoiding boys, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (culturally or otherwise, it is not an issue).
Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century BCE, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under a new name, Casa Branca, only to leave it standing after the 1755 earthquake.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and renamed it Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's least interesting shopping centers.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pariyo, leather, hookah, and various geegaws, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated when lava from the Nyiragongo volcano buried most of the town's roads, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, the current fighting in the province of North Kivu should be checked before any trip outside Goma.
The city is also a starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for some easy hikes in search of the African Mountain Gorilla.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Among its difficulties, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it even has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, because of the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Marveling at the African World.
The city is quite different from other cities in the country, being more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 7,500 square miles [19,500 sq km] and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flag bearer of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with South Africa's National Parks, there is a daily maintenance fee and a fee to enter the park.
It may also be helpful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into any of a selection of South African parks or into all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and what many tourists think of as its main focus.
The parade of skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart that dances gracefully on the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront.
The biggest part of the urban renewal on Hong Kong Island involves large areas of reclaimed land in the north sea.
This is the place that conquering Britons coveted and if you are looking for evidence of past conquest of territories, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove swamps in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) through rural Bangladesh and India from the coastline.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not barren but - along with a few others - the last remnants of the dense forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Suburbans area is 3,850 square kilometres, km2, of which about a third is wetland.
Starting in 1966, the Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, mainly eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in this district are often full of commuters, it is recommended that tickets be purchased a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
A cable-stayed bridge crosses the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 275 feet [83 m] high, 1,200 feet [378 m] long and have two rows 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The height of the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be put into use in September 2017, when customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group remaining in present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practice substantial agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who live by hunting, harvesting, and fishing.
In 16th-century Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the struggle between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December the biggest competition of the year is held on the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here the rest of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklang pound (FKP), which is fixed in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at one of the islands' banks located on Stanley across from the FIC West shopping center.
British pounds can be accepted everywhere on the island and within Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are often accepted.
Credit cards from distant islands are certainly not acceptable, but British and U.S. currency may be; check with the owners first to find out what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevido is in the subtropics; in the warmer months, temperatures exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are not uncommon.
Refrigerant can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the air and moisture combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no major "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains constant throughout the year.
Even if many of the animals in the park are there for people to see, the animals are still wild and cannot be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem to you, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost any large animal can be aggressive.
Each year, he dragged the injured to the visitors because they had not kept their distance.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep campsites clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.

In the midst of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland's two harbours have given it a wide variety of beaches, the most popular being at three locations.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with a safe swimming area, and most are in the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches on Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
At times, these beaches are crowded with families, with good shopping along the shore and safe swimming.

Sharks remain, but they rarely attack humans. Sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles Crocodiles do not normally live in the sea, their main habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the freedom to have accommodations when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with designated hotels, though other accommodations, such as camping sites, can be booked through an agent.
Travel agents usually provide a package that includes breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or a combination of airfare and hotel.
They may even cancel your reservation if you need more time to think about their offer or to obtain other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival headliners decide to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you really want to be close to the action you will need to get to the music booth early.
Keep in mind that even after the music on the main stages has ended, parts of the festival may continue late into the night.
At some festivals there is a special camping area for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as walking on ice can cause severe diarrhea for those affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises are only allowed to stay in the city for a certain period of time. Passengers do not need a visa (see policy).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by patrons, often with no windows and no clocks, and with exits hard to find.

Even so, drunkenness kills the buzz, and all good gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone driving at high altitude or over a mountain must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
If there is a snowstorm, a few inches of snow falling for hours may remain with you.
Scattered or drifting snow or ice on car windows may obscure the view.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris may be Africa's greatest tourist attraction and are a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage the word safari refers to overland journeys to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly the savannah.
Other animals, such as elephants and giraffes, may approach vehicles and standard equipment and allow a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk"",hiking safari", or a "footing") involves hiking, for just a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, first in 1964.

Many hotels have a clothes iron and a horse that can be borrowed, even if one is not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hand dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (causing it to crack, or even burn).
There are various ways to purify water, some more effective than others against specific hazards.
In some places boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others it takes longer.
Treatments vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you may want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they have never seen in their homeland.
Pests damage food, cause irritation, or in extreme cases can cause allergies, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans by force, cannot be called pests.
Buying from duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in other places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries sometimes save extra money, especially on such items as liquor and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, always traversing isolated rural terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: very rough terrain, narrow roads, and sharp curves are the norm.
Alternative: The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than for the front and rear sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and it is vital to obey them.
Surprisingly, mobile-phone service is stronger here than at many other points along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are delicious, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria.
Breads with fruit are common, such as apples, which are baked into breads throughout the year, and cherries and plums, which appear during the summer.
Many German breads also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes are often served with a cup of strong coffee.
If you prefer a small but rich loaf, try a regional variant called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on some herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the moisture content.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a blend of many different regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the word and can be traced to the central and northern parts of the island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a wide selection of lightly seasoned dishes, characteristic Javanese flavors favoring peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic seasonings.
The stirrups are the rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide great stability for the occupants but have a safety concern because they can be attached to the rider's foot.
If a rider falls and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, he may be pulled along by the horse when it is running. To reduce the risk, some safety precautions may be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and soft, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety bar that separates the leather footrest from the saddle when it is pulled by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's most climbed mountain range, called the Yosemite of South America, with its variety of sheer granite walls and peaks.
With breathtaking views from the summit, climbers from all over the world continue to break new ground on its endlessly traversable walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, which require sliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or snowboards attached to the feet, are popular.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, commonly called "ski bums", planning entire ski vacations in one location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings showing skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
This is related to but usually excludes hiking or mountaineering styled alpine skiing, the latter being performed on rough terrain and requiring sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good condition you can reach farther than you can on foot - but you will rarely reach the speed of a barefoot skier on skis laid out on a flat surface.
Europe is a small continent made up of many independent nations, and travel between them normally involves many visa and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, operates as one country in this respect.
If you stay in these areas, you can usually cross borders without passing through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to obtain visas from other Schengen member countries, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities classify items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the age limit being lower in some areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as old, even if they are younger than their mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer husbandry is the Sami's livelihood and a trading culture is also vital for many other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they made a living by fishing, trapping, and hunting, turning the deer into mere breeding stock.
Tourism is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
Even though it is widely used, especially by non-Romanies, the word "Gypsy" is considered derogatory because of its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romania.
If travel news breaks in your destination country, your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance may be affected.

For one thing, Americans in the Middle East may face different circumstances from Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory is simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The ideas presented here are often superficial, broad, and oversimplified when compared with the detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is any dangerous weather that has the potential to cause damage, seriously disrupt a situation, or take human lives.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many types, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, torrential rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, as are storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and typhoons.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include hail, snow, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the potential danger posed by severe weather that may affect the area where their travel plans may be affected.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be described as a war zone should get professional training.
An Internet search for "violent environment courses" can be outsourced to a local company.

Books and magazines about bush life are plentiful, but those written about wars are few.
Travelers who plan to change sex abroad should make sure that they have valid documentation for their return

Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to survive scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are backwashes of waves that travel out to sea, usually onto a reef or reef companion.
Underwater topology causes the return current to be concentrated in a relatively shallow area, and fast currents in deeper water may start there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from swimming against the current, which is virtually impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is not difficult.
Try to stay out of his reach, or, depending on your skill and alertness, you may simply have to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes earlier than culture shock (slightly less than during the honeymoon period), peaks much later, and may be more severe.
Travelers who quickly adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to return to their own.
When you return home after a stay in another country, you have absorbed new cultures and left behind the familiar trappings of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler to another country must conform.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers going home.
The pyramid light-and-sound show is one of the area's attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and see them quietly before the show begins.
Tourists and vendors are often in the background, and the story of sound and light reads like a storybook.
The Sphinx was turned into a spectacle and told a long story.
The scenes were shown in the pyramid and in other pyramids were illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are owned by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen of them active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 75 miles [120 km] north of the Peninsula, the largest island being King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception is located in the flooded caldera of an active volcano and offers a beautiful natural beach.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here converge at the ridge, then exit again to form the 225-mile [360 km] chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, splitting the Minnesota Glacier.

A satellite phone is not a perfect substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to go outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
They are regularly used for dispatching, including pleasure craft, as well as for expeditions that require long-distance data and call connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information for connecting to these services.
An increasingly popular choice for midyear planners is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before university, without gambling education away.
Generally, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year increases your chances of gaining entry to higher education when you return to your home country.
It is common to pay tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a beautiful vacation destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, lakes, and seaside towns.
On archipelagos and lakes you do not need a yacht.
Even if the archipelagos surrounded by the sea and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a popular pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand have resisted this, but they are still different (e.g. the Netherlands has one in forty).
Most of the Baltic's major ships make extended stops in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the ancient city for two full days while returning at night to sleep on the boat.
If you arrive only by cruise ship you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Several cruise ships offer brochures in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a tour of the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes that some people already have.

Freight forwarders are well paid for their speedy service. Time is often of the essence for business documents, purchases or spare parts for quick repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies, there is a problem.
If sent by air freight, some routes may take several days to clear customs.
The only way to get through quickly is to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to be carried as unattended baggage, and in these situations you get in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, let your company do it for you).
But the price is high: business class tickets can cost four times as much as regular economy class, and first class tickets 11 times as much!
In general, it is useless even to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a specific group of air travelers who are willing to pay any amount of money to get where they are going faster and more comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.

It can also be borrowed from the one available at the entrance but the garment has not been washed after use and you may not feel comfortable wearing such pants.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of its Mediterranean counterparts, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and all use olive oil.

The observatories of the pre-modern era are now generally abandoned, remaining as museums, or centers of learning.
Because light pollution in their day was not the type of problem it is today, they were commonly found in cities and campuses, more readily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities in a quiet environment with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
