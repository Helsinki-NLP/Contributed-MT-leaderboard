While one experimental vaccine appears to reduce deaths from Ebola, so far, no drugs have been definitively shown to be effective in treating existing infections.
One antibody drink, ZMapp, previously showed promise in the field, but official studies showed it had less benefit than sought in preventing death.

USA Gymnastics welcomes the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the Olympic family's core need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, may be best served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than revoking certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that will likely shed light on how the level of abuse so bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long and embraces important and timely change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have one goal - to make the circus, and each other, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and enabling environment.

Not only does this prove that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well established, but it also provides explanations that the fossil record as a whole cannot, such as color and triangular shape.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were reddish-brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed root system, called the rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers found that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for gliding but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the soft inner feathers of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, even if this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows feathers the size and not the feathers of a small chick.
A car bomb detonated at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

Brightness and orbit work together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to tidal flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star becomes in response to magnetic variations.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but a program was developed to simulate observations of the Milky Way galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that black worms affect other black worms in the same normal way.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is nearby in the form of light, and it is made up of many tiny particles.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain relatively constant temperatures, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, then place a pre-printed piece of paper showing their election candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law instead organizes the process in a code.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are put in except those of registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every step of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following a specific procedure.

He is in jail awaiting charges and trial, but any testimony of witnesses may be adversely affected because his picture has been widely published.
This is the practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be discriminatory.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists seem to be putting themselves at risk by publishing photos etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which oversees prosecutions, has indicated to the press that no further comment will be made at least until charges are made.
The document, according to rumors, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future of Jerusalem - a city holy to both nations - and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years if an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to remove the presence for only five years.
Target shooters in an additional pest control experiment were to be supervised by guards, as the experiment would be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at the NPWS, the four targets selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
Some 60 incidents of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional greenhouse gas emissions, which the company said were "not significant".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported injuries in the nation.
Similarly, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
Former Philippine police have kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later substituted for the elderly woman as she needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm labor in her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were used, it would speed up the development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the plane's 'black box' recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow boxers also cheered for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. As unique as she is. A strong woman".
Justin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was vulnerable like me ... maybe even more ... love her and miss her... hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, calling for Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Overwhelmingly, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have put his life in doubt.
He was unable to take the necessary painkillers because they are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest known odd number on January 25.
Several people validated the invention using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were the source of water on earth, as well as carbon-containing compounds that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially the formation of the Earth, from the collisions of comets in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "rumours and political nonsense".
He considered running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would allow planes to use shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate spacecraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being arranged and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks and parking and transport stations available there.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, because of interbreeding between Darwin's native finches, Geospiza fortes, and migrating cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven.
It could be made thinner, glued to other metals, and thinned until it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage syrup changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been identified (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders and then, with clean, moist hands, insert them into the rubber.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel different and form a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a modern latrine in almost every home, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where husbands and wives mingled together.
When you make a telephone call to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the phone and reflects it back to earth, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere interferes with some of the sun's light and with our view.
You don't need a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or a telescope.
The wheel has changed the world in remarkable ways. The greatest thing it has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
It has brought us trains, automobiles, and countless other forms of transportation.
Below are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to chamois and deer.
Finally, there are the many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that feed on small prey in abundance, such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a specialized job that each cat holds and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are one of the most social of the big cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides are made up of between one and three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually the most closely related to one another, being a large family of sons and daughters.
Packs of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit awkwardly), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times as hard as the strongest man.
The leopard is in the same family (genus panther) as the lion, the cheetah, and the leopard of South and Central America.
A leopard's roar is not like that of a lion but, rather, is more like a shouted rebuke.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that wild cats hunt are smaller than them.
Scientists think that feral cats track and locate prey by scent, sniffing to locate where they have been on the ground.
Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings rather than leaping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population from which they came (as when they cross mountains or a river, or move to a strange island from which they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or practices to be stronger competitors than they needed before.
The natural numbers have never changed, they still require the same old methods.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look more and more different from the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the greatest hunter of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its massive jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that anything that came in contact with it could not escape.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other crustaceans, and possibly a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or exotic feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on couches, the rich preferred to have a communal banquet where they could recline on couches while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets would not have included foods introduced to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted sweet potatoes.
The Babylonians built a basic temple, which they viewed as the dwelling place of each of their gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each fortress had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special towerlike pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple complex.
The upper chamber was the sanctuary of the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not of great importance.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; storerooms were simply open counters facing the street.
He did not clear the land of Canaan of its dense forests, and the price of timber was exorbitant.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further West, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" appear at the bottom of the document, from top to bottom.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment manuscript (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Hence, it is likely that the quotation was inserted as a symbol.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied Forces invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a cohesive culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which somehow describes the size of a society.
City-states take precedence over nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, its cultural permanence over time and its equitable distribution.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and without being recognized as fully developed civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with the U.S. Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on national authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to override the laws and tax lists of the provinces.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before amendment and the states mocked the federal government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national football team, the second most successful national football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, log hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the North, where Italians compete in international and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the world's 7th largest island!
Because of Japan's archipelago, Japan is often called, geographically, "the archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when passing English sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the houses on the outskirts of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still-image format is 35 millimeters, which was the main film size in the era of old-style cinema.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the emotional format of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this design (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common structures (the APS family of structures, for example) are equal to or approximately equal to this ratio.
The often misused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that builds efficiency while maintaining the level of order in a photograph.
It states that the place of greatest influence on the main subject is at the junction of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see illustration).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under attack.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion has bound the provinces of Europe together despite their different languages and traditions.
Its far-reaching power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church coffers exist specifically for that purpose.
The supreme authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money in one place led many to question whether this belief was being practiced.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian facilities, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law that had been coordinated by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire sea, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the attitude of many subjects and ruling nations was one of accommodation and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 pennies, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each Chinese stage or ruling dynasty was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of unstable fragmented states, the most famous of these being the Three Kingdoms of Han and Jin.
During these periods fierce battles raged between the clergy fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in a struggle for the highest seat in the Xi'an palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from dictatorship to republic, nationalism and the belief that a country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution jobs were open to all male applicants, thus allowing ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
It's the same for soldiers because instead of rank being based on class, it's now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed foreign workers to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this ordinary life. He used to frequent the cave which became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on one of the hills to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is never easy to find, even if one knew of its existence.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it.
The great pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE is one of the largest structures built in honor of deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, or Giza Hill, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the main pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a huge Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper leg mark" looks like a V and the "lower leg mark" like a comma or a square missing its bottom edge.
Top means you should start at the bottom and push the bow, and bottom means you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more stable.
Feel free to pencil in your markings, but remember that printed cursive marks are there for musical purposes, so they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the king's terrified sister Lady Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled toward Paris, surrounded by a cheering crowd that shouted threats at the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their car.
On one occasion a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The military expenditure for U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to finance a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people created a basic income for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th Centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a discourse that encompasses a range of views in practice, from technological determinism, or technological progress to the notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are natural, rather than social.
For example, one might say that cars lead to more roads.
However, the national road system is economically viable for only a few cars, so new production techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the treatment of disfigured bodies.
Rome had much to do with cultural decisions influenced by such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Roman context, geography shaped people, and in the course of time customs and cultures related to geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the social environment, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of aristocratic Europe.
It is known for being a center of luxury that began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its decline during the twelfth century was largely due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices of a higher value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the City of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was influenced by Byzantine customs from the east.
However, because of poor communications, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic system, using locally sourced seeds, combined with crop rotation or simple alternative techniques to improve yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel alienated by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Cultural subgroups may be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, geographic location, and/or gender of the members.
Characteristics that make a subculture unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, geographic, or a combination of elements.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through distinctive styles that include clothing styles, behavior and language.
One of the most popular methods used to illustrate the importance of cooperation is to use a few dramatic examples of children who, through neglect, failure, or deliberate abuse, were excluded from adult involvement as they grew up.
Some abusive children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in other cases the abandonment of the children was due to the parents' denial of a serious mental or physical disability in the child.
Unaccompanied children may have experienced extreme abuse or trauma in their childhood before being released or escaping.
Some are said to be possessed by animals; others are said to live in the wild by themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost exactly like those of a specially cared- for animal, such as its fear or flight from humans.
While project-based education is supposed to make learning easier and more enjoyable, the sting goes a step further.
Learning Methods is not a method of studying but a service that provides support to people who are going through a new learning situation such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Platforms can be virtual as well as physical, in other words, a teacher is a kind of platform but so is that giant piece of paper in Microsoft Office.
Pepe forums are built into the app for the purpose of questioning, persuading, and explaining processes that may have been too challenging for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for many other reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even robbery.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that doesn't educate, doesn't care, doesn't teach, but they do.
We think of the foster care system as a safe place for these children.
Children's homes deserve to provide safe shelter, loving caregivers, solid education, and a reliable health system.
Children's homes are supposed to provide all these needs that were missing in the homes they were previously provided.
The Internet combines elements of both group and individual communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to further measurements of user satisfaction and strategies.
For example, "learning" and "collaboration" are suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal sharing and "sustained relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivating factors when they investigated audience composition on websites.
The use of video recordings has led to an important innovation in subtitling, facial expressions that last a few microseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can tell if someone is lying by interpreting subtle signals accurately.
Oliver Sacks, in his journal The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless capable of accurately evaluating facts.
He even suggests that a similar ability to interpret human behavior could be imparted to animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two categories of genetic variation: hidden and described.
Mutations add genetic differences, and selection removes them from the collection of differences shown.
Changes in isolation donation and recombination back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for large animals with digestive systems like ours to obtain their amino acid needs from the vegetation available
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and finally death.
Easily accessible plant sources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for those of the group of advanced mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (shellfish, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a rich source of protein, which contains essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savanna monkeys do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a quiet alarm clock to rouse you without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting an alarm clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other microbiological options involve heavy drinking (especially of water or tea, a popular remedy) before bedtime, a condition that requires the person to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner calmness that a person has is inversely related to the degree of stress in his body and mind.
The lower the gravity, the more positive the life forces involved. Everyone has the potential for greater peace and contentment.
One thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own anxiety and vulnerability.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. You have Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, repetition of words or sounds and images.
Central to Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga. Through the imagery of various deities the energy pathways are purified, chakras are activated and the consciousness of transformation is awakened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, thus leading to the alliance of the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war the clash of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the country.
And within two years of the war's end, former allies turned enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years and would be fought virtually by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been broken, and the only hope was to return and regroup with the Romanian high command.
These plans, however, became obsolete overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army crossed the Belarusian-Ukrainian border after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo ships were the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods by sea.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country is able to move your people and goods, while at the same time, blocking your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany might conquer Britain as surely as she had conquered Europe.
The domestication of goats probably began about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
In general, domestic goats began to be kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, under the supervision of guardians who were often children or young teenagers, on a par with well-known shepherds.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways loaded logs parallel to the trees, they allowed horses to pull them faster and to haul relatively heavy loads over the rough roads of the day.
However, in time it was discovered that the rails worked better if a metal plate was placed on top of them.
This became the custom, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the chariots to wear out.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-steel railway was put into operation.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, the binadaum began walking upright two million years ago, after the emergence of upright humans.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is common.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs about seven million years ago.
We can start acting like good environmentalists, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future stress to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we do not want just a temporary solution, then we deserve to get to the root of the problem, and we can put it out.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly as a result of man's progress in science and technology, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's extravagant life-styles.
After approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlop Papers".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap fragments known to exist are the oldest copies of the manuscript in existence; the original manuscript is lost.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are programmed to process information that is encoded in binary code.
A binary code can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
A good indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first - aid instructions for the poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in official usage for this group of insects.
The word cockroach is derived from an ancient acquaintance with beetles, which are highly skilled at swallowing humans.
Assassin bugs and Bedbugs are experienced in living in their host's nest or home.
Throughout the Americas, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle - aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of their child, to have custody of the child.
These couples may choose to make a custody plan for their child.
In taking custody, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that other parents can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to determine how the universe will operate by scientific methods. In fact, this method guides much scientific research.
It is not alone however, an experiment, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or two possible theories, ask questions, and make observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on traditional texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all aspects of science were widely accepted, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific origins.
Many followed trends in physiology and behavior that often depend on the existence of natural cycles and their reproduction through biological cycles.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to periodic external signals, have been recorded in many living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals,
Biological clocks are self-regulating oscillators that will maintain a periodicity even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to burn their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to tag DNA in viruses with radioactive phosphorus and viral proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in nature for its recreation and sights, as well as for its flora and fauna.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and reading about ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about the great apes of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to work, passing others who are heading in the same direction.
In this robust mode of transportation, everyone is in some way connected to, and supportive of, the car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has removed the Earth's biosphere from one of its stable states that should have sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar complaints about poor water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems put up with such complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interaction they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to be fairly consistent; thus, traffic jams tend to be fairly stable and can be represented quite accurately statistically.
To represent the flow of traffic accurately, a relationship has been established between three main parameters: (1) flow, (2) weight, and (3) direction.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of intelligent traffic.
The first animals to take to the air were insects, whose ability to soar enabled them to avoid predators and to find food and mates more easily.
Many insects are fortunate enough to be able to fold their wings over their bodies.
This gives them ample opportunity for small hiding places from their enemy.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, along with the Sun (and perhaps other stars).
This seems reasonable, for the earth does not appear to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth, draining eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical quality of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the pyramids of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of many of those who work in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since these can all be found naturally in nature and are easily mined using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and solid, although he also theorized that they evolve into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium tend to be considered metals. In fact there are other metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonferrous elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter - all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a great companion for many people when it appeared.
Sadly, as new writing techniques appear, the pencil is being degraded and used less and less.
People are now typing messages on computer screens, never before without the use of a keyboard.
One might wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
This fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed in the formation of proton- and neutron-rich nuclei.
Like rolling a heavy sled up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei in the sense that they have a tendency to fly apart at the slightest touch.
The moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, with the outermost layer known as the crust.
The earth's surface is about 45 miles [70 km] wide at its base and 60 miles [100 km] wide at the top.
Below the maria they are thin but heavier below the highlands.
There may have been more maria nearby because the shell is thinner.
Content theories aim to find out what keeps people engaged or interested.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become ingrained as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what it is about their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On the one hand, they will try to establish themselves as "one of the guys"" (or women).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels compelled to change everything the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the team as a whole.
Regular teams are held to the same quality standards as regular teams but there are subtle differences.
A team member's email often serves as a point of contact for their current physical team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members as their teams may meet based on different time zones and may be unpredictable to their management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique feature of e-teams.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through a lengthy process to establish a training organization? One goal of putting training organization concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can result.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new creative process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Crowdsourcing approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical perspective on cognitive testing. Thus, it narrows the field of study and makes it more specific.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies enables us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
This gives us a wealth of information and tools to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is mostly associated with scientific jargon, AI forms a very important part of the branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, training and mental modification of machines.
Research in AI involves designing machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behaviors to be automated.
Examples include control, planning and coordination, cognitive response capabilities and customer inquiries, as well as text, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, hoping to provide solutions to life's problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as built into a number of home computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Often the teacher likes to take his students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of anonymous field trips. Students can look at artifacts in museums, visit tangisamaki, or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Participating together in a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future travelers.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is updated, but older versions remain online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also enhance student writing. While students start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling problems, the presence of a general audience changes that.
Since students are the most important audience, the blogger starts working on improving the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to satisfy an audience's curiosity motivates students to be smart and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to expand their reading beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more critical and critical; by responding appropriately to Internet material, students can place themselves in the context of others' writings as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's most colorful and bilingual city, with numerous art galleries and museums that tell the story of Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the undiscovered beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these and more characterize Ontario as it is taken for granted as Canadian by outsiders.
The vast expanses in the far north are sparsely populated and partly desert.
For a startling demographic comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as a self-governing continent, the extent of its wildlife is in question.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the area, and it profoundly influenced Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
It is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that any female travellers declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also important to wear a ring (not an expensive-looking one).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in saying no to people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, they don't make them equal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and a whole range of geegaws, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of Congo located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be checked to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the easiest tracking of Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. A typical fare for locals is 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Despite its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to serve as a metaphor for distant foreign lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its fame makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stations during Henry Louis Gates' African Wonders of the World PBS special.
The city is in a difficult comparison with other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Mamba River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's top tourist attractions and is considered the premier of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all National Parks in South Africa, there is a daily fee for conservation and admission.
It may be beneficial for one to purchase a National Parks Card, which grants admission to some or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a major tourist attraction.
Hong Kong's towering skyscrapers are paired with a colorful bar chart likely inspired by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is where the English colonists took up residence and so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial era, this is a good place to start.
The Sandabani are the world's largest coastal mangroves, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian mainland.
The Sandarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A section of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sandarbans National Park.
These are not just swamp mangroves - they include some of the last remnants of the dense forest that once covered the Gaengitiki plateau.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, of which one third is covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966 the Sandaban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave from the central bus station of Malaya (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coast Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable form of travel in nearby areas, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The twin towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], are 1,200 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes each 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as nomadic hunter-gatherers who also cultivated subsistence crops.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally known as the "Giant of the Province of the Indies", was born as a result of clashes between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve its distinct identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest championship of the year will be held in December at the polo grounds in Las Kanitas.
Major and minor championships can also be viewed from here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British or American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are acceptable.
It is not possible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Plateau is cold and vice versa.
Montevideo is located on the subtropical side; in the summer months, temperatures of over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are not unusual.
Winter can be treacherously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "wet" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the wild have become accustomed to humans, predators are still wild animals, and they do not deserve to be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful they may be, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals are vulnerable to attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All but one of the British ships were sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peace conference in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the bustling population of Auckland's two harbours.
The North Coast beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many are shaded by mangroves.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxury areas of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with rows of shops along the shore.
The main beer in the area is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but good and comforting. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many varieties of French wine available, but New Zealand and Australian wines fare better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are nervous.
To Australians, the idea of 'white' coffee is foreign - the short black is "espresso", the cappuccino comes with more buttermilk (not foam) and the tea is prepared without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and fruit juices are expensive but of good quality.
Most rock climbing trips are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the rock are rare.
Still, take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Sea cucumbers appear near the coast and near estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770' s. They may occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are shy and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles rarely live in the sea, their main habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives.
Travel agencies often have deals with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agency companies typically offer package deals that include breakfast, transportation plans to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also make a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some concerts, large numbers of concertgoers decide to camp out on the grounds, and many of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to fly early to find a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even after the music on the main stage has ended, there may be some concerts that continue late into the night.
Several festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the shelter area, as walking in snow creates an unpleasant noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include city time. These passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money and time spent by gamblers. Windows and clocks are usually missing, and exits are hard to find.
Special food, drinks, and entertainment are often provided to entertain guests and to keep them entertained on the premises.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who will be driving over steep terrain or mountain passes needs to be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, and bitter cold.
On icy and snow - covered roads, friction is low and driving is as difficult as on unpaved roads.
During a deep freeze, enough ice may fall for a short time to freeze you to death.
Visibility can also be obstructed by falling or accumulating snow or by ice or frost on car windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy environments are common in many nations, and transportation runs smoothly year - round.
Perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the focus of most visitors is the safari.
The word safari refers to traveling to see Africa's amazing wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move closer to vehicles, and simple equipment will allow better observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen under a microscope.
Hiking (known as "jungle walking", "climbing", or "walking") involves climbing, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city ever to host two summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not go into effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing about ¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be rented, even when no one is in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, then you might try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the cloth (as this can cause splashing, or in the worst case, burns).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places one minute of boiling water is sufficient, in others several minutes will be needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you may want to consider buying your water in tightly sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter insect pests that are unfamiliar to them from their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in extreme cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as pets.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without paying duty and taxes in some areas.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently traverses through secluded forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves abound.
The posted speed limits are much lower than those of the leading and trailing sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and strict adherence to them is therefore more important than others.
Surprisingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than in other road networks like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are excellent, and in Bavaria, they are superior and varied, as is that of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with baked apples served as pies year-round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Almonds, walnuts, and peanuts make up the bulk of German baked goods.
If you want small but tasty snacks, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Celery is a food made from herbs and spices, as well as meat or vegetables.
Basil can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in a spicy sauce; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With some 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catchall term for the wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualifiers, the word most likely refers to a dish that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
A staple food in the vast areas of the archipelago is simple Javanese cuisine, the basic ingredients of which are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
Handrails are poles that support the operator's feet and that hang down on either side of the bed.
They give the rider great stability but can be a safety concern because of the ability of the rider's legs to get caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear high-top, smooth, very thin boots, the soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather to be pulled down into the saddle as if being pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - a major climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite and boulder walls.
The summits provide breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continue to blaze new trails through its formidable walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity, with many participants, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning an entire vacation to ski in a particular area.
The idea of snowboarding is very old - cave paintings depict snowboarders as far back as 5000 BC!
The sport of speed skating dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ice-skating club was established by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski touring.
It is related to but usually not associated with alpine ski tours or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring boards and sturdy boots.
Think of a ski trail as an analogy for a climbing route.
Under ideal conditions you will be able to cover relatively greater distances than walking - but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without heavy shunting on previously traveled routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent made up of many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and go through passport control frequently.
The Schengen area, however, operates more or less as one country in this respect.
Better stay in this area, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Also, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique manufactured item. Some customs agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Art objects can be described as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Arctic reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
However, traditionally, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and reared reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern industries, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
Although widely used, and controversial among non-Roma, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with prejudice and negative attitudes toward Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes a subject for travel advice, your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to consult the government's advice rather than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
