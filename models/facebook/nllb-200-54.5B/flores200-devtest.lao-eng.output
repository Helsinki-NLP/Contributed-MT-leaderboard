This widely publicized theory not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but fails to provide general details of the fossil such as details on color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the insect's plumage is a pale blue on the upper surface or a buoyant carotene on the underside.
It also gives us a deep insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur scales did not have scales or well-developed scales, but had other features of scales - thickness and stripes - the researchers suggested that scales were likely a late evolutionary development to these scales.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers for a full-grown male and not a chick.
Critics have suggested that, although this may be the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen suggests that the giant squid was not a chicken.

Much of the work was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the constellation of Sagittarius.
The effect the team is looking for could be caused by the gravitational attraction between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the rising moon pulls on the Earth's surface, causing water to rise and fall, so the Milky Way pulls on the Sagittarius constellation.
Scientists can infer that dark matter affects other dark matter in the universe just as other matter does.
This theory says that the darkest matter in the universe is located around the universe in the form of galaxies and is made of very small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally done this way: eligible voters isolate themselves in a ballot box, place a printed sheet of paper that has passed their choice of candidate into a mailbox.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the eligible voter places a stamp in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law tends to prescribe a very strict electoral procedure.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that election officials and observers can testify that there were no mailboxes in the box at the beginning of voting and that no mailboxes were filled other than those of the already counted and certified voters.
Candidates can send representatives to testify in all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under the strict supervision of a procedural moderator.

The leaked document refers to a border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is mutually respectful, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a ten-year military presence on the mountain when the agreement was signed, while the PA agreed to leave after only five years.
The shooters in the pest control experiment are to be monitored more closely by the forest officials due to the monitoring of the experiment and evaluation of its effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the National Rifle Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are enrolled under the NRA's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn who holds the position of Director of Cultural Preservation with the NPWS, the four athletes selected for the first shoot received safety instructions and supervised training.
Martelly was sworn in by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It was Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Electoral Commission clarified its earlier acceptance of the CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to anti-regime protests that began in early October.
Occasionally violent protests are caused by the failure to hold elections, which may have occurred as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of abnormal operation of an overheated iPod were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said there had been 27 accidents involving such devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified 34 additional heat-related incidents that the company still considered "not serious".
The ministry responded to reports of Apple's postponement as "really disappointing".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am, local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Philippine police officer holds a tourist hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early due to being Filipino photographers.
The photographer then substituted a woman's seat for his while he needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as a surgeon and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he worked at the Liggins Hospital, he began researching preeclampsia in his spare time.
His research has shown that if the hormone is injected it will help accelerate lung growth in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The boxer also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was my first queen of perfection, my first manager. Luna died on a night when the sun had two suns with the same identity as him, both strong women".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented "Luna is as weird as I am...maybe even more...I love him and will miss him...hope he goes to a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Austria becoming a republic had increased by eight percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed shared the view that they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In a recent poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100 metres and 200 metres and in the relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints cast doubt on his fitness.
He was unable to take drugs to overcome his knee pain because they were banned from the game.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was published on Tuesday.
Mars may have provided Earth with water as well as enzymes that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how asteroids form, especially how planets form since asteroids collided with planets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to assume the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will provide aircraft with shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to traditional ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft in detail and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional special transport and the underground runs non-stop to Wembley and there is no parking or public transport available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played indoors without team supporters.
Research published in the journal Science on Thursday reports the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the genome has evolved in only two generations, although this process is expected to take a long time due to crossbreeding between the Darwin's guinea pig, Geospiza leafmineralis, and the dry bark beetle, Conirostris Geospiza.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be bent into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into certain lines, which can be twisted and punched, and it can also be punched or rolled into sheets.
It can be cut and pasted onto other metals. It can even sometimes be decorated with drawings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called the pH of a chemical.
Vegetable juices change color depending on whether they are acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
When dry, the two halves are mixed and kneaded with clean hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the surface, which feels strange and forms a kind of skin.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had running water in almost every house, along with sophisticated sewage systems.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There are also ancient Egyptian, Persian and Chinese baths. In Roman architecture, baths were sometimes part of public baths that men and women used together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, that means you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then reflects it back immediately.
Satellites are launched into space with probes, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of our light and our vision.
It would have to be a giant balloon more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done is to make transportation much easier and much faster.
It brought us trains, cars, and lots of other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized primates that eat medium-sized grasses ranging from ferns to mosses and lichens.
Finally, there are many small cats (including extinct domestic cats) that feed on a large number of small herbivores such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the cone, which is the special thing each cat believes must keep it from competing with other cats.
Lions are gregarious cats, living in large groups known as prides.
A pride consists of one to three related genera, including the mother and up to thirty more young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, in large families of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of a pride of lions is similar to that of a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, but surprisingly, animals that behave like lions (but not great apes) are also prey for them.
Like an all-round athlete, they can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far and have five times the gravity of a strong human.
Cats are in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, tigers, and leopards.
And the sound they made was like that of a lion roaring. The sound they made was like that of harpists playing their harps.
Wolves like to eat small animals. They will catch lions, snakes, mice and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that wolves prey on are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think cats track and find prey by scent, sniffing out where they've been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and are also stealthy. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then jumping onto the prey.
When small groups of organisms (with small populations) become isolated from the main populations they came from (such as if they move to mountains or rivers or if they move to new islands from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a much different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has both different resources and competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they previously needed.
Indigenous populations have not changed at all, they still need to adapt.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process reproduction, which means the creation of new species. Reproduction is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe, and they produce carbon dioxide for humans to exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat mostly plants, so without plants, animals can't survive.
Mosasaurus was the best hunter of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with more than 70 serrated teeth, plus a special set in its jaw, meaning there is no way to escape when stepping across its path.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a serpent tongue. Its diet included crabs, large fish, and other molluscs, and it may have eaten humans.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex couldn't match it.
While much of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans' share of strange or unusual treats included: wild boar, birds, lizards and a species of rat called the dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their meals at ordinary tables, the rich man often holds a communal banquet by sitting down to eat with a reserved seat for his guest.
Ancient Roman cuisine was not included in the cuisines that came from the Americas or from Asia to Europe during the later part of the century.
For example, they didn't have onions, carrots, French fries, chocolate, and none of the ancient Romans ate chicken.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which they considered the home of the gods.
People would offer sacrifices to various gods, and the priests would try to please those gods through rituals and festivals.
A high priest entered the inner room, which was called the Most Holy Place.
Sometimes pyramids with special towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
And above was the oracle of the house, the most holy place.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place in the open.
The women cooked in the fields; the shops were just open tables facing the street; the stones were used to build houses.
There was not much wood left in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was settled sporadically. In Norse mythology they say Erik the Red was banished from Iceland because of the murder and on his journey further west found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But if you ignore his discovery, the Eskimos were already well established there at that time.
Although within each country there are "Scandinavians", there are many differences between the people, kings, traditions and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever looked at a National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the back of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early days, documents written on large sheets of paper (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) were folded for storage.
Thus, it is possible that the mark was added in the form of a symbol.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south remained largely unfree.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French Forces fought to liberate southern France and turn back Germany in just two weeks.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together: society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and thus defines the size of a society.
The city-state is the ancestor of nations. A civilization refers to the transmission of knowledge across generations, the lasting and fairly widespread vestiges of a culture.
Minor subcultures often disappear by discarding relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as valid civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak federal government - of which Congress was the sole element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to tax, and because it has no national executive or judicial branch, it relies on state governments, which often do not cooperate, to enforce its laws.
It also does not have the power to repeal tax laws and interstate tax rates.
The bill required unanimous consent from all states before it could be amended, and states were beholden to the federal government because their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, along with Germany, having qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice skating, roller skating and F1 racing.
Winter sports are so popular in the north that Italians have included them in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Because Japan is a collection of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "island".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the East India Company based in southwestern Taiwan began a shift away from traditional rice production and hired Chinese laborers to work its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki by which it ceded sovereignty over northern Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures named Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun and Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the intricate buildings have been reconstructed to give visitors a first-hand look at how they came to be.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored and pilgrimages continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format during the late motion picture era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proportions have been inherited by the image sensor models of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is the actual format, but it is also confused with, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Ratios of this form (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) are therefore said to be equal to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-C format) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been much misused and often ridiculed, is a simple idea that builds strength as well as maintains the order of an image.
It states that the optimal placement of the main object in an image is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal triangles (see in the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become extremely wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity held Europe together despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
Its contagious power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the central Christian beliefs was that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, so church coffers existed specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for thousands of years, and the concentration of power and money led many to question whether this theory had been discovered.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, the British began blocking German naval communications.
The strategy was enforced by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade was a violation of generally accepted international law that had been enshrined in numerous international treaties over the previous two centuries.
The United Kingdom dredged international waters to prevent submarines from entering any part of the ocean that could pose a threat to anything, including civilian ships.
Because of the limited response to such a mechanism, Germany hoped for a response similar to unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant ideologies of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, many nations were eager to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China was unique in that each Chinese era or dynasty was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty was an uncertain period of divided provinces. The best-known period is the Three Kingdoms period that occurred for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these times, fierce wars took place between many noble families who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for supremacy in the Great Wall of Xi'an.
The social and political implications were many, such as the adoption of a numeral system, the transition from autocratic leadership to democratic republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to individuals.
Also, after the Career Revolution, it was an opportunity for all male participants who were the most ambitious and accomplished to advance.
Same for the military, because instead of ranking troops based on class, they now rank them based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to rise up in their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He frequently went to the cave which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) for meditation.
He entered the cave himself, which survived, giving a much clearer picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Resting on a hill north of Mecca, the valley is cut off from the rest of the world.
It's actually not that easy to find, even if you know it's there.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to mourn the death of a pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small cemeteries, several pyramids and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khuf and numerous smaller pyramids, temples and tombs were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bow up" mark resembles a V and the "bow down" mark resembles a square without a bottom.
That means you should start at the tip and pull the lever and turn down means you should start at the crook (which is where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow usually produces a stronger and more aggressive sound.
Don't feel embarrassed to get your own labels, but remember that the brackets printed there are for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The dashing King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and his sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of women merchants.
The carriage in which they were travelling back to Paris was surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The rioting crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
There was a scene where an unarmed member who was the head of the royal guard was brutally murdered at Versailles in front of the queen.
The cost of the American Empire's war to defeat the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to offset the principal and interest payments on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits from the Filipino people's heroic exploitation created fundamental benefits for the U.S. empire.
To understand the Templars, we have to understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which these events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the High Middle Ages, which peaked around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide variety of ideas in practice ranging from technological imperatives or technological necessity to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying necessity involving scientific laws and technological manifestations.
Most definitions of technology share two general concepts: the development of technology itself along lines largely beyond cultural or political influence, and technology in turn having an "impact" on society as an entity rather than as a social condition.
For example, one could say that cars are an inevitable cause of road development.
However, a nationwide road network was not economically feasible with only a few cars, so new manufacturing methods were developed to reduce the capital cost of car ownership.
Car ownership has also led to an increase in higher accident rates on the road which has led to the innovation of new hygienic techniques to repair damaged car parts.
Romanticism was an important component of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, landscapes shaped individuals, and over time traditions and cultures associated with geography emerged, and these, in turn, corresponded to places in society, rather than laws dictated by reason.
In the same way that Paris is known for being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople is credited for being the famous European fashion capital.
It was famous for being a center of luxury, which started around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the name of the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style was at the height of its popularity between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
The beginning of the decoration was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow communication channels the Western model may be 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest developments at the time was as a result of the Crusades that people started to use buttons to tear clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is natural, often organic farming that uses genetics harvested from nature in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be divided by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define different subcultures may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultural groups often signal their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic traits, which include group-specific fashions, behaviors, and vocabulary.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of social adaptation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, having gone through deliberate neglect, cruelty or abuse, were not taken into adult society as they were growing up.
Such children have been referred to as "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to the parents' denial of the child's severe mental or physical disabilities.
Bad children may have experienced child abuse or extreme pain before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to live by nature itself.
When raised by a non-human primate, a feral child will exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost like an animal in specific care such as fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, there is an upgrade to go one step further.
Sitting is not a method of learning, but rather a supportive aid for individuals who are having a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Chairs can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is making a chair but it's made from a small sheet of paper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are contained within software and are intended to pose questions, speed up and explain procedures that may be challenging for students to handle alone.
Children are sent to orphanages for a variety of reasons which include neglect, abuse and even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't give them attention, care and education, but they do.
We recognize that the primary care system is a safe space for these children.
Our primary care system is supposed to provide safe housing, loving caregivers, reliable education and reliable health care.
Primary care is expected to provide all the necessities that are lacking in the home they were previously given.
The Internet incorporates elements of both mass media and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive nature of the Internet has led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and in content.
For example, "learning" and "social" have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal relevance" and "continuous interaction" were also identified as key to creating new motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they surveyed audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to test whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the meaning of the particles.
Oliver Sacks in his article on presidential speeches points out how people are unable to understand speech due to concussion but are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He also pointed out that such an ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation and selection removes it from the group of clear mutations.
Separation and compact integration go back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for animals with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: a poorer world, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the readily available protein in leafy vegetables and legumes, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (meat, poultry, eggs) are not only easily digested but they also yield large amounts of protein which contains all the essential amino acids.
Everything is assuming that we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep period and going back to sleep for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without making you fully awake.
If you find that you like to set a new clock in your bedroom, you can place it on the other side of the room to force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-related options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, also known as herbal tea) before going to bed, forcing the body to wake up.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is related to the amount of hatred in one's body and mind.
It is good for the soul to rest a little, for it is a tree of life to those who find peace and joy in their toil.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own shame and self-rejection.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but expanded upon the noble path of love and with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation practice and the path of loving-kindness.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the power of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, meditation and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By creating images of deities that allow for the flow of pure energy, the chakras are activated and there is the creation of consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the former Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures separated the countries.
By the time the war ended two years later, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought virtually by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been destroyed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian border.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army arrived and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian Front after the invasion of eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's long-standing mission is to ensure that your nation can maintain a stable flow of people and goods, while also interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic convoys of World War II. The Americans attempted to move men and material across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy used large U-boats to try to stop this traffic.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany might still be able to defeat England since it still had the rest of continental Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domestic goats are generally kept in herds that roam the mountains or other grazing areas, the herds are often raised by children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known sheep herders. These farming methods are still used today.
Roundabouts were invented in England in the early 16th century.
Although horse-drawn carts were composed of planks of wood, they allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and to pull larger loads on less busy roads each day.
The expedition was introduced too early to go according to plan. It was clear, however, that a slow pursuit would be more effective if there was iron at the top.
This became a common practice, but steel caused more and more wooden wheels to be put on the wheel.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767 the first fully iron locomotive was introduced.
The earliest known communication was walking. Humans began walking on two legs two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning erect man).
Their early ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Expertise in bipedalism is found in the remains of Australopithecus dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living green, we can join the environmental movement, and we can be activists to reduce the desirability of the future to some extent.
This is the same for treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and we should stop working on them.
It's clear that the world has changed a lot because of human scientific and technological progress, and the problems have gotten worse because of human over-consumption and over-indulgence.
After passage by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were built, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
First public reading of the document by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five attacks on Dunlap are known to survive in the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript is no longer extant.
Today, many paleontologists and botanists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to the present day.
A lot of people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that remain the same as dinosaurs.
They have spindly, muscular legs, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the management of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can have only one of two values: 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
The poison inside may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as sore throat are common symptoms that cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicine containers or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The term hard tick is used informally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with dragonflies, which are insects highly adapted to mating with humans.
Both insects and amphibians are colorless, adapted to their burrowing habitats.
Across the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), considered the leading neurological disease that occurs in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis (MS).
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the interests of their children to have children.
These couples may choose to plan for surrogacy for their child.
In a surrogacy arrangement, the biological parent gives up custody of the child to the other parent.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It is not the only one. Experiments and experiments are tests that use one or more possible hypothesis constraints. Asking questions and observing are also methods of scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Acceptance was Aristotle's view on all matters of science including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, Westerners found themselves cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Much of the observed anxiety in physiology and behavior is dependent on the emergence of an external cycle and its production through the biological clock.
Transient stimuli that do not readily respond to external stimuli have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining device that will continue its independent circadian rhythm even in the absence of an external signal.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria-eating viruses or viruses to embed their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to tag DNA in phages with high-energy phosphorus or phage proteins with high-energy phosphors.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cell is a cell wall.
Only mutations in the cell wall can spread to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people to visit natural areas for the purpose of experiencing beautiful scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
Examples of places to visit, photograph and learn about in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside by car to go to their workplaces and cross paths with others whose workplace destination is where they left off.
In this mobility delivery van, everyone is connected and supports a car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that a carbon-intensive economy drove life out of one of the stable states that had fostered human evolution for the past two million years.
Everybody in society who uses transportation, almost everybody criticizes transportation.
In the developed world, you don't hear complaints about water quality at neighborhood level or broken bridges.
Why are there such complaints about transit systems, why do they fail every day? Are transit engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because driver behavior is not one hundred percent predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent limits. Thus, the flow of traffic tends to be reasonably consistent and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships are established between three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These interactions help in the planning, design and operation of amenities on the street.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have a comparative advantage in propelling their wings upwards.
This alone gives them a small, open area to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't get rid of them are moths and ants.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some think he is right, but many believe the opposite, that the solar system moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars as well).
This seems to make sense because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows out of the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The mainstream Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never exceeded their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians marveled at their ancestors' palaces that were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the most sparsely populated.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian was also the language used in everyday life by most people working in the state, while Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the elemental metals such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, and these can be found in nature in traditional forms and easily extracted with traditional tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements. They are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is analogous to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and liquid, so much so that he even theorized that they could be transformed into new matter to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
So black was a good friend of many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing systems emerged, black letters were left in less prominence and less use.
People are typing on computer screens now, never near a printer.
One only wonders what will happen to the printing press when something new comes along.
A fusion bomb works on the principle of using the energy from the fusion of a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
Similar to driving a heavy car up a hill, the nucleus comes out again and releases some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to separate with little or no gravity.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner in low-lying areas and thicker at higher elevations.
There may be more volcanic rocks near the edges because the Earth's crust is thinner.
Context theories are central to figuring out what makes people attractive or interesting to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that change as they grow older.
These theories look at what it is about a particular person that causes them to want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues. One is the tendency to keep being "one of those guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, operating in a disciplined manner, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the frequency spectrum, one shifts into an unforgettable personality who feels he has to change everything the team does and make it his own.
Ultimately, a leader needs to take responsibility for their team's success and failure.
This behavior often creates a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual team is elevated to the same level of excellence as the real team, but it's a little bit different.
Real team members act as points of contact for their physical group.
They will usually have more autonomy than the average team member since their team may meet in different time zones which their local manager may not understand.
The appearance of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why do organizations need to go through the time-consuming process of establishing learning organizations? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can flourish.
And then the result, the process of organizations working together to overcome obstacles can lead to improved processes to serve customer needs.
Before organizations can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as organizational knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of operational efficiency.
Neuroinformatics provides a physical basis for theoretical approaches to cognitive inquiry. It thus narrows the research field and makes it more specific.
The relationship between neurological diseases and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain trauma, injuries, wounds and contusions affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and examine structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This has given us a lot of data and material to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) tends to make great sense in science fiction, AI has become a very important branch of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Research on AI involves building machines for automating tasks that require intelligent operations.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, while responsiveness to customer needs and queries includes hand, voice, and facial recognition.
These things became separate disciplines that focused on solving real-life problems.
AI systems currently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military are built into many home computers and video game software programs.
Educational theory is an important part of every class. Teachers often like to take students to places where a bus is not an option.
The technology offers a way to solve problems by simulating a real field trip. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing virtual learning perspectives is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with a strange interface and clicks, the general public's view changes that.
Since students are the most important target audience, bloggers began to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Bloggers "also push students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to respond to readers' interests motivates intelligent and attentive students (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and motivates students to extend good learning beyond the regular school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by responding to Internet devices realistically, students can determine their own position in relation to others' writing as well as formulate their own perspective on a particular issue" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant city, a bilingual capital and home to art galleries, museums and exhibitions that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls, and farther north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario as what is considered by outsiders to be the heart of Canada.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and in some places deserted.
For a very surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest city, and it's its own continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to various lands and spread it widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is advantageous to wear rings as well, only the rings seem too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they perceive as rape and it is not uncommon to follow suit, such as being grabbed on the arm and so on.
Be firm in rejecting the man and don't be afraid to take his point of view (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber merchants in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
Moroccan religious leaders rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, paper goods, hookahs and glasses of all kinds, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which washed away much of the streets in the city, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, visits outside the city of Goma should be explored to understand the still persistent fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The town is also a place to climb the Nyiragongo volcano as well as the cheapest mountain gorilla trail in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (hired motorbike) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 CFA for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for a strange, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame has made it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during the filming of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from other cities in the country because it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-friendly zones that each support different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and it is also considered a key site of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a maintenance fee and a daily entrance fee like other South African national parks.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to the park of your choice in South Africa and all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island has made Hong Kong famous and is a place that many tourists consider as a main attraction.
The tilting of the skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a landscape created by the emergence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon on the opposite shore.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
These are British colonial sites that have taken on a life of their own and so if you're looking for evidence of colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching up to 80 kilometres (50 mi) into Bangladesh and rural India far from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest within the territory of India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just ponds - they include some of the last remnants of this vast forest which once controlled the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans National Park has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 leopards in the area.
Buses leave the inter-city (cross-river) bus station throughout the day, most notably eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang departures between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are usually full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most cities are served by small Japanese buses which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two-story building is 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and it has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical distance from the camera to the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to officially open in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are a major indigenous group currently living in eastern Paraguay, living as hunter-gatherers who practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá who make their living by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In 16th-century Paraguay the formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies" was born as a result of the Spanish defeat's encounter with indigenous tribes.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best football teams and the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Estadio Paulista in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions and tournaments can be seen here at various times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards on remote islands may not be accepted, although British and US currencies may be used; check with the owner in advance to determine acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the humid tropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30 degrees are common.
Winters can be incredibly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no specific "wet" and "dry" season: the amount of precipitation falls at the same level throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used for wildlife viewing by humans, wildlife should not be kept and tamed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all wildlife!
No matter how fearsome they may seem, tigers, leopards and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep the proper distance. There are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors will attract snakes and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the interior clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an embarrassing maritime dispute in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. More than 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the time of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's two parallel harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the town of North Harbor) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas and protected by mangroves.
Tamaki Drive is on the Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes densely populated family beaches with many shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The famous local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer but it is fun and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are very good and should be, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better.
The local well water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you feel scared, bottled water is also readily available.
For Australians, the concept of "black coffee" is foreign. Black is "espresso", cappuccino comes with cream (in the front) and tea is unsweetened.
Hot chocolate is made to Banksy's standards. Juice is expensive but delicious.
Expeditions to the equator occur year-round, and injuries from the equator are rare.
Stop first, follow instructions from authorities, obey all traffic signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occurred near sandbars and near lakes from October to April in the north in 1770. They can sometimes be found at outdoor bars at this time.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most fish will be afraid of humans and run away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will be staying somewhere when they arrive at their destination.
Tour companies often have deals on specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a tour company.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even a combination of airline and hotel packages.
They can book you in if you need time to think about the offer or can arrange documentation for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any corrections or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals the majority of music festival attendees decide to camp and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get closer to the concert you will have to enter in advance to get a campsite closer to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage may have ended, there may be some parts of the show that will continue to play until the end.
Some festivals have special area camps for families with children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the passenger cabin as the force through the ice makes a frightening noise for those most affected.
Cruise ships in Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize time and expense from guests. Windows and clocks are usually unusable and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to make guests feel good and to keep them in the accommodation.
Some places have alcoholic beverages. However, getting drunk is a bad decision and all gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very cold temperatures.
The roads are cold and snowy, the humidity is low, and you can't drive like you're on a grapevine.
During a blizzard, enough snow to keep you trapped is less likely to fall.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or sleet or ice on a car window.
Conversely, cold and snowy weather is common in many countries, and most traffic moves regularly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
The more colloquial term safari refers to a scenic tour of African wildlife, especially in the Savanna.
Some animals, such as lions and deer, are more likely to approach vehicles and standard equipment will provide a better view.
Lions, tigers and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with a telescope.
A safari (also known as a "hike", "climbing safari" or "walking tour") consists of climbing a mountain, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the Olympics in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may be in for a shock.
Cancellation policies varied but by the end of March, most coronavirus-induced cancellations would not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most admission tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have dishwashers and stoves available for rinsing, even if not in the room.
If you don't have a towel or you don't have clean socks, you can use a hair dryer, if you have one.
Care should be taken not to overheat the fabric (as this will cause it to rust or in a worse case the fabric may burn).
There are many different ways to purify water, some more effective than others against specific hazards.
In some areas boiling water for about a minute is sufficient, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness and should be a concern, so you should consider purchasing pre-sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter pests that they would never encounter in their native areas.
Pests can cause food spoilage, spread disease or in extreme cases cause symptoms, spread poisoning or transmit infection.
Infectious or zoonotic diseases that can cause illness or death are not usually considered pandemics.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and fees in some places.
Tourists who travel to countries with sometimes high taxation can save a lot of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway through frequent commutes in the deserted hills.
If you have never driven on rural roads, beware of steep, narrow and winding roads.
Announced speed limits are lower than in previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance is more important.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is also better than many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
The German dialects are quite good and in Bavaria are quite numerous and diverse similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apple-based cakes available year-round and cherry and plum-based cakes appearing during the summer.
Many German pastries often contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular pastries often go well with strong coffee.
If you want a spicy pastry, you must try the locally named Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A stew is a dish made of spices and seasonings, with either meat or vegetables.
Wood pellets can be either ""dry"" or ""boiled"" depending on the volume of liquid.
In the northern regions of India and Pakistan, coconut milk is generally used in curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used in curries.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a term that covers the variety of indigenous foods found throughout the country.
However, if used without further specification, the term tends to imply that the traditional cuisine comes from central and eastern Java.
Now widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by simple seasonal decorations. The most prominent dishes that Javanese people enjoy are groundnuts, bananas, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar) and various spicy condiments.
The foot pegs are the driver's foot pegs placed on either side of the axle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the rider's willingness to stick to them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but the legs are restrained while riding, they will be dragged away if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear flat-soled, relatively narrow, floor-to-ceiling boots.
Additionally, some saddles, particularly British saddles, have a safety bar that allows the footpads to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider.
Cochamó Mountains - Chilean mountaineering destination, known as the Yosemite of South America for its variety of walls and boulders.
Climbers from all parts of the world are constantly forging new routes among the endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist attraction with a large number of people, sometimes called "ski bums", planning a skiing holiday at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It involves but is not usually associated with downhill ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on slopes and requiring sturdy ski boots and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover longer distances than walking - but there is very little you can do at cross-country ski speeds without a heavy make-up bag.
Europe is a small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries means having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Area, however, operates like any of these countries.
If you are still in the area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similar to having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa with each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There are no international restrictions on the classification of manufactured items as antiques. Some customs services classify items more than 100 years old as antiques.
Such an interpretation leads to a geological variation in which the lifespan may be shorter in places, such as in North America than in Europe.
Artifacts may be classified as antiquities, even if they are younger than many manufactured items.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation in the Sámi and surrounding cultures, commercially important for many professions as well.
Traditionally, although not all Sámi were involved in rearing large reindeer, they lived from fishing, hunting and other nearby activities. Most reindeer are raised as pack animals.
Today many Sámi work in the modern commercial sector. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, which is in the Sámi region.
Although it is widely used especially among non-Romani groups, the term "gypsy" is often considered derogatory due to negative associations and misperceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is under a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation coverage may be affected.
You may want to consult government guidelines in addition to your own, but their guidelines are designed for their citizens.
An American citizen in the Middle East, for example, may face a different situation than a European or Arab.
News releases are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are presented in a way that is vague, general, and exaggerated compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena that may cause damage, extreme social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are many different types depending on the landscape, the mountains and the climate.
