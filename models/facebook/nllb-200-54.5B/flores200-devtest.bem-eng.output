This not only confirms that some of these monkeys had feathers, a widespread myth, but also provides clues that the fossil record cannot, such as the color and appearance of the animals.
Scientists described the creature as having a shaggy upper body and a protruding lower jaw.
This research also sheds light on the evolution of feathers.
Because the baleen whale's feathers do not have a well-defined rachis, but have other hairlike structures - branches and bones - the researchers concluded that the rachis was more developed than the other parts.
The design of the feathers suggests that they were used, not for flight, but for warmth and for display. The researchers found that although the tail of the sperm whale is reduced in size, this feature reveals the upper feathers of the adult and not the tail of the juvenile.
The researchers found that although the tail is that of a juvenile, the pattern reveals the adult's outer coat and not the juvenile's.

According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "the media did not realise how dangerous it was to publish more photographs of criminals".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which handles all criminal trials, has told the press that no further comment will be made until the case is heard.
The document, according to the release, will address the border dispute, which the Palestinians claim is based on borders from the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed included Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after the negotiations are signed and the PA agrees to withdraw for only five years.
Victims of experiments to increase pest control were closely monitored by the park ranger, as the experiments were monitored and their effectiveness reviewed.
In a partnership between the NPSW and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., trained volunteers were put to work, under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Park Conservation and Heritage and NPWS, the four shooters selected in the first round received extensive safety training.
Martelly has inaugurated and sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with free elections.
The CEP will be Martelly's party in four years.
Last month the presidential administration ordered the CEP to suspend operations as part of steps to bring the country closer to new elections.
The movement was a response to widespread anti-government protests that began in the month of August.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections since 2011.
Up to 60 iPods were reportedly malfunctioning and overheating, causing fires in six locations and leaving four people with minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says that it has received reports of 27 nuclear accidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 other serious incidents, which it called "minor".
The segment responded by calling Apple's exit "deeply disappointing".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 p.m. GMT on Friday)
The Mariana Islands disaster management office reported that no deer were harmed.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that there was no indication that the waves would reach land.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he seized a sacha they were carrying in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 Rifle at the tourists.
Most of the hostages were rescued and six are now presumed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later captured an elderly woman attempting to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician and joined Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching the cause of childbirth in his spare time.
His research showed that hormone therapy could increase the rate of lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the two "black boxes" of the plane on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers are also mourning.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager Luna passed away at midnight two months ago. As unique as I am. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as special as I was... I hope she was in the right place".
Of the 1,400 voters who cast ballots in the 2010 federal election, the number who rejected open government was 8 percent higher than in 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled felt the same way, favoring Queen Elizabeth II as Australia's last monarch.
On polling day, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a colony as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that the country should never become a colony.
The gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m sprints and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but withdrew after complaining of discomfort.
He was unable to take painkillers because they were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has found the largest number I can divide by today, January 25.
The discovery was confirmed by multiple sources in early April and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the means by which water and other organic materials that can form life-sustaining proteins are brought to the earth.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of the planets, especially the formation of the Earth, from the collisions of comets in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors of "political correctness and hypocrisy".
He was considering running in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a type of system that the FAA says could allow aircraft to fly shorter distances while saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to see each aircraft in its entirety and to give pilots more accurate information.
There are no additional services and no underground trains stop at Wembley, and car parks and driveways are not served by the underground.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised concerns that the games will be forced to take place indoors without the support of spectators.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorean Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden say that the evolution of a new species took only two generations, although it was believed to be a long process, thanks to a cross between the Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into a variety of shapes and sizes.
It can be wrapped around a long cord, rolled and unrolled, and wrapped or folded in a sheet.
It could be made into ornaments, glued onto other metals, and so highly decorated that it was sometimes used to adorn the illustrations in illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance, such as red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the solution.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the sample.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Using clean hands, knead the dough until it reaches the desired consistency.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer of skin, creating a pleasant texture and firmness.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected by elaborate sewers.
Remains of sewers have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In Roman society, bathrooms were sometimes located in public baths where both men and women bathed.
If you want to send a message to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
An orbiting satellite picks up your call and drops it back to earth, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere blocks some of our visible light.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] long to launch a satellite or a telescope.
The earth's rotation has revolutionized the world in amazing ways, not the least of which is our ability to move quickly and easily.
The circuit gave us trains, automobiles, and other means of transportation.
Among these are other medium-sized mammals that feed on small animals ranging from insects to pigeons and lizards.
Finally, there are the small mammals (including house cats) that feed on such tiny creatures as insects, worms, lizards, and tuna.
The secret of the animals' success is strategy, a unique skill that allows them to compete with one another.
Lions are gregarious animals, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of from one to three males of the same family, as well as up to thirty females.
Females usually mate with males in families, forming an extended family of brothers and sisters.
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in character, and are even more dangerous to eat.
One of the world's fastest animals, the tiger can climb (albeit with some difficulty), swim, leap, and pull five times as much as the strongest human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus Panthera as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The roar of the cheetah is quite different from that of the lion, especially when the attack is powerful and aggressive.
The ocelot prefers small prey, such as monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds, and will eat almost anything it can catch.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, sniffing out human prey as it passes overhead.
Ocelots hunt for food by mimicking the landscape and stalking prey.
When a relatively small number of species become separated from the main population (for example, by moving to a new mountain, river, or island from which it will be impossible to return) they find themselves in a different environment than the one from which they came.
This new environment has unique resources and unique competitive advantages, so the new population will need new tools to become more competitive than it has been in the past.
The rest of the population has remained virtually unchanged.
Over time, the population adapts to the new environment, becoming increasingly differentiated from the rest.
Eventually, after thousands or even billions of years, these two parts of the galaxy will seem too different to be brothers.
We call this process spaciation, which simply means the creation of something new. Spacing is an inevitable and important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they produce the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants, and many of the foods we eat come from plants, without which animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the most voracious predator of its time, fearing nothing but its own kind.
It has over 70 sharp, pointed teeth, including one on the roof of its mouth, that make it virtually invulnerable to attack.
We do not know for sure, but it likely had a serpentlike tongue, was a predator of crocodiles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and may have been a predator of other animals.
Yet, it was capable of attacking anything that ventured into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While many of their foods may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of unique and bizarre elements of their festivals, including pigs, peacocks, turkeys, and a type of dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals on couches, while wealthy men preferred to have banquets in private dining rooms.
Ancient Roman civilization would not have included the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even chickens, and no one in ancient Rome ate quail.
For each of their deities, the Babylonians built the first temple thought to be the house of that deity.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to please the supreme deity by feasting and celebrating.
When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.
Sometimes pyramidlike towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower is the sanctuary of their god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was a modest dwelling.
Much of Hebrew family life was chaotic.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops had open tables facing the street.
Logs were scarce in the land of Canaan, so timber was expensive.
Greenland's population was scattered. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled to Iceland for murder, and on his way east, he discovered Greenland and settled there.
Even so, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area.
Although each country was part of 'Scandinavia,' there were many differences in people, kings, customs, and legends between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever visited the National Treasure exhibit, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", which appear below the original.
Although no one knows who wrote these words, it is known that early in its existence, the main body of the document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for safekeeping.
So it is possible that these words were inserted figuratively.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but not of the south.
It remained under the control of "Vichy" France, which had made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders during the war.
On February 15, 1940, the Allies invaded northern France in what came to be called the "Dragon Invasion".
Within two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and begun the invasion of Germany.
A civilization is a pattern of behavior shared by a large group of people living and working together, a community.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning society, in conjunction with the Latin civis, meaning citizenship, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also describes the size of a community.
City-states precede states. A highly developed society means that knowledge is shared across generations, traditions endure and are adequately disseminated.
Smaller traditions often disappear without leaving behind any convincing legends and fail to be recognized as authentic societies.
During the American War of Independence from Great Britain, the original thirteen colonies established independent governments - with Congress as the sole organ - under the Articles of Confederation.
The assembly had no taxing power and, in the absence of a secular government or judiciary, depended on the often uncooperative city magistrates to carry out its duties.
Nor did it have the authority to abolish the collection of taxes and tolls between cities.
The charter required the unanimous consent of all the cities before it could be amended and the cities considered the national government so weak that their representatives were often absent.
Italy is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Windsurfing is especially popular in the northern regions, where Italy has competed in world and Olympic championships.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the main one being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the collection of islands that Japan occupies, Japan is often referred to in geographical terms as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a settlement on the west coast of Taiwan, began to change the traditional patterns of cultivation, and recruited Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the Taiwan peninsula and the northern river delta and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after winning the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The site of Machu Pichu consists of three parts, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings along the boulevard have been restored to give visitors a good idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, about 30 percent of Machu Pichu had been excavated.
For example, the world's most popular motion picture format is 35mm, which was the dominant format until the end of analog photography.
It is still produced today, but it has largely been replaced by digital cameras with built-in image sensors.
The 35mm format, however, is somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This ratio (twelve divided by one) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
Many common types (the APS family, for example) are at or near these levels.
The third principle that is often confused and challenged is the simple principle of creating dynamic objects while maintaining the same scale as in the diagram.
It suggests that the best approach to the main subject is at the intersection of two lines that divide the picture into thirds (see illustration).
During the Middle Ages in Europe, the Catholic Church, which had acquired great wealth and power, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European cities across ethnic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries.
The presence of power was felt by everyone, from the king down to the common man.
Fundamental to the Christian belief that material resources should be used to alleviate suffering and misery is the existence of congregations.
For more than a thousand years, the church's headquarters had been in Rome, and the power and wealth it wielded led many to question whether tradition or faith were being followed and fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade.
The operation was a resounding success, cutting off vital supplies for military and civilian use, even though the blockade violated internationally recognized law and had been confirmed by centuries of international negotiations.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the world's oceans, endangering even innocent shipping.
Because of the limited response to this submarine, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920' s, the spirit of many peoples and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After seeing the carnage and brutality of war during World War I, the nations resolved to avoid a similar fate in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor (his last supervisor) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique system of chronology; each Chinese era or dynasty was a distinct era.
Between each dynasty there was a period of division into provinces, the best-known of which was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms epoch between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, fierce battles raged between rival kingdoms for the throne.
In Chinese history, the period of the Three Kingdoms was marked by bloodshed and the slaughter of thousands in a struggle for supremacy against the Xi'an clique.
There have been many advances in socio-political terms such as the use of measurement, the shift from belief systems to collective values, the ownership of land and the recognition that the land belongs to all citizens and not to a single ruler.
And the Reformation opened up employment to all willing men and allowed those with the greatest need and ability to work.
The same was true of the army because instead of rank - based certificates of merit, they were based on merit.
The French Revolution also emboldened many foreigners who had lost their jobs to join the revolution.
Muhammad enjoyed the discussions more than his aimless life. He regularly went to the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to review his life.
The cave itself, which has stood for centuries, provides a vivid glimpse of Muhammad's spiritual community.
Located high in the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the rest of the world.
However, it is not easy to find even if you know it is there. Once you enter the cave, you are completely alone.
Nothing can be seen except the white sky and the round mountains, and very little of the earth can be heard or seen from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids erected in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead contains numerous pyramids (including this one), numerous smaller tombs, temples, and a colossal Sphinx.
The main building was a mausoleum in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and smaller tombs, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family after his death.
The "upper bow" is in the shape of a V and the "lower bow" is in the shape of a square with no bottom.
The upper indicator means that you should enter from the bottom and push the bow, while the lower indicator means that you should enter from the top (since your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger, more sustained tone.
Feel free to use your own signals, but remember that written arrow signals are for musical purposes and should always be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (eleven-year-old Marie Theresse and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Mother Elizebeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on June 6, 1789 with a group of court ladies.
Surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the King and Queen, they traveled back to Paris by car.
The crowd demanded that the King and Queen open their carriage windows.
On one occasion a member of the group decapitated a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The military cost of the U.S. imperialism's conquest of the Philippines was borne by Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. government to pay off their massive debts and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
In fact, much of the wealth generated by this economic exodus from the Philippines was destined for the economy of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the history of the Templars properly, one must understand the thinking behind this doctrine.
The era in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages - a mythical period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by modern reckoning ended about 1500.
The term Technological determinism encompasses several different schools of thought, ranging from the technological determinism or technological determinism to the fact that human life is determined by scientific theories and beliefs about technology.
Technological determinism is often interpreted in two ways: that technological progress itself follows a supernatural path, and that technology has the power to alter the natural world beyond what is taught.
For example, some might say that the truck is the precursor of the automobile.
However, global road maintenance is not just a matter of improving the environment to use fewer trucks but also of creating new routes to reduce the cost of transportation.
Increased traffic congestion leads to more traffic accidents, which in turn calls for new approaches to driver health and safety.
The works of Romanticism contained many observations on tradition, from such authors as Goethe, Fiche, and Schlegel.
In Romanticism's view, the natural world shaped people, and over time the customs and traditions associated with the natural world developed, and these, being in harmony with the social environment, were better than the laws imposed on people.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, so was Constantinople, the ancient fashion capital of Europe.
From 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D. it was widely recognized as the center of the civilized world and a center of great wealth.
By the twelfth century, its presence was greatly diminished by the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts of incense and aromatic spices worth hundreds of times the price of the Byzantine emperor.
It was at this time that the name of the Fashion Capital of Constantinople was changed to Paris.
The Gothic style appeared between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the style was heavily influenced by Byzantine customs in the east.
However, because of the complexity of the system, the western varieties survived for 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europeans developed their own styles of clothing, one of the first of which was the use of buttons during the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is the practice of growing only enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is simple, usually involving the use of organic fertilizers, the use of locally adapted seeds, and the raising of crops or other simple methods to increase productivity.
Traditionally, most farmers were small farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Self-help groups bring together like-minded people who feel left out of society and allow them to develop their own sense of identity.
Customs may be specific to a member's age, race, class, location, and/or gender.
The scriptures describing the permanence of a custom may be ethnic, aesthetic, religious, political, marital, geographic, or a combination of these.
Members of an organized culture often identify their membership through the use and identification of social norms, including dress, behavior, and speech.
One popular way to illustrate the richness of human relationships is to reenact some tragic cases in which children who, through neglect, abuse, or mistreatment, did not get along well with adults as they grew up.
Some children are physically abused (often by their own parents); others are neglected because of mental or physical problems.
Unruly children are subjected to countless acts of abuse or neglect before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; still others reportedly grew up in the wild.
When a child is raised entirely by an animal, the rebellious child displays behavioral (physical) traits that closely resemble those of the adopted animal, such as fear or social withdrawal.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more enjoyable, supporting the student is even more effective.
Student support is not a form of schooling but a helping hand given to people who are learning a new skill, such as using a computer program or starting a new job.
Support for the student can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, the teacher is a kind of support system much like the whiteboard animation found in Microsoft Office.
Assistive technologies are preinstalled software packages designed to question, challenge, and explain rules that may be too difficult for a student to work out on his own.
Children are placed in institutions for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even kidnapping.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of proper nurturing, care, and education, but it happens.
We feel that day-care centers should be a safe haven for these children.
Our parenting style should include good housing, loving care, good education, and good health care.
Day-care centers should provide children with the basic necessities of life
The Internet contains a mixture of material from both public and private sources.
The diversity of methods and uses of the Internet has resulted in the addition of sections in ways that are easier to use and to understand.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" have been found to be important in promoting well-being through the use of the Internet (Jemes et al., 1995).
"Emotional commitment" and "maintaining friendships" have been identified as some of the new measures of well-being by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their survey of online responses.
The use of video recording has enabled much to be accomplished in the translation of nonverbal signals, gestures that last only a few seconds.
In a nutshell, it is said that a person can tell if someone is lying by carefully interpreting his speech patterns.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed how people who are unable to hear words because of brain damage have a remarkable ability to perceive reality.
He adds that this ability to change human characteristics can also be found in animals, such as guide dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic mutations: latent and manifest.
A mutation adds a gene, whereas selection removes a gene.
Segregation and assimilation push these values back and forth between the two sides in every generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for an animal with a humanlike metabolism to meet the amino acid requirements of its host plants.
Moreover, failure to achieve these goals has serious consequences: sickness, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most abundant proteins are found in the leaves and seeds of plants, but these are difficult for animals like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (bacteria, fungi, eggs) are not only digestible but also rich sources of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we might wonder if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
The sleep-wake cycle begins when you fall asleep and ends shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes after falling asleep).
This can be done by using a gentle alarm clock to wake you up gradually without going to sleep.
If you find yourself adjusting your alarm clock while you are sleeping, put it on the opposite side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to change it.
Other alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water and nangi chai, a popular diuretic) before urinating, forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The quality of inner calmness that a person has is closely related to the quality of oppression that affects the body and the spirit.
Less stress, more vitality. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and fulfillment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this is suppression and retreat.
The philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the mahayana way of love and by many practices from Indian Yoga.
You see Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. You have Kundalini Yoga, silent meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, repetitions and visualizations.
The ultimate goal of yoga is God Yoga. Through the vision of many gods the paths of energy become purified, the realms of spiritual energy are enlarged and the knowledge of rebirth is created.
Germany, a notorious enemy during World War II, forged an alliance between the USSR and the USA, and after the war, ideological, cultural, and ethnic rivalries drove them apart.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies became enemies and the Cord War began.
This war would last for the next 40 years and then be fought in earnest, with troops being sent into battle zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had crumbled, and her only hope of survival was to jump off a bridge in Rome.
However, these hopes were not fulfilled overnight, as 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers joined the Belarusian and Ukrainian armies after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo ships are the most reliable means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The navy's job is to ensure that your country can continue to move its people and cargo while, at the same time, preventing your enemies from doing the same.
A vivid example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, with its U-boats, sought to stem the tide.
If the attack had failed, Germany would have won because she had the whole of Europe on her side.
The domestication of goats seems to have begun about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes domesticated goats for their milk, wool, hair, and skins.
Domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, often under the care of a shepherd, usually a boy or a teenager, mated with an experienced goatherd.
Beetles were introduced into England in the 16th century.
Although the chariots were simply long, flat wooden platforms, they allowed horses to pull or push them at a faster pace and to haul heavier loads than modern highways can.
Measurements were quickly taken to fit the rings together, but in time, it was found that the rings would fit better if they were held in place by a metal frame.
This became a common practice, but the metal rendered wooden fences vulnerable to pests.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by cast-iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron bridges were built.
The earliest known forms of human locomotion were on foot, beginning about two thousand years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as was their custom.
Knowledge of bipedalism is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus seems to have been bipedal as recently as seven million years ago.
We can begin to take better care of our environment, we can join a civic movement, and we can even start to speak up for the environment so that we can reduce future suffering in some way.
However, if we are not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to get to the root of these problems, and we need to find solutions.
It is true that the earth has undergone profound changes as a result of human technological and environmental advances, and problems have arisen because of overpopulation and poor living conditions.
After being passed by the House on July 4, a preamble signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who approved it for display in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on February 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document, and the originals are missing.
Most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived into modern times - the group we call birds.
Most people think of them as monsters because of their furry bodies and flight.
But there are many things about birds that seem to defy explanation.
It has webbed feet, lays eggs, and walks on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the interpretation of binary code.
A binary number can have one or more digits, such as 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Toxicity in the body cannot be detected immediately. Symptoms, such as dizziness, are so obvious that prompt testing is not possible.
A good sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or household chemicals.
Look at the label for the first dose of the poison.
The name insect is used by entomologists in a general sense for this group of insects.

Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of their child, to have a baby.
Such couples may choose to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to others.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works by means of scientific principles, which honestly guide much scientific research.
But they are not alone, experiments, and experiments are a form of testing used to eliminate one or two assumptions, questions, and observations also guide scientific research.
Theologians and philosophers have paid great attention to the traditional texts, especially the Latin Testament.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in almost every field of science, including philosophy.
As Greek learning declined, the Orient found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the underlying principles of human physiology and behavior are based on the existence of endogenous mechanisms and their regulation by biological clocks.
Time signatures, which are not simply responses to external stimuli, are recorded in many organisms, including mammals, fungi, and animals.
A biological clock is a mechanical device that can keep time in the absence of external force.
The biological experiments of Hershey and Chase were one of the best-supported examples of DNA as a gene.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Two attempts were made to isolate the phage DNA using rodiactive phosphorous or the phage protein using radiocarbon dating sulfur.
Genetic engineering can take all sorts of forms depending on the type of engineering involved, the value of the genetic material of the recipient organism, and whether the recipient organism is a reproductive cell or a germline cell.
Some mutations can be passed on only to offspring, while others can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism encourages people to visit places outside their natural habitat to enjoy the scenery, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of outdoor activities include fishing, photography, bird-watching, and traveling to zoos to learn about animal welfare.
These include sightseeing, photography, and the study of Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in their cars to go to work and meet other commuters.
In this way this form of interchangeability is mutually reinforcing, supporting a transport system based on autonomous vehicles.
Science now shows that this vast carbon economy has shifted the earth's environment away from the stable equilibrium that has sustained human life for the past two thousand years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about it.
In tropical countries, complaints about water quality or poor sanitation are rare.
Why is transportation the subject of so many complaints, why is transportation a daily problem, are transportation workers incompetent, or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and how they communicate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic is complicated by the fact that the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, however, drivers seem to have a long-term advantage; thus, traffic patterns can be mathematically represented.
To look more closely at the history of any mode of transport, a relationship is established between three fundamental factors: (1) movement, (2) quantity, and (3) speed.
These models facilitate the design, construction, and operation of road infrastructure.
Our ability to fly has made it easier for us to hunt our enemies and to find food and companionship.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to flap their wings and attach themselves to their body.
This provides the bacteria with a few different places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said, "The planets revolve around the Sun".
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the universe revolved around the Earth and not the Sun (or other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the earth does not appear to move.
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on earth, carrying eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
And the Amazon is a short river, in places up to ten miles [6 km] long.
Up to 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and architectural beauty.

Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest sovereign state in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for all legal and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life and much of the civil service, while Latin is used only for religious purposes.
Vatican City is almost entirely Roman Catholic.
Chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can be found in nature and are easily extracted with the use of common tools.
The philosopher Aristotle wrote that all things are composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four elements (in the same list): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he added that they change from one form to another to form what we see.
Remember, there are hundreds of elements on the periodic table, and each of them has its own unique properties.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are known as metals, as are such metals as silver and gold.
You can have alloys that contain certain nonmetals, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit on the last syllable of a word.
Thus, the pencil was a valuable companion for most people when it was first invented.
Sadly, with the introduction of new writing systems, the pencil lost its prestige and its usefulness.
People now type letters on computer screens, without ever touching a keyboard.
One can only imagine how the keyboard will change with each new attempt.
A fission bomb works by combining the energy of a nucleus of protons with that of a large number of neutrons.
Like pushing a small piece of rock up a hill, nuclear fission releases energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they can appear to break apart with little or no radiation.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust.
The lunar mantle is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is dissolved in the water of the mary and then solidified in the water of the upper regions.
There are many maria on the near side because of the curve of the moon's shadow.
Content theories focus on what people find interesting or entertaining.
This view holds that people have needs and/or desires that become ingrained as they grow into adulthood.
It refers to the factors in a person's personality that determine what he will do and what he will not do.
Popular theories of human needs include Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two attitudes can be observed when overseers take the lead: One is the desire to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of overseer is notoriously difficult to handle - making inappropriate judgments, punishing wrongdoers, reviewing matters, delegating responsibilities, and assigning blame.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an outsider who feels compelled to change everything about the group and make it his own.
However, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the group as a whole.
This atmosphere often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Multirotors have the same weight and efficiency as face-to-face nets, but there are some differences.
Small communities often serve as a meeting place for their material needs.
They often have more freedom than circuit assemblies because these groups can meet according to local time zones that are not understood by local authorities.
The existence of a loyal "invisible flock" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is one of the unique characteristics of interfaith movements.
The "invisible flock" is a governing body in which each member plays a key role.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of the hurdles of creating a learning organization in practice is changing things for the better.
When resources are used effectively in all departments of an organization, production and productivity will soar.
For this reason, a company's efforts to work together to solve a problem can lead to new products and services that better serve its customers.
Before an organization can adopt new technologies, management must establish a culture of innovation and the sharing of ideas and organizational knowledge.
Angel (2006), defines the Continuum approach as the process used to help organizations reach their highest level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide tangible evidence for the psychological aspects of genetic research.
The link between mental illness and behavior has stimulated scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumatic stress, injury, and brain tumors cause personality changes and alter certain cognitive functions.
Advances in technology allow us to observe and study brain structures and functions that were previously unimaginable.
This provides us with a wealth of information and visual aids that help us to understand the workings of our mind.
Although AI has strong associations with science fiction, it has spawned a broad field of computer science, behavioral sciences, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Research in AI involves designing machines that can perform tasks that require a high level of intelligence.
Examples include productivity, organization and planning, the ability to respond to customer needs and questions, as well as text, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have developed into a unique philosophy, one that focuses on providing solutions to the problems of an honest society.
AI applications are currently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as embodied in home-made firearms and video games.
School trips are an integral part of every class. Sometimes a teacher may want to take his students to a place where a bus ride would not be possible.
Technology provides the answer to online learning trips. Students can visit a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a natural wonder from the comfort of their classroom.
Taking an online field trip is also a great way to review the trip and share your progress with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a Web site for their annual trip to the capital city, which is updated annually, but the archives are kept online to serve as a reference work.
Social networking sites can also help to improve students' grammatical skills. While students often start out on social networking sites with poor grammatical skills, the presence of other people often changes this behavior.
Since students are often subjected to intense criticism, the author of the essay is eager to improve his writing so as to eliminate the criticism.
And conversational writing "forces students to be more aware of the world around them". The urge to satisfy one's audience encourages students to be witty and articulate (Toto, 2004).
Communicative writing is one tool that encourages collaboration, and it also encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Effective use of interactive writing "can empower students to review the material and critique the negative; by regularly responding to online content, students can articulate their knowledge in the context of other content as well as express their own opinions on a variety of topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful, multicultural city with many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.

Many deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim against the tide, which can be strong.
Once you're out of the water, the swim back is no more dangerous than a normal fall.
You can try to look away or, depending on your knowledge and the likelihood of being seen, you may want to wait for rescue.
The stress of reentry is more rapid than traditional stress (less partying), longer lasting, and potentially more severe.

Freight forwarders are well paid to expedite shipments, often saving valuable time on paperwork, marketing, or quick repairs.
On some routes, the larger carriers have their own planes, but on others, smaller carriers have a problem.
If the shipment is sent by air, some routes may require several days for processing and inspection.
The only way to do it quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger with you, and that's where you come in.
The common practice of flying first or business class is to pay a premium for the privilege (or, better yet, to let your airline do it for you).
However, this does not come at an exorbitant price: depending on the situation, you should be prepared to pay up to four times as much as you would in business class, and eleven times as much in first class.
At first glance, there is little reason for anyone to ask for a discount on business or first class airfare to get from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a group of people who are willing to pay extra to get to their destination more quickly and comfortably, so they pay accordingly
