In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, placing a piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter roll.

Candidates can send delegates to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision following special procedures.

While Israel demanded that ongoing military operations in the valley continue for 10 years after an agreement was reached, the PA agreed to continue such operations for only 5 years.
The shooters in the adjuvant pest control trial will have to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the trial has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSWA) Inc., eligible volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
Following Conservation and Heritage's Mick O'Flynn with Acting Director Park NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in as the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday with nine members.
Martelly is a member of the CEP for the fifth consecutive time in the last four years.
The President's Commission last month recommended the early resignation of CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards fresh elections.
The commission was set up by Martelly in response to anti-government protests that have erupted since last October.
Failure to hold elections has sometimes led to violent protests, some since 2011.
There have been 60 reported cases of iPods failing due to overheating, including 6 fires and 4 minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 risks related to the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company called ""non-serious""".
"The ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as ""truly regrettable".""
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Office of Northern Mariana Emergency Management reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has issued a tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman holds Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least 6 hostages have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed lavender.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone could be controlled, it could accelerate the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that investigators on behalf of the government recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tributes to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons.
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels commented that ""Luna is as weird as I am....more so....love her and miss her...hopefully, she's in a better place""".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was in doubt due to complaints against him.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to overcome his pain as he was banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The invention was verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the basis for Earth's water supply, along with organic materials that make proteins and help life exist.
Scientists are trying to understand how the planets formed, especially the Earth, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He described the rumours as ""political chatter and lunacy""".
It was speculated that he would run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims the next-gen system, which allows aircraft to fly shorter distances, will save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to pinpoint aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no additional transport and no overground trains stop near Wembley, and no car parking or park-and-ride facilities are available near the ground.
Fears over lack of transport meant that the team had to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science on the formation of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that these new species emerged in just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer, due to predation between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and a migrating Cox's piza conirostris.
All manner of work can be made of gold, and all manner of work can be made of gold.
It can be drawn on a thin wire, rolled into a knot, flattened with a hammer, or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This is called the pH of the chemical. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level refers to the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and 1 electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands combines with the outer layers of your skin to create this weird looking, yet kind of scaly shell.
Almost every household in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our view of light.
It takes a huge rocket to place a satellite or telescope in space at a height of 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation much easier and faster.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other modes of transport.
Below them are medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to black deer and deer-eating medium-sized cats.
Finally, there are numerous small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, hamsters, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a special job that keeps each cat from competing with the others.
Lions are mostly social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Thirty female lions and 1 to 3 male lions with cubs form pairs and form groups.
Because of the large family of sisters and daughters, usually the females are closely related to each other.
Like wolves or packs of dogs, lion prides are surprisingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not other big cats), yet also act very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times with the strength of the strongest man.
Tigers, lions, leopards and jaguars are in the same group (genus Panthera). Only these four cats can roar.
and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots catch animals for food by scent, picking up their scent on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and move quietly without making a sound.
A small group of organisms (a small population) will appear to be in a different environment than before when they are separated from the main population (if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island).
This new environment will have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than previously needed.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even a few million years, the two populations will no longer be called the same species, so they will look very different.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable part of evolution and a very important part of evolution.
The oxygen that humans breathe in is produced by plants, and the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale) is taken up by plants.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from sunlight. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat a lot of food from plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest parasite of its time and was fearless except for its fellow mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set at the top of its mouth, making it virtually impossible to escape when it crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet also included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While much of what we know about Roman cuisine is anecdotal, the Romans did include new or unusual dinner ingredients, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of guinea pig.
Another difference was that the poor preferred sitting on couches while the rich preferred dining together.
Ancient Roman meals were not included in the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had never tasted corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans had never tasted apricots.
For each of their deities, the Babylonians built a basic temple, which was viewed as the dwelling place of the goddess.
People bring offerings to the gods, and the priests try to satisfy the gods' needs through altars and ceremonies.
Each temple had an outer temple courtyard and an inner shrine/garbhagriha where only priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
And the oracle of Jehovah was upon the top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home is not so important.
The Hebrew family spent much of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard, shops were just open counters, and stone was used to build houses.
Since Canaan had few forests, timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, Rick the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and later, while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are ""Original Declaration of Independence Dated 4th July 1776"". The words at the bottom of the document, appear upside down".
Although no one knows who wrote it, it has long been known that a large parchment document (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the notation may be attached as a label only.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
This was under the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers rather than fight them.
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, codenamed ""Operation Dragoon""".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and retreated to Germany.
A civilization is a society, a singular culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together.
The term 'civilization' comes from the Latin civilis, which is related to the Latin cives, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and can also somewhat define the size of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. Civilization culture refers to the spread of long-lasting cultural markers, transmitting knowledge across many generations, evenly.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War the thirteen states - with Congress as its only component - first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on government officials.
It also does not have the power to repeal tax laws and duties between States.
Consensus from all the States was required before amending these Articles. The Central Government was frequently absent from these meetings.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is the 7th largest island in the world, consisting of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu).
Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago" due to its many islands.
In the 15th century, Taiwan was first recorded by European sailors as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transition in tribal grain production patterns, and hired Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Picchu, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists an idea of what they actually looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still film photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-ridiculed rule is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become high and mighty, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity held Europe together for a thousand years.
Its far-reaching power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian traditions is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, which is why church funds are unique.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for a thousand years and this power, money, has led many to question whether it fulfills this doctrine.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a blockade of Germany.
Although this interdiction violated generally accepted international law codified by numerous international treaties over the past 2 centuries, cutting off key military and civilian supplies, the strategy proved effective.
Britain's discovery of international waters made entire sections of the sea inaccessible to any ships, posing a threat to neutral shipping.
With limited response to the move, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare tactics.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were very strong policies of many citizens and countries.
After witnessing the horrors of World War II, nations wanted to make sure that such things would not happen again.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the US with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage or ruling family in China was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, the territories belonging to each dynasty were divided into a few years. The best known of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time there was a fierce war between several nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the battle for the Grand Palace throne in Xi'an.
The social and political implications of adopting the metric system are many, including the shift from dictatorship to democracy, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs not only to the ruler but also to the people.
After the revolution the professions were opened to all male applicants allowing them to become the most prestigious and successful.
Instead of the same military ranks, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries.
"Muhammad had a keen interest in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave for meditation on the mountain of ""Nur"" (light) called ""Hira""".
Thousands of years old, the cave clearly reflects the spiritual dimension of Muhammad.
Located on one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if anyone knows it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, there is little view of the outside world, and few sounds are heard.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is still one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and a great sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of Khufu's wives and family members.
The ""up bow"" symbol looks like a V and the ""down bow"" symbol looks like a main or square missing its bottom side.
That means you should start at the tip up and push the bow, and down the path you should start at the frog (which is where you hold the bow in your hand) and pull the bow.
The upstroke of the instrument produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is more forceful and firm.
Keep the pencil free in your own marks, however, remember that there are curved marks printed for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women in the marketplace forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11 year old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4 year old Louis-Charles) to return from Versailles to Paris.
As crowds gathered around, shouting and threatening the king and queen, they rode back to Paris in a horse-drawn carriage.
The King and Queen were forced by the crowd to leave their carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved to the terrified queen the heads of royal guards slain at Versailles.
The U.S. government's war costs in the victory over the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration to settle the bulk of the costs and interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The enormous profits derived from this long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the primary profits of the U.S. government.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The period in which the events take place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, with the tradition ending around 1500.
The term technological determinism encompasses many ideas in practice, ranging from technological progress or technological necessity to the notion that human destiny is inspired by an underlying logic of scientific laws and their expression.
"""Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common concepts: that technological development follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has effects on socially conditioned societies".
For example, it can be said that the development of roads is inevitable due to the motor car.
However, a cross-country road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Increased car ownership will lead to more accidents on the roads, which will lead to new reforms in the field of medicine to repair injured bodies in health care.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawing from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the sense of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, but in the course of time geography shaped customs and culture, which then became better than laws arbitrarily imposed according to the conditions of the society at the time.
Just as France is called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its level declined in the 12th century as warriors returned gifts containing silks and spices of greater value than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow media, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
The people of Western Europe began to develop their own style in the late Middle Ages. One of the biggest developments that occurred at that time as a result of the Wars of Religion was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is typically often organic, a system involving crop rotation using hidden seeds to area or with other common techniques for higher yields.
Most farmers have historically engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
It brings together like-minded people from sub-cultures who have been marginalized by social norms and share a common sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, race, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that differentiate a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of them.
Members of the subculture communicate their membership with a distinctive and modern style of sign language, methods, and slang.
One of the most common approaches used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the unfortunate cases of children growing into adults who were not socialized, through neglect, misfortune or cowardly abuse.
"Such children are referred to as ""unruly"" or cruelly behaving children. Some unruly children have been rejected by people (usually their own parents); in some cases these children have been abandoned due to parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability".
Feral children may have suffered serious child abuse or injury before abandoning or running away.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are known to have lived on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits (within physical limits) almost entirely the behaviors of the specific care-taking animal, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, instructor support goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mechanism but provides a tool to support people who are having a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both imaginary and real, in other words a teacher can think of it as a kind of scaffold, like the little paper clip man you see in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, prompt and illustrate processes that are challenging for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up not needing nourishment, attention, education, but they do.
We learned that the foster care system should be a place of protection for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable health care.
All the necessities of the previously taken home will have to be provided as Foster K Toys.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional uses and modes of satisfaction.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"Personal involvement"" and ""persistent relationships"" were also identified as new motivating factors by Iggie and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important innovations in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, whether a person is lying or not can be detected by closely observing his expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The Presidential Speech, pointed out how people with brain damage who can't understand speech are able to judge sincerity no matter how sincere it is.
He also suggested that such abilities to understand human behaviour may also be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that genetic variation falls into two categories: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Separating and reintegrating between the two groups with each generation shifts diversity back and forth.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a mammal with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino-acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The proteins found in leaves and seeds are some of our most readily available plant sources, but they're hard for people like us to digest raw.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide high levels of proteins containing essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" the same way chimps do on a grassy field today".
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and then falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness when you are fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, and forcing a person to urinate.
The peace of mind inherent in a person is correlated with the stress in one's body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positive life energy there is and each individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended from the Mahayana path of love and Indian yoga through many practices.
In theory, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, with Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is devayoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy pathways are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany became an enemy to all in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. As the war ended, clashes of system, process, and culture led the countries to break apart.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
This would continue for the next 40 years, as proxy armies fought real battles on battlefields in many regions, from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, the only hope being to regroup back to the rear along the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, implementing the plan overnight, 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after attacking Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large groups of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies is to ensure that your country has the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, disrupting your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
With relations with the Allies failing, Germany would probably have annexed Britain like the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes started storing milk, hair, meat and skins so that they could be easily accessed.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds on hills or other grazing land, often as goats or juveniles, often in a flock of sheep, such as the better-known shepherd.
By the 16th century, wagonways had been built in England.
Although the carts were made of only wooden planks, they allowed the horses to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Cross-ties for holding rails were introduced much earlier. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had iron ore on top.
This became a common practice, but caused further depreciation on the wooden wheels of iron wagons.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. The first complete iron rails were introduced in 1767.
He knew that the first form of transportation was walking, and that humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) about 2 million years ago.
Their ancestors did not walk upright like Australopithecus.
Bipedal features have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
This is like symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we are only looking for a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problems, we need to deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become worse due to overpopulation and the extreme lifestyle of mankind.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson signed the handwritten draft and sent it to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
"150 to 200 copies were made overnight, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides""".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon at Independence Hall Yard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original handwritten copy has survived.
Most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's still a lot of talk about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They're scaly, claw-footed, egg-laying, they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on the exchange of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be readily apparent to us. It may cause simple symptoms, such as vomiting, so we cannot immediately diagnose it.
The best indication of internal toxicity is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for appropriate first aid instructions for that poison.
Entomologists use the term bug as a conventional term for this group of insects.
The term derives from ancient contact with bed bugs, which were well adapted to live as parasites on humans.
Both long-legged and bloodsucking worms are related to immature worms, which live in nests or make their home in the body of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has left it as the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that MS is twice as common in females as in males.
A couple may decide to have a child for the sake of their own well-being or that of their child.
These couples can choose the adoption process for their child.
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
Although it does not stand alone, an experiment, as well as an experiment, is a test that guides scientific inquiry to eliminate one or more hypotheses, ask questions, make observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, Westerners became disconnected from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of an endogenous cycle and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, cycling freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment is one of the most famous experiments to show that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or with radioactive sulfur on the phage's protein.
Different types of mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature based tourism attracts people who are keen on enjoying natural landscapes, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from their small towns to work and are confronted by the people who work there.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the private car-based transportation system.
Science tells us that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of the stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
You rarely hear this level of complaints about water quality or falling bridges in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems have such grievances, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 1 hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers behaved within an appropriate stable range; thus, mathematically approximate traffic streams can be said to have slightly appropriate stability.
To better show traffic flow, relationships were established between three main features: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links will help in planning, design and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are capable of retracting their wings as well as their bodies.
This allows them to hide in small spaces widely to protect them from predators.
Today, the only insects without retractable wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was correct but most people believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth (and other stars as well), including the Sun.
That seems smart, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, flowing 6 miles wide.
The Amazon receives 20 percent of the water that flows from the earth's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building continued until the demise of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in their size and technological superiority in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired their monuments dating back over a thousand years.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and one of the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can be found naturally in nature and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
He also theorized that this is similar to the four states (in the same order) of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but that they can change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil is a good friend to most people when it comes out.
Unfortunately, as new writing systems arrived, it was reduced to smaller scales and uses.
People are typing messages on computer screens now, and they've never been near a sharpener.
One may wonder what the keyboard will look like when something new comes out.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then breaking the nucleus apart again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they split with little or no forward motion.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick near the center and 100 km thick away from the center.
It is narrower below Maria and thicker below the Highlands.
Since the crust is thinner, there may have been more maria nearby, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are central to finding out what makes people tick or appeal to them.
These theories suggest that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that are inherent as they reach adulthood.
These theories explain what makes some people desire the things they do and what things happen around them that make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory are two popular content theories.
Typically, two behaviors emerge from managers as they begin to lead their former colleagues: they try to be "one of the guys" (or one of the girls) on the other side of their image.
This type of manager has trouble making decisions that everyone dislikes, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes unrecognizable, feeling that he or she must change everything his or her team does and own it.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's defeat or victory.
This behavior often leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
With only a few minor differences, virtual teams are as skilled as traditional teams.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to separate time zones that their local managers don't understand.
"""The existence of a real """"invisible team"""" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a special part of a virtual team".""
The ""invisible team"" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of innovation is to put organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all the resources available in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and innovation can provide transformation.
As a result, the organizational process that works together to overcome an obstacle leads to a new creative process that serves the customer's need.
Before the organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of creativity as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method to help an organization reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the research area and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
We've known for a long time that brain injuries, mental illness, tumors, and other types of damage can affect people's psychological well-being and cause changes in their behavior.
New technologies allow further investigation to see brain structures and processes as never seen before.
This will provide us with the information and materials to build various simulation models to understand the various processes in our brain.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, involving behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI is immersed in making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, controlling, planning, arranging, solving user questions and problems as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such topics have become distinct behaviors that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as built into most home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher prefers to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or sit in their classrooms and admire beautiful art.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to replicate a trip pussy and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is updated every year, but the old ones are kept online for students to review if needed.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, however, the presence of the audience usually varies.
Since students are often the most critical audience, to avoid criticism, the blogger starts working on improving the writing.
"""Also blogging """forces students to become more informed about the world around them"."" """The need to feed the audience's interest inspires and keeps students interested (Toto, 2004)".""
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
"""Appropriate use of blogs """empowers students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others as well as explain their own perspectives on specific issues (Orevek, 2002)".""
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and has an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls in the far south and the never-before-seen Muskoka in the north are home to even greater natural beauty.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as Canadian to outsiders.
The vast northern provinces are sparsely populated, some lying in almost uninhabited wilderness.
To compare the demographics, which surprised many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent countries, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to their areas, and this took a long time in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable to tell any female passenger that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
1 Wearing a ring is also useful (besides looking expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can be considered harassment and that it is not uncommon to follow, hold hands, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to be consistent with your intentions (even if culturally different, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century by Berber fishermen, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar el-Badia and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, pots, leather goods, hookahs, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, east of Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano buried many of Goma's streets, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, anyone who has traveled outside of Goma can understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is home to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa as well as climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma. The regular (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative obscurity, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was also added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was a featured location on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2, and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each with unique wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered a staple of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It is advantageous to purchase a wildcard that gives access to some of the parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory its name and is a major destination for many tourists.
Hong Kong's skyscrapers line the waters of Victoria Harbour, which still resembles a shimmering bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists made their home, and if you're looking for the country's colonial roots, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested land in the Indian territory is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
These mangroves are not just wetlands - they are remnants of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans mangrove forests cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/mud.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and towards Jakhar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are often full so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby areas such as Paro (Nu 150) and Rekha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers will have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters and two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, although it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 with completion of Brazilian Customs check points.
The Guarani are now the most important indigenous group living in eastern Paraguay, living as seminomadic hunter-gatherers who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who make a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"""In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as ""The Giant Province of the Indies"", emerged as a result of resistance by groups of indigenous nobles against Spanish invaders".""
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous nature and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Los Ca√±itas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged from FIC West Store at the only bank in Stanley Islands.
British pounds are generally valid anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often valid.
Credit cards are not accepted on the surrounding islands, although they are likely to accept British and United States currency; find out in advance by asking the owners there what payment method they use.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer, temperatures above +30 ¬∞C are common in the region.
In winter, the cold here is extreme: temperatures rarely reach freezing, but the air and humidity together feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
"There are no distinct ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is not wild and should not be grazed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
As ferocious as they may seem, they can attack bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal.
Each year, dozens of spectators are injured because they are not at the right distance. These animals are large, fierce, and dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing odorous food and keep campsites clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was a notorious naval base in 1889, when seven ships from Germany and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese Lelopi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the closure of two harbours. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The northern coastal beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are beaches that are sometimes crowded with families, with good shops along the shore.
"The main local beer here is 'Number One', which is not a good beer, but it is fun and new fun. Another local beer here is called ""Manta""".
There are a lot of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel well.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're scared.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black 'espresso', with cappuccino cream (not froth), is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
The reef is visited by many tourists throughout the year and injuries on the reef are rare.
Still, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all posted signs, and carefully heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and along riverbanks north of 1770 from October to April. They are occasionally seen outside during these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks swim away in fear of humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the sea, their primary habitat being the river banks north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, passengers can sleep peacefully once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages consisting of breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or collect other documents (e.g. visa) for your destination.
Any modifications or requests, however, should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the music festival attendees decide to camp at the site and many tourists find it an important experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're gonna have to get to a campsite closer to the music quickly.
Although the music has stopped on the main stages, some sections of the festival continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camps for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as driving through the ice can be very traumatic for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises spend time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check regulations).
Casinos typically make numerous attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually defective, and exits are difficult to find.
Usually, special food, drinks and entertainment are offered to the guests to make them feel welcome and stay longer.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, since drinking impairs judgment, all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone traveling at high latitudes or over mountain passes must plan ahead for snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and ice, abrasion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
When blizzards come, you can get snowed in halfway in a very short time.
Blurred vision may also be caused by snow falling or blowing or by frost or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in most countries, and traffic is uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are a major tourist attraction in Africa and are important to many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to an overland journey to see spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come in close proximity to cars and standard equipment, which allows for better viewing.
Lions, leopards, cheetahs are sometimes shy, but you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also known as a ""bush walk"", ""hiking safari"" or ""footing"") consists of a walk of a few hours or several days".
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies had not been extended to July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets cost 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Ironing boxes and ironing boards can be borrowed, although most hotels do not have one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you do not like to wear ironed socks, try using your hair dryer, if available.
Be careful that clothing does not become too hot (this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various ways of treating water, some more effective than others for certain hazards.
In some areas it is necessary to boil water for one minute, in others for a few minutes.
Filters can be effective, and if you're concerned, then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them and not in their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or spread infections.
Infectious diseases that occur spontaneously, or dangerous animals that can be forced to injure or kill people do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise in some areas.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has very challenging driving conditions, passing through rugged backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of yourself: steep grades, narrow lines and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are much lower than for the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and accidents can occur if tight control is not important.
Interestingly, cell phone coverage is much stronger here than in other places, like the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are as rich and varied as in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples cooked as pastries year-round and cherries and plums appearing in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you prefer some small but rich pastries, they are called Berliner, Pfankuchen or Krafen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, which is combined with meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid".
In the lowland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
To choose from 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses various regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifiers, the term means food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is purely seasonal, with Javanese-friendly flavors of peanuts, caramels, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider, but there are safety concerns when the rider's feet get caught in them.
If a rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup when the horse is thrown from above, the rider will be jerked as the horse runs. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, very narrow, sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to slip off the saddle if pulled back by a fallen rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with large walls and crags of various types of granite.
The peaks have amazing views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes between its endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
"Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as ""ski bums"", planning entire vacations for skiing in a specific location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers as far back as 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing has been recognized as a sport since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
Related to it but usually alpine style climbing is ski touring or mountaineering, which takes place on steep terrain involving the latter and does not require very stiff skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking - rarely will you get the speeds of cross country skiing, however, on groomed tracks you will get the speed of skiing without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent made up of many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling between many countries means going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen zone is unique in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country you visit, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of manufactured items as antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antique items, but they are smaller than mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture brought by the trade is also important to many people in other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami could engage in reindeer breeding on a large scale, but fishing, hunting and the like, mostly as draft animals, have survived.
Today many Sami are employed in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially in non-Romani countries, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want to take the advice of governments as well, not just with your own ideas, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
The advisors can only give a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often incomplete, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it depends on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are extreme weather effects such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and storms.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include blizzards and dust storms.
Travellers are advised that the area they are visiting may be affected due to weather conditions thereby affecting their travel plans.
Anyone visiting a country that is considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will bring up the address of a local company offering the training.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role play, mostly about first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications on war zones.
Tourists who wish to undergo gender reassignment treatment abroad should ensure that they have the necessary documents for the return journey.
Willingness of Governments to issue passport with gender (X) or updated documents to match desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally extensive.
