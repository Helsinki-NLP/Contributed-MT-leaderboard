While an experimental vaccine has emerged that has reduced Ebola mortality, to date, no medications have clearly shown efficacy in treating the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies suggested it had limited benefit against the desired mortality prevention.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp cupping served as a control, meaning that the cupping scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments against it.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has since been discredited, but it provides details that the fossil record generally does not, such as color and three-dimensional texture.
Scientists say that the animal has a chestnut-brown coat with a pale or carotenoid undercoat.
The discovery still offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a finely shaped shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers concluded that the rachis was a late evolutionary development against these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for maintaining temperature or vision. The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a chick skin.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult hair and not juvenile skin.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said that nine of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a Daesh (ISIL) affiliated militant was responsible for the attack.
They realized that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was understood to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to understand a star's Rossby number, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The 802.11n standard runs on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This allows it to be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, as long as the base station has dual radios.
The speed of 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written in response to observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by gravitational forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth, causing ripples, so the Milky Way forces the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have deduced that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is found in the galaxy in a kind of soup, made up of many tiny particles.
Television news footage showed white smoke rising from the plant.
Local authorities warned residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In a speech, he said that the new variant is "very scary and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Other patients may have picked up the infection at the hospital, Dr. Moll speculated, and at least two health workers at the hospital died.
Over the course of a year, an infected person may shed 10 to 15 isolated contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of people with tuberculosis appears to remain low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Pigs carry the disease, which is then transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas, providing mosquito nets and spraying pesticides.
The government has also pledged several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies for the next year.
Plans for vaccines to be delivered to historically hardest-hit areas have been delayed this year due to a lack of funding and shortfalls linked to other diseases.

Infrared images show that temperature variations from night to day indicate that they may well be caves.
They are cooler against the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is unlike that of large caverns on Earth that are continuous and essentially maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with deep craters", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: the voter sits alone in a booth, places a pre-printed piece of paper announcing their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French electoral law strictly codifies procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be clearly marked for voters and observers to see that no envelopes were opened and no envelopes were put into them except those belonging to registered voters.
Candidates may send their proxies to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Adekoya was constantly at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court being tried for the murder of her son.
He is in custody while awaiting trial and appearance, but any evidence found may be tainted because his image has become public.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK but justice works differently in Scotland and the court saw the publication of the photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists are walking a fine line when they publish photographs and other images of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is handling the cases, told reporters that no further comment would be made until after the trial.
The document, according to the leak, refers to border disputes, which Palestine wants based on borders before the 1967 Mideast War.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel mandated a continuous military presence in the mountains for ten years at the time of the signing of an agreement while the PA agreed to withdraw such a presence in only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trials should be monitored by the authorities, as the trials are being monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a move to move the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's solution to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes-violent protests were sparked by the failed elections, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods not working due to overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires that left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's unsolicited report "highly speculative".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Islands emergency management office said that no national damage had been reported.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center gave no indication that a tsunami was imminent.
A former Filipino police officer kidnapped Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed to have died instantly.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Shortly thereafter, the photographers switched places with the elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital Liggins began investigating preterm labor during her spare time.
Her research indicates that hormonal regulation may accelerate the maturation of a child's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators obtained two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna is still revered by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the ultimate Extreme Queen. She was my ultimate manager. Luna died on the night of two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna has the same sense of humor as me...maybe more...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
In addition to the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared that view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
At the conclusion of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed that Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent believed that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her health complaints raised doubts.
She was unable to take the medication needed to help with the pain because it was banned from the Mulays.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number in nature on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been responsible for bringing water to earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to learn how the planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have impacted the Earth since then.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described gossip as "political and foolish talk".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system touted by the FAA that will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-radar-based technology that allows overhead traffic to control pinpoint aircraft with great precision and provides pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional car parking and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities will not be used below.
Fears of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the mules would be forced behind closed doors by unsupportive mobs.
A study published last Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that new species evolve within just two generations, although this process is believed to take longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into various objects, such as coins, medals, or jewelry.
It can be rolled into thin wire, which can be twisted and sewn, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made extremely thin, glued to other metals, and sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can get an indication from the red juice of the cabbage.
Cabbage juice varies in color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H at pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of their electrons (because Hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Swirl the two dry powders and then, using clean, damp hands, roll them into a ball.
The mucus on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which become coarse and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets still existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then relays it back down to earth.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere bends some of the light we see.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It brought us trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Below this are medium-sized goats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and monkeys.
Finally, many small shrimp (including free-ranging domestic shrimp) eat smaller prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of local adaptation, a special job for each cat that prevents competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides are composed of one to three mated males of appropriate age, along with up to thirty females and young.
Women were usually close to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with lionlike characteristics (but not big cats), and are equally lethal to their prey.
A formidable athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit awkwardly), swim, leap great distances, and jump five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but it is more like the sound of fierce, screaming words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds when they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, picking up scent where they land.
Ocelots capture their prey by blending into their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a subpopulation) becomes separated from the parent population from which they came (such as when they move to mountains or rivers, or when they move to a new island so they cannot quickly move again) they usually find themselves in a different environment from where they lived before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different attributes or adaptations to be a strong competitor against what they previously required.
The original population remained essentially unchanged, needing the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to appear to shrink as other populations do.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same creature.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable fate and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they also capture carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants derive their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants and our clothes are made from plants. We eat mostly plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur has a spike that eats away at its prey, so it fears nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the roof of the mouth, meant that nothing could escape its path.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included whales, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While the basic ingredients of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or exotic holiday items, including wild boar, peacocks, mammoths, and a species of mouse called the dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals while sitting on couches, wealthy diners preferred to recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets did not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not grow corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a primary temple that they viewed as the dwelling of the deity.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to supply the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home is not important.
Much of Hebrew family life revolved around the outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open stalls lining the street; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse stories, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling farther west, Greenland was discovered and named Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Thus, the notation may have been added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and ensuing battles liberated northern France, but they did not liberate the south.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies occupied the southern part of France, an invasion codenamed "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks American and Free French forces had cleared southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and likewise describes the extent of a society.
City-states are the birthplace of nations. A culture of civilization describes the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a persistent cultural greed and unequal distribution.
Most of the smaller cultures disappeared without leaving any evidence relating to history and failed to be recognized as proper civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - composed of Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacks any power to enforce taxes, and, having no executive or judicial branch, it relies on the often uncooperative state authorities to carry out all of its activities.
They still had no authority to control tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the full consent of all the states before they could be changed and the states ignored the central government as long as their representatives were absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan holds nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan occupies, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift to native rice production activities and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, named Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they really looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
This is still done today, but more importantly its aspect ratio is followed by digital camera image sensor formats.
In reality the 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is then said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The highly abusive and dimensionally derogatory rule of thirds is the simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under attack.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the states of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipotence embraced everyone from the king down to the common man.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate hardship and poverty and that church funds should be used for that very reason.
The center of the church's authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years and that concentration of power and money raises many questions as to whether this belief is being realized.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated some generally accepted international laws developed by some international thinkers over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering an entire section of the sea, endangering even neutral shipping.
Having a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the enduring characteristics of most peoples and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his first job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different points in time; each Chinese state or ruling family was a different dynasty.
The most notable of these periods was the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times fierce battles raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the great palace at Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people and not just to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution jobs were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, where ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other poor working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, the separation is complete.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" mark looks like a staple or square without its bottom.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and strike the bow.
Meaning the up-bow produces a softer sound, while the down-bow is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to cover your own marks, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return on 6 October 1789 from Versailles by a rowdy group of women in the market.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
On one occasion a member of the mob draped the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The costs of U.S. imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obliged to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray a large part of the costs and interest of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will make up for the main beneficiary of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages is the period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is the term that carries the wide range of ideas at work, from the techno-technological or the necessary technology to the narrower meaning that human destiny is driven under the logic concerning the law of the senses and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism subscribe to two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology itself has "effects" on sociological traits, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, someone may say that the motor car must lead to better roads.
However, the entire national network was not economically viable for just a few cars, so the new method of manufacture was developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
The mass ownership of cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new treatments for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, uniting in the place of society, fared better against the established set of rules.
This is how Paris became known as the fashion capital of the modern world, and Constantinople as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of pride began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
His fortunes plummeted in the twelfth century with the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices far more valuable than those offered in Byzantine markets.
So it was at this time that the title Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the outset Byzantine culture strongly influenced clothing in the east.
However, because of slow communications, the Western style is about 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest achievements of the period as a result of the crusades, people began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of producing only enough food to feed oneself and one's family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, essentially organic, system using collected seeds native to the ecoregion mixed with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel a disregard for societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
Qualities that point to a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of things.
Meaning members of a subculture signify their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and own words.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of association is to take some tragic cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, were excluded from adult association as they grew up.
Some violent children have been imprisoned by humans (meaning their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children is due to parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Violent children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some were domesticated and raised by animals; others are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular caretaker animal, such as its fear or disregard of humans.
While project-based learning can make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, i.e., the teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip that is the human equivalent of Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in a software and are intended to ask, explain, apply techniques that may challenge the student to work alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many different reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, reliable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care must be able to provide all the necessities that are lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The peculiar nature of the internet has led to an increased focus on the use and distribution of entertainment.
For example, "knowledge" and "involvement" have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal networking" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated visitor reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of small expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, noted how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless correctly understand sincerity.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior may have been passed on to animals such as guide dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination account for the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino-acid requirements from plant-derived sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant sources are proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (turtles, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide high levels of protein with all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the wild do today.
REM sleep is the process of intentionally awakening during your normal sleep time and falling asleep in short bursts (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a seemingly silent alarm clock to alert you that you are not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your bedroom, you can move it to another part of the room, forcing yourself to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) and going to bed, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has inside is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The less stress there is, the more positive forces there are in life. Each person has the potential for finding profound peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of light) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods. By visualizing the various deities, energy pathways are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightenment is achieved.
A common adversary was Germany in World War 2, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, a combination of systems, processes and culture led to the countries' collapse.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were on opposing sides and the Cold War had begun.
This would last for the next 40 years of actual warfare, by proxy, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight when more than 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo ships are today's most efficient means of transporting vast quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies traditionally has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, hampering your opponent's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, in which the Americans tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, however, Germany could have occupied Britain along with the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early cultures and tribes developed the practice of skinning them for their milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of shepherd boys or youths, similar to the better-known shepherd.
Chariots were built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Although wagonways were made only of planks of the same wood, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speed and to haul larger loads over the somewhat rougher terrain of earlier times.
Earlier crossties were introduced to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be better if they had an iron part on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of wagons.
In time, iron wheels replaced wooden ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, could not walk upright as we know them.
Bipedal specialisations are seen in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live environmentally friendly, we can help the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some areas.
However, unless we want a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
Clearly, mankind's advances in science and technology have radically changed the world, and the problems of overpopulation and human extravagance have only increased.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people did not think of them as dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that still seem to resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they stand upright, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information in the coded form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as vomiting, should be so general that a quick diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for specific instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug has been used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the familiar roundworms, insects that are well-known parasites on humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Sudlot are nidicolous, adapted to live in a host's nest or home.
Throughout the United States of America, there are an estimated 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most devastating neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the adoptive parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the universe works in a scientific manner. This approach, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Although it is not the only one, experimentation, and experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of possible hypotheses, questions, and observations and still guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West saw itself drifting away from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of free-running cycling, even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of being entertained by sights, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Each morning, people in small towns drive to their place of work, only to find that their destination is the same as the place they left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everything seems to be connected to, and supportive of, the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science has now shown that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or did something else happen earlier?
Traffic Movement is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic behaviour tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be presented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic movement, relationships between three main features were established: (1) movement (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly enabled them to evade predators more quickly and to find food and mates more easily.
Insects usually have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them more room in a small area to hide from their predators.
Currently, the only insects that do not fold their wings are flies and dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Few people believe that he is correct but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and possibly other stars).
This makes sense, since the earth seems to move invisibly, does it not?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is still the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles [6 km] wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of tributaries.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale of the Giza pyramids and the technical excellence of their construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admires its earlier monuments, which were originally well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and one of the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian remained the everyday language used by most who worked in the state while Latin was commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since these are all found in nature in native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he still theorized that these changed into new constituents to form what we see.
Alloys are usually a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can still have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of these words.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Sadly, as new writing techniques improved, the pencil was relegated to a lesser role.
People now type messages on a computer screen, without having to reach for a keyboard.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Some of that energy is released when the nucleus splits again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that mean they can easily break apart with little or no pushing.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner at the base of the maria and thicker at the foot of the mountains.
There may be maria nearby because the crust is thinner, allowing the lava to rise more easily.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have needs and/ or desires that are fulfilled during the appropriate stages of life.
These theories look at what motivates some people to like the things they do and what factors in their environment influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Throughout the story, both promotions may appear as managers begin to outrank their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and retain people.
At the other end of the spectrum, one can be an anonymous individual who has heard that they need to change everything the group does and do it themselves.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This attitude often leads to misunderstandings between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members typically serve as the point of contact for their fast-paced physical group.
They often have more autonomy than more experienced team members because their team may be clustered in different time zones that their local manager may not understand.
Having a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is still a distinct feature of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building an organizational learning organization? One goal for training in organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the most useful department in an organization, creativity and ingenuity can occur.
As a result, an organization's process of collaborating to overcome a difficulty may lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and wisdom within the organization.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. It thus whitewashes the research area and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that were previously invisible.
This gives us enough information to build simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI forms one of the most important branches of computer science, involving behavior, cognition and intelligent adaptation to a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as represented in some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides a solution for virtual field trips.Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is still a great way to showcase a trip and experiences to future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, the website layout changes every year, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience as a whole transforms it.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, the blogger starts working on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to provide interest to the audience inspires students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can make sense of their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and is home to many art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Farther south of Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these factors and many more promote Ontario as what outsiders consider truly Canadian.
Large areas of the north are sparsely populated and some are almost devoid of forest.
For a population comparison that surprised many: More African Americans live in the US than in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or attached to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs still brought Islam to the mainland, and obtained it in a major way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: It is recommended that any woman traveling say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may still be helpful to wear a ring (not necessarily the most expensive one).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may result in what they consider harassment and not common stalking, arm-twisting, and the like.
Be firm in saying no to guys, and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it won't be ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easier to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and the full spectrum of geegaw, but all for tourists.
A tourist city is Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was devastated when lava from the Nyiragongo volcano flooded most of the streets, especially in the center.
While Goma remains a safe area, any visits outside of Goma need to be monitored to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for a strange, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a struggling town, though its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of threats from desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World special on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab versus African knowledge.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the north, and the Crocodile River to the east.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a variety of wildlife.
It is a major attraction in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is daily conservation and an entrance fee for the park.
It may still be beneficial for one to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and to what is considered a major tourist attraction.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a luminous bar chart seen through the water of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
Much of the development of the province of Hong Kong Island has been on a narrow strip of reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the area that the British colonists claimed as their own and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Yet the forests are not just jungles - they include some of the last remnants standing of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbands cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted hyenas in the area.
Buses departed from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and the Jakar/Bumthang departed between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are usually full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby areas, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.50 m width.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic conquerors still trained in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has continued to preserve many of its indigenous customs and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the most competitive teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year took place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and rivalries can still be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) with a value set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are still widely accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to see which methods of payment are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland money outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is situated in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures commonly exceed 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears or wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
No matter how friendly they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they cannot keep their distance. These animals are large, fierce, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so keep odorous food items out of reach and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful town meeting resulted in the assassination of the most important leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland straddles two harbors, the best known being at three locations.
The North Shore coast (in the North Harbour district) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is a mostly sandy beach with safe swimming and plenty of shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour, above the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
It is often a family-oriented beach with many shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines are drinkable, but New Zealand and Australian wines fare better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available only if you are afraid.
To Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign - a short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is based on Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very tasty.
Numerous trips to the mudflats are made throughout the year, and casualties from any cause in the mudflats are rare.
Still, seek the advice of the authorities, follow all posted signs, and heed safety reminders.
Box jellyfish appear near the coasts and near the estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s. They are sometimes seen outside these seasons.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles are not active in the oceans, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have deals on particular hotels, although you may find it possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They may still hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you should arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Note that even after the music stops for the main events, there may be other parts of the festival that continue musically until midnight.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with small children.
If crossing the Northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice will cause terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their patrons.
They often have special foods, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and in their seats.
Also, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying in good spirits.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes needs to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a blizzard, just the right amount of snow to keep you dry can fall in a matter of hours.
Visibility may still be limited by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost unhindered year - round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling overland to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be close to cars and standard equipment will allow good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or going "on foot") consists of hiking, which can be done for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not come into effect until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a clothes iron and an ironing board that can be used for ironing, even when no one is in the room.
If there is no flat iron, or if you prefer not to wear flat socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause burns, or in extreme cases, heat stroke).
Various methods of water purification exist, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in extreme cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without paying taxes and excise duties at certain specified locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which mostly traverses isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, wisdom dictates: Steep grades, narrow roads, and sharp curves remain.
The posted speed limits are noticeably shorter against the front and rear sections -- typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) -- and strict adherence to these is more important against anything else.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service is stronger here than on many other long-distance routes, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and in Bavaria, they are quite plentiful and varied, as is their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods still feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a soup based on vegetables and spices, along with any meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In those regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut husk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without additional qualifications, the term tends to imply that the food originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely used throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features simple spiced foods, the earliest spices known to Javanese were peanuts, cloves, sugar, (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of spicy spices.
The stirrups provided support for the rider's feet under or alongside the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but there may be safety concerns due to the potential for riders' feet to get caught in them.
If a rider jumps from a horse but one leg is caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged as the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, many safety precautions must be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, relatively short heels.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather base to fall into the saddle when a fallen rider is pulled back.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The summits include breathtaking views from above. Climbers from all over the world continue to carve new routes through the endless potential of the walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many people, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on sloped terrain and requiring stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
Under the right conditions, you can cover a longer distance versus walking -- but you rarely get the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on good trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling to many countries means that you will have to go through many visa applications and passport control many times.
The Schengen zone, however, operates like a country in its own right.
As long as you live in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies designate items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America versus Europe.
Handicraft products are classified as antiques, even though they are younger than comparable mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding was an important occupation for the Sámi and the culture surrounding the trade is still important to many who have other professions.
Although traditionally, too, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mostly as working animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is an important livelihood in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although it is widely used, especially by non-Romanies, the word "Gypsy" is generally considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can still ask for advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American residents of the Middle East may face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
