This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or brownish on the bottom.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
As dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but have other feather features - barbs and whiskers - researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development following the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although it is a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not juvenile plumage.
Researchers have suggested that, although it belongs to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult fold and not a juvenile fold.

Experimental shooters in addition to fighting parasites had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, because this experiment was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited, as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mike O'Flinn, interim director for conservation and heritage at the park and NPWS, the four snipers selected for the initial operation received thorough security training.
Mateli lays the groundwork for a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (KEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the CEP as a measure to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Mattarella's response to mass protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the absence of elections, as some were due to be held in 2011.
About 60 cases of damaged iPods catching fire were reported, including six fires that left four people with minor burns to their hands.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional surfing incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the Apple report " deeply regrettable. "
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m., local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman holds Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacks their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and the last six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released in an unexpected manner, as was the Filipino photographer.
The photographers posed as an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in her father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
She trained in obstetrics and began working at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying pre-natal care in her spare time.
His research suggests that if a hormone is administered it will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated "Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. A brave woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented "Luna was as amazing as ever...maybe even more so I love her and will miss her...I hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people interviewed ahead of the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should be a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the two ends of the poll, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness has been called into question.
He cannot take the necessary pain medication because it has been banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime to date.
Several people verified the discovery with the help of different materials and software in early February and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, and organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the earth was formed as a result of long-ago collisions with comets.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political discussions and mockery".
We think he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system according to the FAA that will allow planes to fly the shortest routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and reducing carbon emissions.
Satellite technology is used over older radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better positioning and provide pilots with accurate information.
No additional transport has been arranged and the surface railway will not remain at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available at the resort.
Fears of transport shortages have raised the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated the new species evolved in just two generations, although they thought the process was longer, due to breeding between an indigenous Darwin's cactus and the immigrant cactus Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be transformed into any shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be transformed into twisted or braided metal strands, forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and stick to other metals. It is so thin that it was sometimes used for images made by hand in illuminated manuscripts.
This is what we call the pH of a chemical.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen is its protons stripped of its electrons (since hydrogen atoms contain a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, using clean, moist hands, and roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will have a strange sensation and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Arapa and Moenjodaro had flush toilets and showers near every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of cave systems have been found in Minoan settlements in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed groups.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and send it back down, almost simultaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
Rubber has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing rubber has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
He provides trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are many medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized predators from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) eat mostly small predators such as birds, insects, rodents, and lizards.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, the special job each cat occupies that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in an age group called a pride.
The pride is made up of three adult males and about 30 females and their cubs.
Women are usually closer to one another because they form a large family of sisters.
Pride lions act like packs of dogs, animals that are similar to lions (but unlike other large animals) in behavior, which can also be motivated by jealousy.
A well-balanced athlete, tigers can climb (but not leap well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with a force five times that of strong humans.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Jan Panther) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like that of a roaring lion but is more like a snarling, piercing cry.
They prey on small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, lizards, and birds when they can.
Scientists think the osprey tracks and finds its prey by scent, as it scents where it is in the field.
They can see well in the dark with night vision and move silently as well. Owls hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and jumping on prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (for example, by moving up a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island in a way from which it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from what it was before.
This new environment has some different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what they needed before.
The native population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it starts to look more and more like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that we won't even be able to call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a crucial part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide humans release (i.e. emit).
Plants manufacture their own food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the most skilled predator of its day, fearless of all but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws have more than 70 sharp teeth and an extra razor-sharp appendage at the tip, ensuring that nothing gets past it.
His diet included turtles, large fish, and other crustaceans, and he may have been a cannibal.
It attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
Although most of their foods are familiar, the Romans had their own unusual or novelties, such as blood sausage, bread, frogs, and a red dye called vervain.
The difference was that while the poor sat with the woman on couches, the rich preferred to have the banquet together while reclining at the table.
Ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods imported from Europe and the Americas or Asia until centuries later.
For example, they have no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted beans.
The Babylonians had a central temple for each of their gods, viewed as the house of that god.
The people offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs with rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could go.
At times, special pyramidlike structures called ziggurats were also built as part of the temples.
The top of the mound was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life revolved around the family hearth.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open-air butcher shops lining the street.
In the land of Canaan, wood was scarce and expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled to Iceland for reasons of death and while travelling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you think maybe the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there was writing on the back, it was not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large scroll (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by "Vichy", the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and headed back toward Germany.
A civilization is the shared culture of a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, in relation to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defined in terms of the size of the society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence of what has come to be known as civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as it had no national executive or judicial power, relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce those laws.
Nor does it have authority over laws and taxes between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states did not take the central government seriously as their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands it owns, Japan often designates a geographical feature as an "archipelago".
'Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it granted Taiwan sovereignty to Japan, which ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and reconstruction continues to this day.
For example, the world's most popular still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film period.
To this day they are still made, but the image format has been transferred to the image sensor of digital devices.
The actual format is 35mm, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
All commonly encountered formats (APS family formats, for example) are equal or nearly equal.
The rule of thirds, much maligned and often ridiculed is a simple guideline that creates the whole ritual while maintaining some order in an image.
It shows that the most efficient place to place the main subject would be at the intersection of the lines that divide the images into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period in European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church stood in the way.
For more than a thousand years, European nations were bound together by Christianity despite differences in language and culture.
His omnipotence reaches from the highest to the lowest.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and church coffers exist specifically for that purpose.
The church's central authority has been Rome for more than a thousand years and the concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the church's principles are being upheld.
Shortly after the armistice, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violates international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering any part of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As this response and tactics were limited, Germany expected a similar response and unrestricted naval warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar catastrophe in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinct style and style that reflected the different periods; each stage of Chinese history or dynasty was a separate dynasty.
And each dynasty always had a period when provinces were divided. The most famous period of all is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce battles raged between various nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with many people dying as they fought for supremacy over the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the passage from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Similarly, after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates in order to allow the more accomplished and ambitious to succeed.
It's even true for armies because instead of classifying armies by class we classify them by level.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the ordinary framework of life. He used to frequent a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's many spiritual leanings.
Perched atop a mountain in northern Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if you knew of its existence, it would be very difficult to find.
You can see nothing but clear skies and majestic mountains all around, and you hear and see little of the world outside.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), tombs, temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and the many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "up bow" mark resembles a V and the "down bow" mark resembles a staple or a square missing the inner face.
High means you have to start at the tip and push the arrow, and low means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the arrow) and shoot the arrow.
An upstroke produces a usually soft sound but a downstroke produces a louder and firmer sound.
Feel free to write your own markings in pencil, but remember the printed markings are there for a musical purpose and must be respected.
A crowd of women selling in the marketplace forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Queen Elizabeth to leave Versailles and return to Paris on 6 October 1789.
In a frenzy, they surround Paris with a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to roll down the windows of their car.
At one point, a member of the mob shook the head of a royal guard who had Vercingetorix executed in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of US imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the costs and interest of bonds negotiated on behalf of the Philippine government through the intermediary of the Wall Street banking establishment.
Certainly, the considerable benefits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people represented fundamental benefits to US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The age in which these events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages the period in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages followed by the Late Middle Ages which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and the manifestations of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: the development of technology itself follows a path that transcends cultural and political influences and the technology in turn has "effects" on society that are its own rather than conditioned by society.
For example, they may say that cars must lead the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for a small number of vehicles only, so many means of production have been developed to make the cost of owning a car lower.
The proliferation of automobiles and the resulting increase in traffic accidents have led to the development of new medical techniques to repair damaged organs.
Romanticism was a major component of cultural determinism, as writers such as Goethe, Fitche and Schlegel do.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and geography-linked customs and cultures became adapted to their socially isolated places and appeared better than the arbitrary laws imposed on them.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 AD.
It lost its status during the 12th century because Crusaders often returned with gifts of silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the communication channels, the style of the locks may take a delay of 25 to 30 days.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the era, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming designed to produce a quantity of food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses seeds preserved and grown in the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, subsistence farming has been the norm, and it still is in many developing lands.
They appeal to like-minded people who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as specific may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and needlework.
One of the most widely used methods to show the importance of socialization is based on some deplorable cases of children who with negligence, misfortune or deliberate abuse by adults were not socialized during childhood.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases abandonment was due to parental rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may be severely abused or injured before being abandoned or escaping.
Others would be raised by animals; some would live alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit some behaviors (within their physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animals in their charge, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the support system goes further.
Echolocation is not a learning method but rather an aid that brings support to people experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or launching a new project.
The echo chambers can be either virtual or real. In other words, a teacher is a form of echo chamber, but so is the little Microsoft Office guy.
Virtual samples are integrated into the software and are intended to interview, guide and explain procedures that the student will have difficulty managing on his own.
Children in orphanages are subjected to various forms of neglect, violence, and abuse.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and protective.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
The foster care system was designed to offer safe housing, caring caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
The host family's accommodations seem to make up for the shortcomings of his previous home.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The particular characteristics of the Internet bring with them additional dimensions in terms of approaches to their use and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""continuing relationships"" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to some important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim to be able to tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
It suggests the same high capacity for interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Modification adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of displayed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the wild, it is difficult for a primate with the same digestive system as humans to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Moreover, disregarding this rule would bring serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide large amounts of protein that includes all the essential amino acids.
In retrospect, we should not be too surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to modern-day chimpanzees.
Sleep disruption is the process that allows you to deliberately wake up during the normal sleep period and fall asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done while using a clock that is quiet enough to awaken you without being fully awake.
If you find that the clock has been reset while you are asleep, perhaps in a different position, you may have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime that forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and mind.
The weaker the tension, the more positive the vital force present.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extends it with the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Divinity. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany had a common enemy during World War II, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the battle of systems, processes and cultures led to the division of their countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This was to last for the next 40 years, for their armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and their only hope was to retreat and regroup from the Romanian heights.
However, those plans expired almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops crossed the Belarusian-Ukrainian border after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish nonaggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of cargo ships is the most efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has always been to make sure your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while preventing your enemy from moving his people and his goods.
One of the more notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during WWII. Americans attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean with men and supplies to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, with its submarines, tried to stem the tide of smuggling.
If the allies failed, Germany would undoubtedly conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient tribes and cultures began to farm for easy access to milk, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in mobile herds on the hillside or in other areas of the pasture, often tended by shepherds, often children or youngsters, such as the more experienced shepherd.
Chariots had been built in England since the 16th century.
Even though the chariots were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to attain greater speeds and to carry heavier loads on rough roads during the day.
Overpasses were introduced earlier to hold the rails in place, but over time it was realized that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron plate on them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more problems on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, rubber replaced wood, and in 1767 the first iron rails appeared.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not fare much better.
Australopithecus fossils show some bipedal features dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, while Sahelanthropus walked on two legs about seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering in some measure.
However, if we want more than a temporary solution, we must get to the root of the problem and deal with it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly with advances in science and technology, and its problems have been compounded by overpopulation and a rising standard of living.
After Congress passed the bill on July 4, Speaker John Hancock and Secretary of the Treasury Charles Thompson went into business to print John Denlap's next few dollars.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document in Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap River sites are the oldest known copies of the two documents; the original Aramaic text has not survived.
Many paleontologists continue to believe that dinosaurs existed and continue to live today.
Many dismiss them as dinosaurs because they can fly and have feathers.
Yet, birds have much in common with dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary digit can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are frequent enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Consult the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an early familiarity with bed bugs, which are highly adapted parasites of humans.
Neither insect killers nor pests are adapted to live in nests or hospitable homes.
In the United States, about 400,000 people are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurological disorder that affects young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Researchers have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests - or in the best interests of their children - to have a baby.
Such couples may choose to make an adoption plan.
At the time of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the workings of the world by the scientific method. This method guides the majority of scientific research.
In its simplest form, an experiment is a test that allows us to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations also help in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific disciplines, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek learning, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical roots.
Many of the great ancient temples no longer exist, having been destroyed by the Muslims.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in the majority of living species, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are sustained oscillators that pursue a period of free cycling even when external cues are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were performed that marked either the DNA strand with a radioactive phosphor or the protein strand with radioactive sulfur.
The modifications can have several different effects depending on the type of modification, the size of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell changes can be passed on to offspring, while other changes can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to appreciate the landscape, flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside by car to go to their workplace and cross to other places where the professional destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this saving of carbon mass has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In the developing world, you don't often hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems provoke so many complaints, why do they always fail, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Cycling is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction of their inputs.
Unfortunately, traffic is difficult to study because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably coherent range, and traffic volumes tend to be reasonably coherent and can be mathematically represented in a general way.
To represent the volume of traffic accurately, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the density, and (3) the speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be released into the wild. Their ability to fly helps them escape predators more easily and at the same time find food and mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings completely around their body.
This gives them a much larger surface area to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the sun (and other stars).
That seems reasonable, since the earth does not appear to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is the world's widest river, some four miles [6 km] wide.
20 percent of all the planet's river water that falls into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The largest river, the Amazon, is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the pyramids of Giza in height or technical excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired monuments to their ancestors that were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Cite the Vatican's use of Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language of most civil servants, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Natural chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since antiquity, because they can all be discovered in nature in their natural forms and are very simple to extract with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of the four classical elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was very similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also advanced the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically alloys are mixtures of two or more metals. Remember there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, as are metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that many millions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of the new method of writing, the pencil was reduced to a statue and less used.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to reach for a pencil.
We can't ask what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it must have energy to assemble a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a steep hill, the separation of the nucleus releases more energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The fault has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner below sea level, and thicker below the highlands.
There may have been more frass on the sides because the shell was thinner, making it easier for the larvae to climb to the surface.
Content theories center on research into what makes people feel engaged or attracted to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized unconsciously until they reach adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates people to want what they want and how their environment influences them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can result when managers begin to dominate former colleagues. One of the tips is to try to be "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
Such managers have trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
By the end of the show, he becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team does and pass it off as his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for both the success and the failure of the team.
This often leads to conflict between management and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same rules of excellence as conventional teams, but with minimal differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams can assemble according to different timetables that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible steward" is the accountable steward, who sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of implementing a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to remove a barrier can lead to a new process for responding to customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation in addition to sharing organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006), explains continuous approaches as methods used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
Scientists maintain a correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
We've known for a long time that many types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain brain functions.
Advances in new technologies allow us to see and study brain structures and processes we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build some simulation models that will help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI forms an important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning and intelligence of machines.
Research in AI concerns the manufacture of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond with diagnostics and questions to customers and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become disciplines in their own right, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
EA systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as built into several home computer and video game software applications.
Often, a teacher wants to take his students to places where a bus ride would not be possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours.Students can browse museums, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in classrooms.
Sharing an educational outlet virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with the next class.
For example, every year, North Carolina students create a website about their trips to the state capital. Every year, the site is revamped, but older versions are kept online to serve as albums.
Blogs can also contribute to improving student writing. While students often start their experiments with mediocre grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog starts by trying to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to know more about the world around them". The need to nurture audience interest motivates students to become intelligent and engaged (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their knowledge beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "enables students to become more analytical and critical; by actively interacting with documents on the Internet, students can define their own positions in relation to what others write or express their own perspectives on specific issues " (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is the beautiful bilingual capital of Canada and features many galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north, the untapped natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All of this and much more makes Ontario the epitome of Canada to outsiders.
Large areas of the far north are sparsely populated and virtually uninhabitable.
For a population comparison that surprised many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are found in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and a small continent in terms of land area.
Most of the smaller islands belong to independent nations or are associated with France and are known for their luxury beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to their country, and it was taken in large numbers to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route, connecting Europe and India.
To the north, the Sahel strip borders the region, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers declare themselves married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not an expensive one).
Women must understand that cultural differences can lead to what was considered harassment and not exceptional to stalking, grabbing, etc.
Be firm in your refusal, and never be afraid to stand your ground (culturally different or not, it's not okay).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-l-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find shops selling Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, Moroccan ceramics, oak and all kinds of products, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located on the eastern border of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Even if Goma itself is secure enough, any visit outside Goma must seek to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for access to the Nyiragongo volcano as well as mountain gorilla tracking among my favourites.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Combining the difficulty of inaccessibility, his "Timbuktu" comes with a metaphor of foreign and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city has a strong contrast to the rest of the country, because it has more Arab than African air.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which hosts a different forest.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily fee to enter the park.
It may be to one's advantage to buy a pass that gives access to various South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists to be the center of their interests.
The rows of houses that form Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to a sparkling bar graph, highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To find the best places to see them in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon peninsula, opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
It is the place where British colonists settled and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching about 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the remote areas of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest part is located on the Indian territory called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangroves - they include some of the last remnants of the great mangrove forests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a nature reserve, and there are now estimated to be 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer in the region.

The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge across the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges and Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two runways 3.50 meters wide.
The free height on the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Gwaycurú and Payaguá who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was called the "Giant of the Indies", the result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also be held at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches, consult the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) where its value is fixed at the equivalent of one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at one bank on the island located in Stanley Bay next to the West FIC store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the island, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
In the Ellice Islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted; check in advance with landlords to determine which mode of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency elsewhere, so exchange money before you leave the island.
As Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, it is now summer in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies near the tropics; in the summer months, temperatures of over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are not uncommon.
Winters can be bitterly cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer.
There are no "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the fox is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
There was a change in the legislative session when the House of Representatives deleted the second sentence and then the Senate adopted it in a similar form on Monday.
For appearance, bison, elk, moose, pronghorn, bear, and almost any large predator are hardy.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance from large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife; avoid transporting or cooking food that smells bad; and keep your tent clean.

Because of Auckland's proximity to two harbors, there are many beaches in three main areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend along Long Bay to the north and to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by the pohutukawa.
Tamaki Beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes busy family beaches, with a number of shops along the shore.
The famous local beer 'Number One' is not complicated, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines would be better for travelling.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're scared.
To Australians, the idea of a 'plain white' coffee is foreign. A short black is an espresso, the cappuccino is filled with cream (no lumps), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is the norm in Belgium, and fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries are one of the reasons why reefs are rare.
Always follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Medicine chests abounded on beaches and in estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770's, as well as at other times

Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to stay when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campgrounds through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer deals that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even a flight combined with a hotel stay.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
All modifications or requests must first be addressed to the travel agent and not to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to stay put, and the majority of attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.

However, alcohol consumption affects judgment, and good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wants to climb high or mountainous peaks must be prepared for snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can drive as if you were on unpaved asphalt.
During blizzards, there may be enough snow to block your path for a short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowdrifts or dust or by condensation or ice on windshields.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many lands, and traffic virtually never stops year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focal point for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to a journey overland to observe exotic African wildlife, particularly in the bush.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to hover close to vehicles and ordinary equipment allows close observation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them best with longevity.
A safari on foot (also called bushwalking, bush safari, or bushwalking) is a hike of several hours or days.

There are different ways to treat water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some regions, one minute of boiling is sufficient; in others, several minutes if necessary.
The effectiveness of filters varies and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter some unfamiliar pests in their native regions.
Parasites can spoil food, irritate or, in extreme cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, dangerous animals that can kill or injure people by force are not generally considered harmless
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods and services tax-free in some places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on highways, be open-minded: Steep inclines, small roads, and tight turns are the norm.
The posted speed limits are clearly lower than in the front and rear sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and stricter compliance is even more important in the other sections.
Mobile phone service, however, is stronger than in many other parts of the park, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, as by their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are popular, with apples baked year-round, and cherries and apples appearing during the summer.
Many German baked goods contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts.
If you want rich pastries and cakes, try the regional Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, mixed with meat or vegetables.
A curettage may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of fluid.
In remote parts of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is more commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent coconut milk is used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without further qualification, the term may denote food from the central eastern part of the main island of Java.
Today widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes, the dominant flavors of which are pistachios, peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the support for the rider's legs that hang down on either side of the sole.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but can pose safety concerns because of the rider's crossed legs.
To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear high-heeled, closed-toe boots.
Second, some saddles, such as the English saddle, have safety bars that allow a rider to land on the saddle if a falling rider pulls on it.
Vale Cochamó - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high walls and granite cliffs.
Glaciers from all over the world are constantly carving new paths through its seemingly endless walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on a snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many amateurs, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan various holidays centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Cross-country skiing: this activity is also called cross-country skiing, river skiing, cross-country skiing
It is related to but generally does not involve mountaineering and ski touring, which are done on rough terrain and require rigid footwear and skis.
The skiing route is similar to a neighborhood walking route.
In good conditions you can cover more distance than walking - but you'll reach speeds from the bottom that you rarely see without a heavy backpack on a prepared surface.
Europe is a small continent, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries will involve going through several visa and passport control checks.
The Schengen Area functions however somewhat like a country at this level.
Since you are staying in the area for a long time, you can cross the border without passing through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes a manufactured object as an antique; some tax authorities define objects more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of production for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many other professions.
Even though, traditionally, all Sami were not involved in queen breeding on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and other related activities, the queens were mainly used as livestock.
Today, many Sami work in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments in addition to your own, but the advice is intended for citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The news is a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often vague, general, and oversimplified when compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for hazardous weather phenomena that can cause damage, disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Gale-force winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are some of the forms and effects of severe weather, including thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather in their region as it could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone must have professional training.
An Internet search for 'Course on Aggressive Environments' is likely to turn up the address of a local business.
A course must cover all the issues discussed there in detail, and have practical experience.
A course takes between two and five days and involves simulations, extensive first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines abound with accounts of wilderness survival, but few deal with war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documentation for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports where the gender is not indicated (X) or the documents are updated to match a name and a desired gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor such documents also varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Prepared transgender people should not be expected to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning waves that break on the beach, often at the reef level or nearby.
Because of the topology on the seafloor, the backwash movement is concentrated on a few deep sections, and a fast current to deep water can form.
Most drown from exhaustion while attempting the seemingly impossible feat of swimming upstream.
Once you are out of the current, returning to swimming will be no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim at a spot, where you won't get caught or, depending on your skills and if spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-admission shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not very long), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adjusted to the new culture and have lost some of your familiar habits.
When you first went abroad, people were no doubt patient and understanding, knowing that traveling to a new country required adjustments.
Unexpected visitors may also need to be patient and understanding with travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the region's most exciting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show starts.
The sound and light story is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is a shining star and the narrator of a long story.
