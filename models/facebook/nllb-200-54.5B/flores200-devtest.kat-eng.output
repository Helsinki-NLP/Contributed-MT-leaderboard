Because dinosaur humps don't have a well-developed beak, called a vertebra, but they do have other features of a hump, such as a mane and tail, researchers speculate that the vertebra may have developed later than these other features.
The structure of the cocoon suggests that it was used not for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Although the researchers suggest that this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen exhibits the cocoon of an adult, not a duck.
Although it's the tail of a younger dinosaur, the researchers think that the bump is more adult than the peacock.

Traditionally, the low-tech experience in France has been voting: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper with the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
Once officials have identified the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The relevant procedures are set out in the French electoral law, which is quite strict.
Since 1988, it has been decided that the ballot box should be transparent, so that voters and observers have the opportunity to make sure for themselves that there was no envelope in the box at the beginning of voting and that no extra envelopes were added to it, except for those correctly counted and envelopes of persons entitled to vote.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. In the evening, under strict supervision and following specific procedures, volunteers count the votes.

While the emergency services extracted the driver of the red Audi TT, the road on which the accident occurred was temporarily blocked.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then worked at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with the murder of his son, after which he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in pre-trial detention awaiting indictment and trial, though once his identity is revealed, any testimony by witnesses could be considered unreliable evidence.
This is common practice in the UK, although Scottish law operates differently and the publication of photos is seen by the courts as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed that "journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters it would not comment further, at least until charges were laid.
According to the leaked information, the document concerns a dispute over the borders that Palestine wanted within the borders it had before the 1967 Middle East war.
The future state of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, which is a holy site for both nations, are further topics of the report.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel requested to station troops in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to station troops for only five years.
In addition to pest control, the shooters in the test had to be under the supervision of rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness had to be evaluated.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Mick O'Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first firing received a full safety and training briefing.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martel's fifth temporary electoral council in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martel's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
Some of the violent protests were triggered by the fact that elections have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, of which six resulted in fires and four in minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Entrepreneurship said that Apple had notified it of 34 more overlapping incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In response, the DOJ called Apple's delay in filing the report "truly regrettable".
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The country's Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of human health damage.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
In the past, a Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16.
Several hostages have been released and at least six people are confirmed dead.
The Filipino photographers, as well as six hostages, including children and the elderly, were soon released.
Since the elderly woman needed to use the bathroom, the photographers took her place. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins pursued a career in medicine.
She qualified as a midwife and joined the Women's National Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in her spare time.
Her research showed that the lungs of a baby's womb could be accelerated by hormone injections.
According to Xinhua, government investigators recovered the two flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Luna has earned the respect of her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna, the queen of extreme, was my first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons, on a day as unique as Mass. She was a strong woman", said Tommy Dreamer.
According to Dustin "Goldust" Runnels: "Luna was as messed up as I am...maybe more so...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the incumbent Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic following the monarchy of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent thought that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme, 29 percent thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three-time Commonwealth Games relay swimmer was due to compete, but complaints raised doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't get his own painkillers because they're banned from use in games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, made the discovery of the largest prime number on January 25.
Several people using different equipment and software confirmed the discovery made in early February, after which the announcement of the discovery was made public on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic material for Earth, which can make proteins and provide life with sustenance.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, and especially how the Earth formed after being hit by comets a very long time ago.
Governor Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a same-sex marriage bill into law last month.
He called the rumors "political fluff and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, NextGen is a system that will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology that allows air traffic controllers to more accurately determine aircraft movements and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transport is not provided, trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking is not available on the site.
The fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without supporters.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been discovered in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden and Princeton University in the United States report that the new species evolved in only two generations, although it was thought that the process took much longer due to the interbreeding of the endemic Darwin's ground squirrel, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus ground squirrel, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be recycled into all sorts of things, and it can even be recycled into something small.
It can be made into a thin wire that can be twisted and folded. It can be sewn or rolled into sheets.
It can be cut very thin and glued to other metals. It can be cut to the extent that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or salinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are electron-coupled protons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one electron and one proton).
Stir the two dry powders together and roll them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The skin on your hands reacts with the outside fluids, which creates a fun sensation and forms a kind of envelope.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
In Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece, remains of sewers have been found in residential areas.
Baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths, shared by both men and women.
You're using a satellite when you're making a call to someone thousands of miles away.
A satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of our light and vision.
It carries a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the best thing that the wheel has done for mankind is to make transportation much easier and much faster.
He gave us many means of transportation, like trains, cars and so on.
Below them are medium-sized predators, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer to medium-sized cats.
Finally, there are many smaller members of the cat family (including domestic cats) that eat much larger amounts of smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, voles, and birds.
The concept of a niche, which means that each cat has its own special job, which prevents them from competing with each other, is the key to their success.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, and they live in family groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males and up to thirty females and males.
Zoo lions are closely related and live in large families of sisters and daughters.
Pride lions behave much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are also strikingly similar to lions in behavior (but not other big cats) and are also highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger, a well-rounded athlete, can leap high (not very gracefully, of course), swim, leap long distances, and throw with five times the force of a strong man.
The leopard belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A tiger's roar is more like a sentence of shouted words than a lion's full-throated roar.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and as many birds as possible. Almost all the animals the ocelot preys on are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots sniff the ground, follow footprints, and use their sense of smell to locate animals they can eat. - Contributed.
With their night vision, they can see perfectly in the dark and move silently. When hunting prey, ocelots blend into their surroundings and then attack.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population (for example, if a small population crosses a mountain peak or a river, or settles on a new island and cannot easily return), it will often end up in a different environment than it was before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to release or adapt new traits to become stronger competitors than the old one.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adaptation as before.
As new populations begin to adapt to new environments over time, they become less and less like different populations.
Eventually, these two populations a thousand or even a million years from now will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it only involves the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We use plants to build our homes and we use plants to make our clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
The mosasaur was the predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and it had an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, which meant that anyone who grabbed it could not escape.
It may have had a forked tongue, but we don't know for sure. It fed on sharks, large fish, other mollusks, and may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that got into the water; it couldn't even compete with a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual dishes on the menu, such as tahini, farcewang, snails, and a type of rodent called a gilguda.
Another difference was that the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on benches, while the rich men preferred to eat their meals together reclining on their sides.
The ancient Roman diet could not have contained many of the foods that came to Europe from the Americas and Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
For each god, the Babylonians built elaborate temples, which they viewed as houses of the gods.
Humans offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' demands through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary reserved only for the priests.
Sometimes, ziggurats, peculiar pyramid-shaped towers, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special throne for the god.
The house was not that important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
For most of their lives, Jewish families lived outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard. The shops were open terraces directly on the street. They used stone to build the house.
In the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive because there were no extensive forests.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, as told in the Norse sagas, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its current name.
But despite its discovery, it was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Despite the Scandinavian nature of each country, the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it's not. There is something written on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Mother of the Declaration of Independence, Date: July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows who actually wrote it, it is known that early in its creation a large parchment document (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was prepared for storage.
So it's likely that the record was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated the north of France, but the south remained occupied.
It was run by the Vichy French, the French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the occupiers.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, in an invasion codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work cooperatively, and that's what a society is.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "citizen". It is related to the Latin words "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", to some extent defining the size of a society.
The forerunners of nations are the city-states. The culture of a civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Many smaller cultures disappear without leaving a proper historical trace and without being recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, for the first time, the thirteen states created a weak central government - Congress was its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state agencies that often did not cooperate with others to enforce its acts.
It also had no authority over interstate tax laws and tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles of Confederation required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states had such a lax attitude towards the central government that their representatives often did not attend the discussion.
The Italy national football team, like the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world. They won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
With almost 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history began in the 15th century when European sailors called the island Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
The Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating changes in aboriginal grain production and employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885 after the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and a three-story room.
Most of the buildings on the banks of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
30% of Machu Picchu was restored in 1976, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most widely used motion picture format is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is derived from the image converter format of the digital camera.
The 35mm format, 36mm wide by 24mm high, can be somewhat confusing.
The ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore, as mentioned, 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS format group) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often overlooked and underused, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics that preserve the order of images.
It seems that the most effective place for the main subject is where the lines intersect, dividing the image into thirds, vertically and horizontally (see example).
The enriched and strengthened Catholic Church became the focus of intense debate during this period of European history.
Despite differences in language and culture, the Christian religion held Europe together for more than a thousand years.
From the king to the common people, it was his absolute power that made the biggest impact.
That wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that churches raise funds for that purpose, is a central Christian principle.
For a millennium, Rome had been the central authority of the Church, and this concentration of power and money raised questions about whether the principle had been satisfied.
Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany shortly after the war began.
The strategy proved effective. It stopped the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies. However, the blockade also violated generally accepted principles of international law embodied in several international treaties of the past two centuries.
Britain blockaded international waters to prevent ships from entering full sections of the ocean, posing a threat to neutral shipping.
Since this tactic produced a limited response, Germany expected a similar response in submarine warfare, which was not forbidden to her.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were eager to prevent similar atrocities in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 and began working for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinctive way of portraying different periods; all periods of China and all ruling families were part of a particular dynasty.
Also, between the reigns of each dynasty, there was an unstable era of fragmented provinces. The most famous period among them was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Song dynasties.
At the time, fierce warfare was raging among the many nobles vying for the throne.
In ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras, with thousands of lives sacrificed to seize the supreme throne of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the move from absolutism to republicanism, the use of the metric system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, all male candidates could run for office, which encouraged the most ambitious and successful people to advance.
Since military ranks, which used to be based on class, are now based on merit, this applies to soldiers as well.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in various countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane. He often went to the cave of Hira on Mount Noor (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
He places Mecca on top of a mountain in the north, where the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, if anyone knows it's there, it's not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
You can't see anything above you except the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and very little of the universe can be seen or heard from deep inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. in honor of a deceased pharaoh, is among the largest in the world.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a small tomb, a temple, and the statues of the Great Sphinx.
Pharaoh Khufu built a large pyramid in his honor, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for his wives and family members.
The upper rising sign resembles a V, while the lower descending sign resembles a stapler or a quadrilateral that lacks a bottom side.
High means you have to start at the base of the tree and work your way up, and low means you have to start at the edge of the tree (where you're holding the tree) and work your way up.
Leaning toward the top of the wood usually produces a softer sound, whereas leaning toward the bottom of the wood produces a louder and firmer sound.
You're free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that printed signs have musical purposes, so we have to be careful with them.
On 6 October 1789, the deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and Madame √âlisabeth, the King's sister, were forcibly returned from Versailles to Paris surrounded by a crowd of market women.
They rode back to Paris, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and the dauphin to throw open the windows of his carriage.
A member of the attacking mob at one point threw the head of the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
It was the Filipinos who financed the cost of US imperialism's war to conquer the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the costs and interest of the bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street bank branches.
There is no doubt that the main achievement of US imperialism is the revenue generated from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people.
In order to catch the Templars, we need to understand the situation that led to the creation of the Order.
The period during which these events took place, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE), is known as the High Middle Ages.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, starting with the pursuit of technology or technological necessity and ending with the strict view that human destiny is determined by the logic underlying scientific laws and their implementation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and the other is that technology, in turn, "influences" immanent rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one could argue that the automobile is the driving force behind the development of roads.
However, the country's road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
One of the reasons for the increase in road accidents, which in turn may be the basis for new technologies to repair damaged bodies, is the massive increase in car ownership.
An important component of cultural determinism was Romanticism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic view, geography conditioned individuals and over time shaped geographic customs and culture, which were more in harmony with the location of the socium than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople, like Paris, known as the fashion capital of the modern world, was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from about 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
After the return of the Crusaders in the twelfth century, when they brought gifts such as silk and spices, its status declined, as these gifts had a higher price than the products offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the status of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
During the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries, Gothic reached its peak.
For the first time, Byzantine culture had a strong influence on clothing in the East.
However, Western-style species may be 25 to 30 years behind because of slow communication resources.
The refinement of individual styles began in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages. One of the greatest developments of this time as a result of the Crusades was the introduction of the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Organic farming means producing just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that consumes stored seeds of plants from a local ecoregion and uses crop rotation or other relatively simple technologies to increase yields.
Most farmers have historically engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals constrained by social norms and allow them to form a sense of identity.
Subcultures can vary in membership by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct culture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often advertise their membership in a distinctive and symbolic style that includes clothing, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is through several sad cases involving children who, due to neglect, accidents or deliberate violence, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
Some feral children were abandoned by people (often their own parents); in some cases, the parents abandoned the child because they did not accept that the child had a serious mental or physical disability.
Children who are abandoned may have suffered abuse or severe trauma before they are abandoned or they run away from home.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
After being raised by fully feral animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (with limited physical ability) that are almost identical to those of its foster animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Scaffolding is one step ahead of project-based learning, which is supposed to make learning fun and easy.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a way for individuals to acquire new learning experiences like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The matrix can be both virtual and physical, in other words, the teacher is a form of the matrix, but the matrix is also a little paperweight in Microsoft Office.
The purpose of the virtual doodles built into the software is to ask questions, give directions, and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to do alone.
Children are placed in shelters for many different reasons, ranging from abuse, neglect and exploitation.
A child should not have to grow up in an environment where he feels deprived of care, attention, and education, but he often does.
We believe that the safest place for these children is in the adoption system.
Our shelters are committed to providing loving caregivers, a stable education, safe homes and reliable health care.
Shelters should provide for all the needs of children that were lacking in their previous home from which they were removed.
The Internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet are due to the use of additional parameters and the approach to graphics.
For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When they studied audience reactions to websites, "personal engagement" and "continuous interaction" by Eggman and McCord (1998) were also identified as new motivational aspects.
Using video recordings has allowed us to make important breakthroughs in explaining micromimicry, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
More specifically, they claim that whether or not a person is lying can be determined by correctly interpreting the micro-images.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks showed how people who have lost the ability to understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately perceive sincerity.
This ability to interpret human behavior, he speculated, might also be shared by animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has identified two forms of inherited variability: latent and expressed.
New genetic variation is created by mutation and eliminated by selection from the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination flip back and forth between the two forms of heritable variation for each generation.
In the savannah, primates with human-like digestive systems struggle to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Failure to do so can also have serious consequences, including severe depression, eating disorders, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resource is the protein found in leaves and stems, but if it's not cooked, it's hard for primates like us to digest.
However, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only not easily digested, they also contain large amounts of protein, which contains essential amino acids for life.
We shouldn't be surprised, given everything, that our ancestors solved the laughter problem in the savannah much like chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by setting a quiet alarm clock to wake you up instead of waking you up.
If you wear your alarm clock while sleeping, you can set it up on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to reset it.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea) before bedtime, which forces the person to wake up to urinate.
It turns out that how calm you are inside is inversely correlated with how stressed your mind and body are.
As stress decreases, the positive force of life increases, and the potential for absolute peace and contentment increases.
Everyone can become enlightened, and the only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, and spread through the love of Mahayana and many methods of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple. It includes meditation, Kundalini yoga and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening kundalini energy (radiant energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Divine Yoga is a Tibetan meditation center for clearing energy channels, activating chakras, and creating enlightened awareness through the visualization of various deities.
During World War II, the common enemy was Germany, which is why the USSR and the United States decided to cooperate. After the war ended, differences of opinion about the system, process, and culture led to disputes between the countries.
Within two years of the war's end, the Cold War began, with former allies now enemies.
It would continue for the next 40 years from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places on the battlefield.
The Polish defences had been breached by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise with the reinforcement of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost momentum overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and opened the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying Poland's eastern regions, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way, especially when transporting large numbers of passengers and goods across the ocean.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to maintain a country's ability to move people and goods while preventing an enemy from moving its own people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign of World War II is the most prominent recent example of this. The Americans made no shortage of attempts to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
While the German navy, mainly with submarines, tried to stop these shipments.
In the event of the collapse of the Allies, Germany would probably be able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes cultivated them for their milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that overlooked hills or other pastures, and were often supervised by child or adolescent goat herders, similar to the better known ordinary shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
In the 16th century, England built a network of paved roads.
However, railway sleepers were only made of parallel strips of wood, and in order to achieve more speed and carry more freight than on the more rugged roads of the day, horses were used.
Railway sleepers were invented much earlier to hold the tracks firmly in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had metal cutters on top.
This became common practice, but iron was more likely to cause the wooden wheels of wagons to wear out.
Gradually, iron wheels replaced wooden ones, and in 1767 the first all-metal construction appeared.
The first known method of locomotion was walking. Humans began walking upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
The Australopithecines that were their ancestors could not normally walk upright.
Adaptations to walking on two legs have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus probably walked on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can join the environmental movement to be more in tune with the environment, and maybe even become activists to prevent future damage in some way.
In most cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if our goal is not just to provide a temporary solution, then we need to find the source of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has undergone profound changes as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, compounded by overpopulation and an increasingly extravagant life-style.
After approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap Post Office a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap posters.
On July 8, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, John Nixon held the first public reading of the document.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. It reached London on August 10.
The earliest extant copy of the document is 25 Dunlap's Board. The original manuscript has not survived.
Some paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continue to live today, and we call them birds.
Because they had feathers and could fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
Birds have a lot of characteristics that remind you of dinosaurs.
They have hairy, scaly legs, they lay eggs, and they walk on two back legs like T. rex.
All computers today are based on the virtual processing of binary-encoded information.
Only one of the two values can be a binary number, either 0 or 1, and those digits are called binary digits, or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, and vomiting-like sensations are so common that it is impossible to diagnose early.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first-aid instructions specific to the particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists mistakenly use the term "insect".
The term comes from the well-known bed bugs of ancient times, which are insects adapted to transmit parasites to humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are flawless at birth and are adapted to their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists only of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
The couple's decision may not be in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples have the opportunity to plan for adoption.
Adoption terminates the custody of the biological parents so that another couple can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
It is not only an experiment, but also a test, used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, while asking questions and observing also contributes to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have consulted the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on many subjects, including psychology, were accepted.
The West lost its roots in Greek philosophy and science as knowledge of the Greek language declined.
Many rhythms, often observed in behavior and physiology, are critically dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply external periodic cues, are observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-regulating oscillator that follows a free-cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
That DNA is the genetic material was one of the main points of the Hershey-Chase experiment.
To insert their own DNA into bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments, either injecting DNA into radioactive phosphorus phages or injecting the phage protein with radioactive lead.
A mutation can have different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the sex cells can be passed on to children, otherwise the mutation can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to view landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting sanctuaries and learning about the ecosystem are examples of activities that can be done here.
An example of this is visiting Borneo and taking photographs and studying orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns to drive to work, and they pass other people going in the opposite direction, whose jobs are in the same places they just left.
In this dynamic transportation maze, everything is connected in some way, supporting a personal car-based transportation system.
Large-scale carbon farming has altered the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years, as science now suggests.
Everybody participates in society, and everybody uses transportation systems, and almost everybody complains about transportation systems.
You don't hear that kind of complaint about water quality and collapsed bridges in the developed world.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they have so many failures every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The study of the movement of particular drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other is called traffic flow.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic flow because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100 percent accuracy.
Drivers operate within a range of reasonable consistency happily; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
Relationships have been established between three key characteristics for better traffic planning: (1) flow, (2) intensity, and (3) speed.
These interconnections guide the planning, design, and operation of highway well-being.
The first animals to learn to fly were insects. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily, find food, and mate more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from predators.
Of all insects alive today, only insectivores and mayflies cannot fold their wings back.
A man named Aristarchus said thousands of years ago that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought that he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
And that makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving at all, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and the largest river on earth. It carries eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
The Amazon has a full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or technical sophistication, but the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the statues of their ancestors that were a thousand years old.
About 800 people live in Vatican City, making it the smallest independent state in the world, with the smallest population.
For official communication and legislation, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by those employed in government structures, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen in the Vatican is Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because primitive tools made it easy to mine and extract them in their natural form.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or a combination of up to four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Although this more closely resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, he also suggested that they were being converted into new substances in order to form what we perceive.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally occurring metals such as silver and gold also exist.
You might also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, there could be trillions of them crammed into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil has been a trusted friend to many since its introduction into the world.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pen lost its status and usefulness.
Since people now type messages on computer screens, they don't even have to stand in line.
One might wonder why the keyboard changes after something new comes out.
The way an atomic bomb works is that it uses its energy to make a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's going to split again and then it's going to release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can break apart with little or no contact.
The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust. The surface of the Moon is covered with rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner by the sea and thicker in the mountains.
Because the crust is thinner on this side, there may be more lunar maria on the near side. Lava could erupt more easily.
What drives people and what attracts them is what content theorists study.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that become clearer as they enter adulthood.
These theories explore what it is about some people that makes them want what they want, from the factors in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory are the two most common content theories.
When managers begin firing former peers, generally two types of behavior may take place. One of these behaviors involves remaining "one of the guys".
Making unpopular decisions, applying discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and being accountable to people are not characteristics of this type of manager.
The person becomes an unrecognizable figure at the other end of the spectrum who feels they have to change everything and make it their business, which the team did.
After all, it is the leader who is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Most of the time, this creates a disconnect between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed to the same high standards as a traditional team, although there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often the contact persons of the immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their team may meet in different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p.109).
The invisible team is a governing team to which all members are accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the laborious process of creating a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all the resources available in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and innovation flourish.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles may result in a new innovative process to meet customer requirements.
Leadership needs to create a culture of both innovation and knowledge sharing and organizational learning before an organization can become innovative.
Angel (2006) defines a method for organizations to achieve higher levels of effectiveness - the continuum approach.
Physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring consciousness is provided by neurobiological data. It therefore reduces the survey area and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is helping scientists explore.
It has long been known that certain brain injuries, such as trauma, pathology, and cancer, affect behavior and even alter some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build a simulation model that helps us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI is closely associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science concerned with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the production of mechanisms to automate tasks that require intelligence skills.
Control, planning and scheduling, user diagnostics and answering questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition are examples of this.
It has evolved into a separate discipline that focuses on solutions to real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also integrated into home computers and some video game software.
Excursions are an important part of any educational process. Often the teacher wants to take his students to a place where the bus cannot go.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can explore a museum exhibit, visit an aquarium, or enjoy a beautiful piece of art while in the classroom.
A virtual field trip is a great way for prospective students to reflect on the trip and share their experiences.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create an annual website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated annually, although older versions are kept online as a memoir.
Students' writing can also be enhanced by blogs, whereas, when students start their blogging experience with unclean grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience changes all that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the author of the blog tries to reduce the criticism by refining the writing style.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the interests of the audience motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires students to work together and motivates them to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
By using blogs appropriately, "it is possible to motivate students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their own positions and their own perspectives on particular issues in the context of other students' work (Oravets, 2002)".
Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, Ottawa, is home to art galleries and a variety of museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka and the unspoiled beauty beyond.
All of this and more underscores the extent to which Ontario is perceived by foreigners as essentially Canadian.
The north is sparsely populated, and some of it is almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises a lot of people: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The islands of East Africa lie off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the largest of these, and it may be said to be a continent in itself in terms of its wildlife diversity.
Most of the smaller islands, known for their rich seaside resorts, are either independent or associated states of France.
The Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it flourished on the Comoros and Mayotte.
When the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope, European influence and colonization began in the 15th century.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler, regardless of actual marital status, state that she is married.
It is better to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can be perceived as gender bias, and it's common for someone to chase a woman, grab her arm, and so on.
Firmly say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences cannot be used as justification!).
In the 10th century AD, the modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen, it was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese razed it to the ground and rebuilt it as Casa Branca before abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar-al-Badia, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish traders who founded the trade routes.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is the least attractive place to shop.
Around the old medina it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods and where you can buy tajines, pottery, leather goods, carpets and a whole range of jewellery, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano.
Any travel outside of Goma, although travel to Goma is reasonably safe, should be researched in advance to learn about the fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also used as a base to explore the Nyiragongo volcano and is one of the cheapest spots to see mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). Usually (locally), the price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Because of its inaccessibility, Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for exotic faraway places.
Despite its tourist appeal, reputation, and airport, Timbuktu is still a poor city.
It was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1990 because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during the recording of Henry Louis Gates' "The Wonders of the African World" as part of the Public Broadcasting Service.
The city stands out from the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Zimbabwe to the north, Mozambique to the east and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of the major attractions in South Africa and is considered the finest example of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there is a daily conservation and entrance fee.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which gives you access to a part of a South African park or the entire South African National Park, may also be profitable.
The district of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island. It is a place of major interest to many tourists.
The arrangement of buildings that form the outline of Hong Kong is similar to the elegant colonnaded diagram prominently displayed on the waters of Victoria Harbour
To get the best view of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head for the Kowloon coastline on the opposite side.
Along the northern coast, on dry land, much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is overcrowded.
This is where the British colonists took over and made it their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans, the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretches for 80 km along the mountainous coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests don't just consist of mangrove swamps - they also contain the remnants of once mighty jungles that once stretched across the Ganga valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water.
The Sundarbans has been a sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 leopards in the area today.
From the intercity bus station (river mouth), buses, especially those departing between 06:30 and 07:30, head east and towards Jakkar/Bumthang, running throughout the day.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses serve most of the districts.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around, such as the Paro (No. 150) and the Punaha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de L'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters and leads to two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be commissioned in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs points will be completed.
The most important indigenous group was the Guarani, who live in what is now eastern Paraguay and are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers as well as subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to aboriginal tribes such as the Guaycur√∫ and Paihua, who made their living by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadores mixed with indigenous groups to form Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India".
The Spanish began a colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has retained many of its indigenous characteristics and identities.
In the world, Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and players.
On the polo fields of Las Ca√±itas, the biggest tournament of the year takes place in December.
At other times of the year, it is also possible to watch less important tournaments and matches.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands. It is pegged to the British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands. Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on outlying islands, but British or U.S. currency will be accepted; check beforehand with the owners to see which payment methods they accept.
Try to exchange currency before leaving the islands, as it is almost impossible to exchange official Falkland currency outside the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer in Montevideo and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical belt; temperatures of over 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30¬∞C] are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: although temperatures rarely fall below freezing, the combination of wind and humidity makes the thermometer feel colder than it is.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: there is almost no change in rainfall throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animal is still wild and does not need to be fed or disturbed.
The park recommends a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from other wildlife.
Almost any large animal, including bison, elk, zebras, and bears, no matter how docile they may seem, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so you need to have some space with them.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wildlife are attracted to odors, so avoid carrying or preparing food that smells bad, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This harbor was the site of a decisive naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
With the exception of the British cruiser, all ships were sunk, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful gathering in the town ended with the assassination of the First Chief, Tupua Tamasese Lelalo III, during a fight for independence organized by the Mau movement.
Because of Auckland's many interconnected harbours, there are many beaches, three of which are the most popular.
The North Shores (North Harbour region) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost everywhere there is a sandy beach where it is safe to swim and shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, a prestigious suburb between Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
There are periodically crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops lining the shore. Swimming is absolutely safe.
"Number One" is a local spirit beer that is not complex, but has a pleasant and refreshing flavor. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are easier to ship.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're careful, bottled water is easy to find.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of a flat white. They call a short black coffee an espresso, a cappuccino has a thick layer of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. Fruit juices, although expensive, have a luxurious flavor.
Many tourists visit the reef year-round, but injuries from any cause are rare.
Get advice from the authorities, follow all signs and safety warnings and pay close attention, no matter what.
Between October and April 1770, box jellyfish began appearing near the coast and in estuaries.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most people fear and avoid humans.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is the rivers north of Rockhampton, where they live passively in the ocean.
Advance reservations give travelers peace of mind because they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but through a travel agent you can also book other types of accommodation, such as holiday homes.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and transportation to/from the airport or combined flight and hotel packages.
In case you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa), they will hold a reservation for you.
First of all, any type of change or request should be communicated to the travel agency and not directly through the hotel.
Especially during a music festival, the absolute majority of the audience at some festivals will camp out, which is an essential part of the experience for most people.
If you want to be close to the activity that you're going to be doing, you've got to get there early so that you can set up camp near the music.
Remember that if the music on the main stage is over, there may be sections of the festival that play music until late.
Some festivals have a special camping area for families with small children.
If you're hiking in the northern Baltic in the winter, since snowshoeing causes terrible noise for those most affected, check the location of the huts.
Saint Petersburg cruises include a tour of the city. Visa requirements (see conditions) do not apply to cruise passengers.
Casinos usually do whatever they can to maximize the time and money spent by their patrons. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
To ensure that guests are in a good mood and do not overstay their welcome, they usually provide special food, drinks and entertainment.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Those who plan to drive on steep hills or in open country should be aware that snow, ice, or subzero temperatures are possible.
The force of the impact is less on icy and snowy highways, and you can't drive the car as well as you can on bare asphalt.
During a thunderstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to trap you in one spot.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow or ice, condensation on windshields, or icy conditions.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries and do not disrupt traffic all year round.
In Africa, it is perhaps the greatest sight of safari tourism and an attraction for many visitors.
The term safari in popular context refers to overland travel in the wilds of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to machines, and with standard equipment, they can be viewed quite well.
Sometimes lions and cheetahs and leopards are very shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A bushwalk (also called a bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwal
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with several events taking place at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the first Games in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before they're postponed, you could be in trouble.
The restrictions imposed vary from case to case, but as of late March, most of the restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most ticket prices to attend the event will be between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a heater and a tray for temporary use if the tray is not in the room.
If you have dandruff, or if you don't like wearing socks that are untied, then you can try using a hair dye if possible.
Take care not to overheat the fabric (which may shrink or, in extreme cases, cause attrition).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water takes only a minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you don't like one, buy bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or pass on infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill humans are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods at specific locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who plan to visit countries where high taxes are imposed, sometimes especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco, can save a considerable amount of money.
The section between Fontey Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Road. It often traverses isolated steep forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, control yourself: steep slopes, narrow tracks, and sharp curves can be treacherous.
The posted speed limits are lower than the previous and following sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and they are even more strictly enforced.
Oddly enough, unlike other sections of the route, like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the cell phone reception is much better here.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, as well as in their southern neighbor Austria, it is quite varied and different.
Fruit cakes are very popular. Apple pies are baked throughout the year, while plum and plum fillings are added during the summer.
Most German pastries contain hazelnuts, walnuts, and other nuts, and their popular cakes are especially suited to strong coffee.
However, if you want to try the most delicious pastries, try a Berliner, a Pfannkuchen, or a Krappen, depending on the region.
Kari is a dish of herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be "dry" or "thin".
Machaca is often used in curries in the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, while coconut milk is often used in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
"Indonesian food" is a collective term for the food produced on the 17,000 islands that comprise the country's diverse regional cuisines.
But, without further specification, this term refers to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine spread throughout the archipelago includes a variety of spicy dishes, where the dominant flavor for Javanese people is ground nuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The knight, hanging on both sides of the scaffold, is held by his legs.
They offer more reliability to the spectators, but there's a safety risk that the spectator could get their feet caught in them.
To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken. For example, if the horse throws the rider so that the rider's leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse may hit the rider if the rider escapes.
First of all, most spectators wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some greyhounds, especially English greyhounds, have a safety harness that allows a piece of leather to slip off the greyhound if the rider pulls it back when falling off the horse.
Cochamo Valley - the main rock climbing site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its great variety of granite walls and rocks.
From the highest points of the mountains, the views are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes because of the boundless potential of the walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing or snowboarding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire ski vacations in specific locations.
The idea of skiing dates back to ancient times - cave paintings depicting skiers have been found that date back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing began as a sport no later than the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians founded the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is called ski tourism, ski touring or ski camping.
It is associated with, but not usually associated with, alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring sturdier skis and boots.
Think of ski runs as hiking trails.
In good conditions you can cover longer distances than you can on foot, but it's very rare to get cross-country skiing speed on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it includes many independent countries. Traveling to numerous countries usually involves obtaining a visa and going through passport control many times.
In this respect, the Schengen area works as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can bypass passport control and cross the border.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and preparation time.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes a manufactured item as an antique. Some tax agencies consider items more than 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, meaning that the age threshold compared to Europe may be shorter in places like North America.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Arctic farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture of this activity is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in agriculture. They subsisted by fishing and hunting, and used the reindeer mainly for transportation.
Today, many Sami are involved in modern commerce. In Lapland, a Sami-inhabited region, the main source of income is tourism.
Although the word "Bos" is widely used, especially by non-Romanian people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Bosniaks.

Books and magazines on wilderness survival are widely distributed, but publications on military areas are few.
Travellers going abroad for gender reassignment surgery must ensure they present valid documentation on their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender designation (X) or updated documents where the name and gender match is varied.
The willingness of foreign governments to have access to these documents is highly variable.
In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, there was a dramatic increase in security breaches.
Those transgender people who haven't had surgery yet shouldn't expect to go through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
A strong rip current is a backflow from waves hitting a shore, often a reef or similar strongly.
Because of the underwater topology, the turbulence is concentrated in slightly deeper sections and from there it is possible to form a faster flow towards deeper water.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from swimming upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it's harder than usual to get back in.
Try to aim for a place where the waves can't get you again, or depending on your capabilities, and if you're spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Rebound shock occurs earlier than culture shock (less so during the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For those travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it is often difficult to adapt to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adjusted to a new culture and have forgotten some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that tourists need time to adjust to a new country.
Perhaps people didn't think that patience and understanding were necessary for travelers back home.
In the surrounding area, one of the fun activities for children is the Pyramid Sound and Light Show.

Travel and education are becoming more and more popular when planning a year-long vacation.
This is especially true for individuals who graduate from high school, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a year abroad may actually improve your chances of getting into university in your home country.
Typically, the cost of these educational programs is a fee.
Finland is a great place for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
The coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, however, with smaller boats, even a kayak can provide a different experience.
In Finland, sailing in a boat with seven or eight people is considered a national pastime.
The picture is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, whereas elsewhere, one is unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figures are one to forty).

Flying first or business class is characterized by spending large sums of money for the corresponding privileges (although it is better if you do it in your company).
However, it won't come cheap: you'll pay roughly four times as much for business class as for standard economy, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, on direct flights from A to B, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there are certain groups of passengers who pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere more quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova, which has experienced several ethnic conflicts, is a multiethnic republic.
In eastern Moldova, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in 1994, which, despite having its own currency and government, is not recognized by any UN member states.
In contrast to the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two sides of Moldova have been re-established.

The stern exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears if you show a little common courtesy.
A mixture of Mediterranean and alpine plants, Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very forested place, mainly comprising pine, spruce and fir trees.
