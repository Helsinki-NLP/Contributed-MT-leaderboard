This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
last month, the presidential commission recommended the early release of the cep as part of a package of measures to take the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes-violent protests have erupted over the lack of elections, some since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had identified 27 risks associated with the devices.
Last week, METI said Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "minor".
The minister responded by calling Apple's move "truly regrettable".

Of the 1,400 people who voted prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to becoming an Australian republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the polling station share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the peak of the poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.

Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest single number as of January 25.
Several people used different hardware and software to confirm the discovery by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic compounds that could form proteins and support life.
because comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.

He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen, a system that the FAA says will allow an aircraft to make short flights each year, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions.
unlike previous ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite-based technology to help air traffic controllers locate planes with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional travel is not being increased and subway trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and stop-and-go facilities will not be available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would be forced behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
researchers at princeton university in the united states and uppsala university in sweden report that because of breeding between the rare darwin's finch, geospiza fortis, and the exotic cactus finch, geospiza coniferus, this process took much longer than expected, but the new species was created in just two generations.
gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes. it can be rolled into small balls.
It can be twisted into a thin wire that can be bent and bent. It can be crumpled or rolled into shape.
It was made very thin and was glued to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was used to decorate the hand-drawn illustrations in "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a tracer using the red gum solution.
Rubber juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH in the test chemical refers to the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (so hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
crush the two dry powders together, and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands collides with the outer layers, creating a funny feeling and a kind of shell.
the cities of harappa and mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the drainage system have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths, where men and women sometimes bathed together.
when you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Because the earth's atmosphere blocks some of the light and images, researchers use telescopes in space.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet high is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world dramatically. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us very easy and fast transportation.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized animals, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including large domestic cats) that eat a huge variety of small animals such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
the key to their success is the field theory, a unique task that keeps each cat from competing with the others.
lions are highly social cats that live in large groups called prides.
lion prides consist of one to three young males, up to 30 females, and males.
The females are often closely related to each other, with many being sisters and daughters of families.
Maned lions, like wolves or dogs, are very dangerous to animals such as lions (but not other big cats) and their prey.
The tiger is a well-rounded athlete, able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The leopard is in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). Only these four cats can mate.
A tiger's roar is not a full-voiced roar like a lion's, but is more like the noise of a sentence and the roar of words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, mice and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots save are much smaller than them.
Scientists find ocelots by sniffing out where they were on Earth and following the scent of the animals they feed on.
The ocelot's eyesight is excellent at night, and it has excellent locomotion.
Small organisms (small populations) often find themselves in a different environment from the main population they came from (for example, if they cross a mountainous area or a river or travel to a new island from which they cannot easily return).
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new species needs different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original species never changed, they still need the same adaptation as before.
over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, they become less similar to other populations.
eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations become so different in appearance that they are no longer the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means making new species. Making new species is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
plants use light from the sun to make food. they provide shade.
Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
mosasaurus was the apex predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 blade-like teeth and held an extra set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it had a forked tongue. Its diet included rodents, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly its own kind.
it would have attacked anything in the water, even a giant dinosaur like t. rex.
Although we are familiar with many of their dishes, the Romans had some strange or unusual banquets, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormouses
another difference was that the poor and the women sat on couches while the rich enjoyed large banquets where they ate together.
Ancient Roman diets did not include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
for example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient romans tasted turkey.
the babylonians built elaborate temples for each of their gods.
people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to care for the needs of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
at times, pyramidlike towers called ziggurats were built as part of the sanctuary.
on top of the wall was a special shrine to the god.
in the hot climate of the middle east, a house was not considered important.
much of a hebrew family's life was spent outside the home.
women cooked in the courtyard; shops had open counters facing the street. stones were used to build houses.
the land of canaan had few forests, and wood was expensive.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
but in spite of his discovery, eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
if you saw the movie national treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the declaration of independence.
However, that's not true. Despite what's written on the back of the document, this is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "First Day of July 4, 1776". The text appears reversed at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, early in its life, the largest piece of parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the note may only have been added as a tag.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, however, the south was still not free.
It was run by the "Vichy" French. These were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called "Operation Dragoon".
within just two weeks, american and free french forces had liberated southern france and were on their way back to germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by large numbers of people, a community, living and working together.
the word civilization comes from civilis, meaning civil, combined with the latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, which somehow describes the size of a society.
City-states are precursors to states. The culture of a civilization implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as a formal civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - meaning Congress became their only body - under the Articles of Confederation.
the council had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before being ratified, and their representatives were largely left out because the states did not properly represent the central government.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
With Italians competing in the World Games and the Olympics, winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is called Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to geographically as the "Archipelago" because of its group of islands.
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southern Taiwan, initiating a change in the grain-growing practices of the natives and hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
machu picchu consists of three main structures called enthuatana, the temple of the sun, and the three-mirrored room.
Many of the buildings on the grounds have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of how they got here.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered, and restoration work continues.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but its sharpness has been inherited by image sensor formats of digital cameras.
the 35 mm format was actually somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest overall number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of the stuttering and laughing third party is a simple guideline for creating fluidity while maintaining a certain level of consistency in the image.
It states that the most efficient location for the main case is one at the intersection of lines that divide the image upward and horizontally into three (see example).
at this point in europe's history, the rich and powerful catholic church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united Europe despite linguistic and cultural differences.
his destructive power affects everyone, from the smallest to the largest.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's coffers are set aside specifically for that purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money led many to question whether its basic guiding beliefs were being fulfilled.
soon after the outbreak of war, britain began a naval blockade of germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries, the tactic was effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
the british bombarded international waters to prevent any ships from passing through large bodies of water, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Germany was equally committed to unrestricted submarine warfare, as there was only limited response to the tactic.
In the 1920s, the dominant mood of many citizens and countries was antiwar and isolation.
after witnessing the horrors of world war i, nations were determined to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of thanks to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, his former employer.
ancient china had a unique way of representing different periods of time, with each chinese level or ruling family having a clearly identifiable dynasty.
It was also a time of great instability, with states divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
in those times, there was fierce fighting between many princes fighting for the throne.
the three kingdoms was the bloodiest period in ancient chinese history, with thousands of people fighting and dying as they fought for the highest seat in the xian dynasty.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from realism to populism, nationalism and the idea that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
And after the revolution, the most desirable and successful professions were open to all male applicants.
The same is true for the soldier, because instead of being based on class in the army rankings, they are now based on caliber.
the french revolution inspired the oppressed working classes of many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life. To meditate, he used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (Light).
the cave itself, which has survived, provides a vivid picture of muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
resting on a mountaintop north of mecca, the cave was completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it's never easy to find. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky that surrounds many of the mountains. Only a very small part of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
the great pyramid at giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
the great pyramid, built by the egyptians in the third century bce, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
the "giza plateau" or "giza necropolis" in egypt's valley of the dead contains numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the great pyramid), numerous smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and families.
The "upper end" symbol looks like a V and the "lower end" symbol looks like a stapler wire or a square missing its bottom part.
upward means that you should start at the tip and push the arrow, while downward means that you should start at the tip (where your hand is holding the arrow) and pull the arrow.
The up-beat often produces a softer sound, while the down-beat is stronger and more soothing.
You can mark your own score with a pencil, but the printed Boeing markings are there for musical reasons and must be respected.
A horrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Jessie, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by an angry mob of women shopkeepers.
they returned to paris, surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The rioters forced the windows of the king and queen's carriage to open wide.
on one occasion, a member of the assembly held the head of a royal guard killed at versailles before the startled queen.
U.S. imperialism paid the price of the war to the Filipino people.
On behalf of the Philippine government, they agreed to pay the airline's expenses and bond interest to the U.S. Treasury through Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people provides fundamental benefits to US imperialism from which it derives enormous profits.
to understand the templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the religious group.
The period in which the events took place is known as the High Middle Ages. The 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) in European history.
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a strong tendency to think that human destiny is determined by the laws of science and the underlying logic associated with the emergence of technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological progress itself follows a much broader path than cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on the societies that create it rather than social conditions.
For example, it can be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
the proliferation of automobiles has also increased the risk of accidents, leading to the development of new techniques to repair damaged parts.
Romanticism had a large body of cultural commitment derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography portrayed individuals and, over time, geography related cultures and societies better than arbitrary rules that corresponded to place.
just as paris was the fashion capital of the modern world, constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal europe.
Its reputation as a major center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
in the twelfth century, the situation deteriorated as mainly christian crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices from the byzantine market, which were much more expensive.
it was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from constantinople to paris.
The gothic style was at its height between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century.
At first, the kilt strongly influenced Byzantine culture in the East.
However, Western lifestyles may be delayed by 25 to 30 years due to advancing communications.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own clothing styles. One of the great advances of the period was the introduction of the button.
Subsistence farming means that the farmer has a crop that can only benefit him and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system of using simple, often organic, saved seeds native to the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social hierarchies to develop a sense of identity.
Internal cultures may differ according to the age, nationality, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The distinguishing characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a mixture of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a unique and symbolic writing style that incorporates fashion, rituals, and slang.
One of the most common ways we explain the importance of social life is by looking at children who grew up in poor conditions, abused, or in distress, who were not taught to live together by their caretakers.
Some foster children have been abandoned by people (often their own parents), in some cases because the parents did not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
abandoned children may have suffered serious abuse or emotional trauma before their arrival or departure.
others are thought to have been raised by animals, some said to live alone in the forest.
When fully developed in non-human animals, a feral child will exhibit fully specialized animal-like characteristics (e.g. fear or indifference to humans).
While project-based learning needs to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a support for individuals who are beginning a new learning process, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be virtual or real. In other words, a teacher is a way of summarizing, just like a little person is a way of attaching a paper to Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are contained within the software and are intended to question, explore and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even theft.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not cared for, nurtured, and educated, but they will.
we view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
foster care is supposed to provide all the essentials they lacked in their previous home.
the internet combines features of flirting and two-way communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In addition, "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational themes by Igeme and McCord (1998) when studying audience responses to websites.
Video recordings lasting a few milliseconds have led to important breakthroughs in interpreting subtle facial expressions.
In particular, it is believed that one can determine whether a person is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", points out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He noted that such abilities to recognize human behavior could also be shared by animals such as pet dogs.
research in the twentieth century revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
A mutation adds a new genetic variant, and selection removes it from the defined pool of variants.
Separation and reintegration between the two pools with each generation controversy.
In the savannah, it is difficult for organisms with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid needs from the plant food sources available there.
moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and grains, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
in contrast, animal foods (ants, worms, eggs) are rich in easily digestible proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
all things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors on the savannah solved their" protein problem " in much the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of consciously waking up at your normal sleep time and falling back to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
this can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to awaken you before you are fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the opposite side of the room so you can get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing a person to wake up to urinate.
a person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of stress in one's body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the potential for perfect peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, surrender, and the all-encompassing journey of love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the inspiration of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, creating a collaboration between the USSR and the US. As the war ended, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts led the countries to collapse.
two years before the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the cold war had begun.
it lasted for the next 40 years and was fought on battlefields from africa to asia, in afghanistan, cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were broken and the only hope was to retreat and rejoin the Romanian army.
However, these plans collapsed overnight when 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, forming the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.
shipping is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The usual job of the navy is to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One recent example worthy of note is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
at the same time, the german navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using u-boats.
if the allies had collapsed, germany would have occupied the rest of europe and perhaps britain as well.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat and hides to be given to them easily.
Domestic goats were often kept in herds roaming the mountains or other grazing areas, often as infants or young adults resembling the familiar shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
wagonways were developed in england in the early 16th century.
Although the chariots only featured parallel roofs, they were pulled by horses to achieve greater speed and allowed them to pull larger loads than the slightly rougher roads of the day.
To keep the rails in place, the crusaders introduced them early. Gradually, however, it was realized that rails with iron ore on top would be more effective.
this became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, which humans began using about two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus.
their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Although bipedal improvements have been found in the remains of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
we can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates for reducing future suffering to some extent.
However, if we want only a temporary solution, then we need to find and eliminate the root causes of the problems.
it is well known that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and problems have been increasing due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
after passing congress on july 4, a handwritten draft signed by congress president john hancock and secretary charles thompson was sent to the printer a few lines away.
150 to 200 copies of what are now called the dunlap broadsides were printed overnight.
The first public reading of the document was on July 8 in the grounds of John Nixon Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to the troops in New York on July 9. The copy reached London on August 10.
So far, 25 copies of Dunlap's Wide Streets are known. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
most people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's still a lot about birds that resembles dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers today are based on binary-coded data transmission.
A binary number has only one or two digits, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning is not immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that they cannot be diagnosed quickly.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
beetles are the official name of a group of insects used by entomologists.
the word is derived from ancient wasps, insects highly adapted to living close to humans.
Both mosquitoes and bed bugs have shelters, adapted for nesting or roosting.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop ms.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a child.
such couples may choose to adopt a child.
In adoption, parents relinquish their parental rights to another couple to raise the children.
the main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. this method actually leads to the most scientific research.
But not only that, experiment, and experimentation is the process of trying to eliminate one or more problems, asking questions, and making observations that lead to scientific discovery.
naturalists and philosophers took an interest in classical texts, especially the latin bible.
Aristotle's views are accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
as knowledge of greek declined, the west became isolated from its greek philosophical and scientific roots.
many phenomena observed in physiology and behavior are often primarily determined by the existence of natural cycles and their productivity on biological clocks.
Seasonal allergies that do not readily respond to external seasonal cues have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep time cycling freely even in the absence of external cues.
the hersh and chase experiment was one of the leading hypotheses that dna was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used blocks, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling a DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material damaged, and the germline cells of the affected cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
nature-based tourism provides recreation for people interested in visiting natural areas, plants and animals, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is learning about, visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive to work from small towns in the countryside and pass abandoned work sites.
In this dynamic transportation fleet, everyone is somehow connected and supportive of a personal car-based transportation system.
science now suggests that this massive carbon economy stimulated the biosphere from a steady state that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you sometimes hear equal complaints about water quality and collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply unqualified? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of drivers and vehicles between two points.
unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a relatively consistent range, so traffic flows have some relative consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships between the three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These connections help in planning, designing and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them easily evade enemies and efficiently find food and mates.
most insects have the advantage of retracting their body and folding their wings.
this gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are water turtles and mayflies.
thousands of years ago a man named aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
some people thought it was true, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
this makes sense, because the earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
the amazon river is the second longest and largest river on earth. it carries more than 8 times as much water as the next largest river.
the amazon is also the widest river on earth, at times up to ten miles [6 km] wide.
the amazon supplies fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller active rivers.
Although pyramid construction continued in stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and construction techniques.
the new kingdom of ancient egypt marvels at its first monuments, more than a thousand years old.
vatican city has a population of about 800. it is the world's smallest sovereign state and least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and official communications.
Italian was also the everyday language of much of the civil service, and Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
people have long known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, all of which can be found in nature and are easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the case of the four elements (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he proposed that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that include non-ferrous elements, such as carbon.
everything in the universe is made of matter. all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
so when the pencil came out, it was a good friend to many people.
unfortunately, as new writing systems emerged, the pencil was relegated to a minor role and uses.
people now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to be near a recorder.
When something new comes along, one can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard.
A fission bomb works on the principle of concentrating all the possible energy of protons and neutrons into a nucleus.
It recharges the nucleus and then releases some of the energy.
some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no contact.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The rim is 70 kilometers thick at its near side and 100 kilometers at its far side.
the roots of the mango tree are thin and the roots of the mango tree are thick.
There may have been many maria nearby because the shell is smooth.
current theories focus on finding what appeals to people.
these theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires built into them as they grow into adulthood.
these theories refer to what causes certain people to want to do certain things and what causes their surroundings to make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's dualism theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead their former peers, two traits may emerge: one is the tendency to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns against an unknown individual who feels they have to change everything the group has been doing and make it their own.
after all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
this behavior often causes conflict between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same advanced standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
Since they are more often self-managed than regular group members, they meet in different time zones that local managers cannot understand.
The existence of a real "secret group" (Larsen and LaFastow, 1989, p. 109) is also a distinctive feature of the imaginary group.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team assigns grades to each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? It is a goal-oriented innovation to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice.
if all available resources are used appropriately in the work units of the organization, creativity and ingenuity will stand out.
As a result, an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new, innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), the Institutional Approach describes a continuous methodology used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive testing. Thus, it refines the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The link between the study of brain disorders and behavior will help researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, emotional trauma, trauma, and intracranial tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
the advent of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes in ways never before possible.
this gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our brains.
Despite its strong science fiction overtones, AI is an important branch of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and manipulation in machines.
research in ai involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things become discrete systems, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
artificial intelligence is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is built into many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are an important part of any class. The teacher often chooses to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution from virtual field trips.Students can view the artifacts of museums, visit their aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their rooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future lessons.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trip to the state capitol, which is updated annually, but existing versions remain online as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve students' spelling. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work on improving articles to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's needs motivates students to be creative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to develop their learning well beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "encourages students to become critical thinkers and strong critics; by actively responding to Internet educational materials, students can articulate their positions from the perspectives of others in the literature and express their own views on certain issues" (Oravek 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital city, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
to the south are niagara falls, and to the north, muskoka and beyond, an unspoiled wilderness.
all these factors and more put ontario in a position to be reliably considered canadian by outsiders.
large areas in the north are sparsely populated and, in some places, uninhabited desert.
To the surprise of many, there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The east african islands are located in the indian ocean off the east coast of africa.

European influence and colonization began in the 15th century as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travellers state that they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
A ring is also useful (though it may not look very expensive).
Women should expect cultural differences to lead to what they perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed and handcuffed etc.
Be firm about saying no to men and don't be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, it won't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and served as a strategic port for Phoenicians, Romans and the Merinids.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The sultan of morocco rebuilt the city as dar el badiya, and it was renamed casablanca by spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan items such as pottery, ceramics, leather goods, shisha smokers and general gadgets are easy to find for sale around the old capital, but all this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano buried most of Goma's streets, especially in the center.
While Taya is relatively safe, any visits outside Taya should be researched to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
In addition to being one of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa, the city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Tire, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
coupled with its relative inaccessibility, timbuktu has become a metaphor for a rare and distant land.
today, timbuktu, despite its fame as a tourist attraction and having an airport, is a poor city.
in 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage in danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates PBS's Wonders of the African World.
the city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, having a more arab than african feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions, and is considered a major landmark of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are day-use fees and entrance fees to the park.
It may be worthwhile to buy a wild card, which gives you preferential access to parks in South Africa and to all South African national parks.
hong kong island, named after hong kong province, is a major attraction for many tourists.
the series of peaks that make up hong kong's skyline contrast with the glittering bar chart due to victoria harbor.
for the best views of hong kong, leave the island and head across the kowloon waterfront.
much of hong kong island's urban development has benefited from reclaimed land on the north shore.
this is where the british colonists took possession and so if you want evidence of the colonial era of the region this is a good place to start.
The Sunderbans are the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) along the coastline of Bangladesh and India.
The Sunderbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area in the Indian state is called the Sunderbans National Park.
but the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include the last remnants of the formidable forests that once covered the gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by wetlands.
since 1966, the sunderbans have become a haven for wildlife, and it is now estimated that there are 400 royal bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted hyenas in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the Provincial Bus Terminal (across the river), although most, especially those to the east and Jakarta/Bumtan, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.

the guarani were the country's most important indigenous group, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and engaging in subsistence agriculture in what is now eastern paraguay.
Other indigenous tribes of the Chaco region, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
in the 16th century, paraguay, formerly called the "indian giant empire", was born as a result of encounters between spanish conquistadores and indigenous guerrillas.
the spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of asuncion in 1537, paraguay has managed to preserve many of the country's traditions and identities.

British and U.S. purchases may be accepted, but credit cards may not be accepted in the outer islands; check in advance with the family about acceptable payment methods.
It is not possible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where summer temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Summers can be uncomfortably cold: the temperature is sometimes below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the thermometer appear colder than it is.
there are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons; rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wildlife is wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
Stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other animals, according to park officials.
even though they may seem harmless, elk, deer, bears, and all other large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep their distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, avoid handling or handling food that smells bad, and clean up after yourself.

There are plenty of French wines to choose from, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're afraid.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is quite different. It is a short black 'espresso', the cappuccino comes rolled with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Expeditions are made throughout the year, and there are few accidents caused by these factors at sea.
still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near coastal resorts and estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770's. Outside of these times, they may occasionally be found.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries north of rockhampton.
booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind, knowing that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
For other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, you may find it possible to book through a travel agent, although travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your place if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, any changes or enquiries should be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to relax on site, and many attendees consider this a valuable part of the experience.

Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, testimony is prejudicial to the jury, and all good gamblers know the advantages of not testifying.
Anyone driving over high passes or mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, the pavement is small and you can't drive as you would on bare asphalt.
in the freezing cold of winter, ice may form so quickly that they become immobile.
It may be obscured by falling or blowing snow, mist, or ice on car windshields.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted most of the year.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.

travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save large sums of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, frequently passes through isolated terrain, presenting very difficult driving conditions.
If you are used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are often bumps, narrow roads and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits in the front and rear sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/ h) - are noticeably lower, and it is better to abide by them than to ignore them.
Surprisingly, though, cell service is stronger here than in other places where the lines are longer, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are as rich and varied as in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit bakeries are common, with apples ripening into baked goods year-round and strawberries and berries appearing in the summer.
Many baked goods in Germany also include nuts, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want slightly sweeter pastries, however, depending on the region, try Berliner Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
seasoned food may be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the seasoning.
in the interior regions of northern india and pakistan, yogurt is traditionally used in curries, while in southern india and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 alternative islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without other extensions, the word refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
now widespread throughout the archipelago, javanese cuisine includes simple dishes and the favorite condiments of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
The saddle provides support for the rider's legs, which hang on either side of the carriage.
They provide more stability for the driver but may have safety concerns as the driver's foot may get stuck in them.
If the rider falls off his horse but one leg is caught in the bridle, he may be pulled along. To reduce the risk of injury, many precautions must be taken.
First, many riders make their riding boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
next, some saddles, especially english saddles, have safety bars that allow the skin of the saddle to slide off the saddle when the falling rider is pulled back.
Cochomo Valley - Chile's premier vertical climbing destination, known as South America's killer, with many different granite walls and boulders.
From the heights, the views are breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are carving new paths through the endless wall.
downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered slope on skis or snowboards.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with a large number of enthusiasts, known as "snow lovers", who plan entire vacation seasons around skiing in one place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.!
downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club in australia was opened by norwegians.
Traveling with a ski bag: This activity is called backcountry skiing, snowshoeing or snowboarding.
Although often associated with alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, it does not include these, the latter being done in narrow terrain and requiring very sturdy ski poles or plastics and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as the same as a mountain climbing route.
In good conditions, you may cover somewhat more distance than walking - but you can rarely, if ever, achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on a paved road without carrying a heavy bag.
Although Europe is a relatively small continent, it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling between different countries means you have to go through a lot of visa applications and passport control.
However, the Schengen area operates as a single country in this respect.
In this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport controls and checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paper.
It makes no sense to classify manufactured items as antiques. Some tax organizations classify items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
that is, there are geographic differences, such as in north america, where life expectancy is lower than in europe.
handicraft products can be described as antique even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood in Sami and the culture around the business along with other professions is beneficial to many.
Traditionally, though, not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, using Eurasian and North American reindeer for transportation.
Today, many Sami work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Despite its widespread use, the word "gypsy" is considered offensive, especially by non-Romani people, through its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
consultations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The visuals presented are crisp, comprehensive, and highly simplified compared to other more detailed information.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather that causes damage, significant social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on land, and there are many types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones are forms and effects of severe weather, as are strong winds, snow, extreme precipitation, and wildfires.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, ice storms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any hazards affecting their surroundings as severe weather could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that might be considered a war zone should get professional training.
An Internet search for "hazardous environment education" may turn up the address of a local company.
The course typically covers all of the topics described here in great detail, often with hands-on experience.
The course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes minigames, lots of first aid, and sometimes military training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but those dealing with war zones are few.
Airports planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have the correct documentation for onward travel.

Re-entry shock comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture may sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own.
when you return home after living abroad, you have adjusted to a new culture and have lost some of your home culture.
when they first visited a foreign land, they were likely patient and understanding, for they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
people also fail to appreciate the need for patience and understanding on the part of travelers returning home.
