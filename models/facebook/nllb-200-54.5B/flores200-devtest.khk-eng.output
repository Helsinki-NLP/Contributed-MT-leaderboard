Once the voter's identity has been verified by the authorities, the voter puts a stamp in the ballot box and signs the list of names of people entitled to vote.

Candidates can send their delegates to witness every part of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by a highly supervised team of volunteers according to a specific procedure.

This is a common practice in some parts of England, but in Scotland, where justice is administered differently, the courts have ruled that the publication of the photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: "Journalists are walking a fine line when they publish photographs of dead bodies".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the investigation, told reporters that it would not comment until at least an announcement had been made.
This document, as it turns out, deals with a border dispute that the Palestinians want based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues of concern include the future of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, both of which are integral parts of the two-state solution.
If the treaty is signed, Israel demands to station armed forces in the valley for ten years, while the PA agrees to abandon such combat conditions for only five years.
Additional cases of agricultural pesticide control will be monitored and evaluated by the forest police, so that the wise shooters in this case will be closely supervised by the forest police.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Goods Association of Australia (NSW), skilled volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Goods Association Scholarship Programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Comparative Heritage at the UNCCD, the four archers selected for the first landing operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by the newly formed nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEC).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission suggested that the resignation of the Bermuda-based Independent Commission of Inquiry be part of a package of measures to move the country in a new direction.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in August.
Some violent protests have resulted from the failure to hold elections that have occurred since 2011.
There are reports of up to 60 faulty iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had 34 cases of what it called "non-serious" overheating.
When the State Department delayed Apple's report, they said, "We're very sorry".
The earthquake struck at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no immediate reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer stopped a group of Hong Kong tourists from boarding a bus bound for the capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and six are confirmed dead.
Among the first to be released from the six barriers, which included children and the elderly, were Filipino photographers.
A photographer later took a picture of an elderly woman's apartment in need of a restroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in her spare time.
Her research has shown that if you give a hormone, it can accelerate the growth of the fetal egg.
Government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Tuesday, Xinhua reported.
Her fellow monks also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. Luna was my first manager. Luna died the night of the two-month anniversary.
Dustin "Goldrush" Russell wrote, "Luna was as bad a person as I was...maybe even better...you will love her and miss her...hope she went to a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, the percentage who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled also want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
On the extreme end of the spectrum, 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events in three events at the Commonwealth Games, but her training is questionable, according to her application.
Because of the suspension, he was unable to take the medication he needed to ease his pain.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, announced the discovery of the largest known prime number.
In early February, a bunch of people using different hardware and software validated it, and on Tuesday, they announced it.
Together with the organic matter that makes up the rocks and supports life, the moons could be a conduit for Earth's water supply.
Since the last star collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the series "political gibberish and nonsense".
In 2016, he is projected to run for president.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that NextGen would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
This system will use satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, and will allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport has been made available, and open trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and drop-off vehicles are not permitted in the area.
The fear of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the tournament would be played behind closed doors and without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that although they believe the process took much longer, the Darwin's firefly and the migrating cactus firefly from Geospiza Castle were able to reproduce, so the new species evolved over just two generations.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes, it can be flattened into little figures.
It can be dragged around as a thin wire that can be twisted and folded, and it can also be knocked around or crumpled like a piece of paper.
It can be made so thin that it can be glued to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called chemical pH, and you can make an indicator using a beaker.
Depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is, the glass changes color.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron.
The two dry ingredients are mixed together with clean hands and then pressed into the shape of a ball.
The fluid on your hand reacts to the outside layer, and it feels weird, and it forms a kind of crust.
Nearly every home in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had running water connected to a modern sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses on Crete and on Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese also had baths, and in Roman civilization, baths were a part of public hot springs where men and women bathed together.
When you're talking to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up your call and interprets it back to you almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere deflects some of the light.
A rocket big enough to launch a satellite or a telescope into space would have to go 100 feet higher.
The bicycle has changed the world in amazing ways, but the biggest thing it's given us is a lighter, faster mode of transportation.
This has given us trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
After that, there are the more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from beaks to ears to throats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet cats) that eat a large number of small prey such as rabbits, otters, pigeons, and birds.
The secret to their success was the concept that each cat was a secret agent with a special job to do without competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
Sculptures range from one to three adult male lions and tigers to females and bamboos.
Females are often closely related to each other, forming a large group of females.
A pride of lions is surprisingly similar in behavior to a pride of wolves or dogs (but not other big cats) and poses a deadly threat to its prey.
The ultimate athlete, a pole-vaulter -- not great, but he's a pole-vaulter -- can shoot long distances and pull objects with five times the force of a strong man.
The bar is in the same genus as the lion, the leopard, and the yellow-billed parrot.
The roar of the lion's roar is not the roar of a lion's roar, but the roar of angry, screaming words in sentences.
The great apes like to eat small animals, and they'll catch monkeys and snakes and lizards and birds if they can, and almost anything the great apes catch is much smaller than that.
Scientists believe that the ocelot uses its sense of smell to locate and eat prey.
They have very good night vision, they can move very quietly, and they're very clever rabbits that can adjust their coloration to their environment to catch prey by surprise.
When a subpopulation of a species (of which there are a few) moves away from its parent species (to a new area, river basin, or island and cannot return), they often have to adapt to a different environment than before.
As this new environment has different resources and different competitors, the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become stronger competitors than what was needed before.
The basic population has not changed at all and still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, over thousands or millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process of formation of new things speciation, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and take in the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also make shade.
We use plants to make our houses, we use plants to make our clothes, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, none of our animals could live.
Mosasaurs were the top predators of their time, and they weren't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
It has a long tail with 70 sharper canines, and it has an extra mouth at the end, so anything that gets in its way seems to have nowhere to go.
We don't know exactly what it was, but it probably had a forked tongue, and it probably ate a diet of squid, large fish, and other crustaceans, and it probably ate its own kind.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, including a giant dinosaur, T. rex, that didn't belong in the water.
Many of the foods of the Romans are familiar to us, but they also shared some strange or unusual foods, such as wild mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, and a type of mushroom called wild yam.
There was another difference, which was that the poor people and the women would sit on chairs and eat, while the rich men would sit together and eat and cook.
The ancient Roman diet did not include foods that would come to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat pearls, onions, tomatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted ice cream.
The Babylonians built elaborate temples to their gods, each of whom they viewed as a separate deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by holding festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only worshipers could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of the temples.
At the top of the tower was a shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not important.
Much of Jewish family life centered on the outdoors.
The women cooked in their backyards, the shops were open porches facing the street, and the houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce and costly.
Greenland is sparsely settled, and it's said in Norse mythology that Erik the Red found Greenland on his journey west from Iceland, and named it Greenland because of his hunting expedition.
Despite his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different people, kings, customs and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably think of the treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
It's not a treasure map, although there is something written on the back of the document.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "First Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", written upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows who wrote it, but it is known that this large document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally kept as a secret.
So the notes are simply added to each character.
D-Day and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French who made friends with the Germans in the 1940s and collaborated with the Germans instead of fighting the occupiers.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Desert Storm.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people or societies who live and work together.
Civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, and describes the extent of a society in some way.
The design of the city is a sign of the people, and the culture of a civilization means the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural heritage, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Minority cultures often disappear without any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government due to the composition of Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to tax because it lacked a national executive or judicial branch and relied on uncooperative state governments to enforce laws.
It didn't have the power to override interstate tax laws or tariffs.
Amendments to the treaty required the unanimous consent of all the states, and because the states accepted the federal government too lightly, their representatives were often left without power.
The Italy national football team is the joint second most successful national football team in the world after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Included are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, curling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, bicycle hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
The Japanese occupy almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often called the "Group of Islands" due to its geographical location.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and set out to change the hill country's cultivation practices by hiring Chinese laborers for its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of the southern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Chinese Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Chinese government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, including the Temple of the Sun, or Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order to give visitors a better idea of what it originally looked like, most of the structures at the entrance of the complex were built.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common motion picture format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size until the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is used in the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, so it's kind of dizzying in some ways.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are roughly equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often shaded and sub-shaded, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining the size of the sequence in the image.
The most effective part for the main subject is at the intersection where the image is divided into three by the triangle and the circle (see example).
At that time in European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church were being challenged.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united Europeans of different languages and cultures.
From the cradle to the grave, it had a profound effect on everyone.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church coffers are special for that reason.
The Church has been headquartered in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether that belief is true.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, the British launched a naval blockade of Germany.
Cutting off vital military and civilian supplies has been done over the last two centuries and violates several international treaties that have been agreed upon, but the strategy has proven to work.
Britain mined international waters, preventing ships from entering any part of the sea, and threatened neutral shipping.
The response to this tactic was limited, and the Germans anticipated a similar response to their submarine warfare in the Mediterranean.
Throughout the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of many people and nations.
After witnessing the violence and horrors of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former employer, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods; each period or dynasty in China had its own politics.
There was a period of instability when the country was divided into provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these generations, fierce battles were fought between various clans fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying for a high seat in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
There are enormous social and political implications of using the metric system, of moving from absolute monarchy to nationalism, of moving from patriarchy to a state ruled by the people and not by one person.
After the change, all jobs were open to male applicants, and only the most ambitious and successful were allowed to succeed.
In the military, it's the same thing, because instead of rank being based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in life beyond this world, and he often went to bathe in a cave in a mountain called Hira.
Sitting in the cave, which has survived to this day, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's interest in spirituality.
It's on the side of a mountain behind Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In the real world, we know these things exist, but they're not easy to find, and once you're in the tank, you're completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the beautiful blue sky and the surrounding mountains, and you can see and hear very little of the world below.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., was one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, or Giza Necropolis, on the Giza side of Egypt's Valley of Death, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), small caves, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-facing cup" looks like a V, and the "downward-facing cup" looks like a triangle or a square with a raised bottom.
Up means you pull the book from the spine, and down means you pull the book from the spine.
Those looking up tend to make softer sounds, while those looking down tend to make louder, more energetic sounds.
Make your own notes, but since the quotation marks are related to music, they should be considered together.
Frightened King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, their two young children - 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles - and the king's niece, Elizabeth, were marched from Versailles to Paris by a mob of children on August 6, 1789.
Surrounded by a howling mob shouting threats against the king and queen, they traveled back to Paris in a rickety car.
The mob forced the king and the queen to leave the windows of their carriage open for the crash.
At one point, a member of the group held the severed head of the King, who had been murdered at Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
American imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines was being paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were taxed to pay for much of the cost of U.S. colonial rule, and the interest on Philippine government bonds flowed freely through Wall Street banks.
And of course, the super profits from the long-term oppression of the Filipino people were the primary revenue stream for US imperialism.
To understand the loop, you have to understand the idea that inspired the sequence.
The era in which the events take place, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC), is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history.
The High Middle Ages is the period between the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses the broader practical idea that human destiny follows a logical path related to the laws of science and their technological expression, starting from the motivation or importance of technology.
Most translations of the definition of technology share two general ideas: that technology progresses independently of cultural or political influences, and that technology "represents" a society in which it is rational rather than informally conditioned.
You could say, for example, that the motor led to the development of the road, which led inevitably to the development of the road.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new methods of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Increased car ownership leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, and it also leads to the development of new medical care technologies to repair human injuries.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural definition, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and their interactions with society over time, creating customs and cultures associated with that geography rather than rules set by lore.
Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, while Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The city was famed as the epicenter of a flourishing civilization that began about 400 B.C.E. and lasted until about 1100 B.C.E.
The city's status declined in the tenth century, as crusaders returned with gifts of silver and spices more valuable than what the Byzantine market could offer.
It was during this time that the capital of fashion was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century, the Gothic style reached its peak.
Initially, Byzantine influence was strong in the West.
However, the communication channels were slow, so the western style was 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to shorten their shirts.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted for the sole purpose of producing food that is sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Transgenic agriculture is a simple, often organic and ecologically sound system of maintaining native plant seeds, combined with fertilization or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded people who feel excluded by social norms and allows them to develop as individuals.
Subcultures can be unique in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location, and gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination thereof.
Members of a subculture often express styles in unique and symbolic ways, including patterns, methods, and personal language.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider a few cases of orphaned children who were not socialized as they grew up, either because they were neglected, neglected, or deliberately humiliated by adults.
Some naughty children were abandoned by people (often their own parents); in some cases, abandonment was due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental and physical disabilities.
Abused children are more likely to have experienced child abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others are said to have been introduced by animals; some even live in the wild.
When a child is raised by a non-human animal, the child raised in the wild will almost certainly exhibit the animal's fear and lack of affection.
Project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, whereas grading is taking it a step further.
Chess is not a method of learning, but rather a support for people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The hierarchy can be virtual or physical, which means that the teacher is a hierarchy, but there's a little paper man who works in a Microsoft office.
Virtual classrooms are placed inside the software to ask and explain procedures that students may find difficult to work with on their own.
Children enter foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even assault.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where they're not nurtured and cared for and educated, and yet, here we are.
We think of the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, caring caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
The goal of foster care is to meet the needs of children who have not been met by their previous families.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The differentiated nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and paradigms.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as important topics for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Personal involvement and "persistence relationships" were also identified as a new dimension of activation by Eggemey and McCord (1998) when studying user responses to Web sites.
The use of video has led to a major breakthrough in the interpretation of microexpressions, or facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting facial expressions, we can detect when someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, describes how people who have lost the ability to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He suggested that a similar ability to interpret human behavior could be shared by domestic animals, such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation, implicit and explicit.
A mutation is a new version of a gene that adds an option to remove it from the expression pool.
There's a need to redistribute and redistribute and redistribute and redistribute and redistribute between the watersheds.
When you go to the savannah, it's hard for a body with a digestive system like ours to get all the vitamins it needs from a plant source.
And failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant-based resources are algae and fungi, which have plant-based minerals, but they're hard to digest unless you use them in a dish like ours.
On the other hand, animal foods (shrimp, prawns, eggs) provide high amounts of minerals that are not only easily digested but also contain all the essential nutrients.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors dealt with the problem of deforestation in ways that are similar to the way primates deal with the problem of deforestation in tropical forests today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally staying awake during a normal sleep period and then falling asleep for short periods (10-60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using your relatively quiet waking hours to bring your consciousness fully into awareness.
If you find that you're sleeping with the clock ticking, moving the clock to the other side of the room can encourage you to get up and go to sleep.
Other bio-based methods include forcing yourself to drink or chew a lot of liquids (especially water or tea with a diuretic) before bedtime.
The degree to which a person achieves inner peace has been compared to physical and mental effort.
The less tolerant we are, the more positive our life force is, and the greater our capacity for peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands between us and that goal is our own efforts and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but enriched by the way of the great vessel of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: Kundalini yoga, purity and the path of compassionate love for all.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mindfulness and visualization, the Kundalini yoga and the Kundalini energy are revived.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Complete Enlightenment, which involves visualizing various deities to cleanse the energy channels, activate the vessels, and create enlightened consciousness.
Germany was the main enemy in World War II, which led the Soviet Union and the United States to become allies, and when the war ended, the system collapsed, and the process and the culture split the countries.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become bitter enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
As the Cold War dragged on for the next 40 years, it was assumed that active-duty armies would fight for real in many different places, from Africa to Asia to Afghanistan to Cuba.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were so exhausted that their only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and regroup.
After the Soviet Union occupied the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties in both bilingual and multilingual, these plans became unnecessary almost overnight, as 800,000 more Red Army troops moved in and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is probably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to match the enemy's ability to move men and supplies, as opposed to ensuring that their country can move men and supplies.
The most famous recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to send their troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
The German Navy, which at the time was predominantly using U-boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had lost, Germany, which had occupied the rest of Europe, could have invaded Britain.
Yams were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes raised camels for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually herded into a pen or other enclosure, and usually a child or adolescent goatherd, more commonly known as a shepherd, answered the call.
Wagonways were first built in England in the 16th century.
Even though the wagon tracks consisted of parallel bridges, it allowed the horses to go faster and carry heavier loads over slightly rougher terrain.
Railroad spans were used early on to build roads on the ground, but later it was realized that railroad spans were more efficient.
This was a common practice, but the wooden wheels of the wagons were much better welded than the iron.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels, and in 1767 the first complete railway was inaugurated.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and it wasn't until Homo erectus evolved that humans started walking upright about two million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, were not used to walking upright.
The earliest known bipedal species is the 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's just a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a quick fix, we need to get to the root of the problem and deactivate that root.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems are worsening because of overpopulation and mankind's increasingly sedentary lifestyle.
After Congress enacted it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed of what is now known as the Dunlap Papers.
It was first read on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8 by President John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops on July 9th.
The 25 known copies of the first edition of the Declaration of Independence are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
People don't think of themselves as dinosaurs just because they can fly and fly and fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T. rex.
In fact, all the computers we use today are based on the complexity of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer language.
Inflammation may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as swelling, may be general enough to preclude an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of indoor poisoning may be a container of medicine or toxic chemicals in the home.
Check the label to see if there is a specific first-aid kit for your cell.
The term wasp is used by entomologists to formally refer to this family of wasps.
The term is derived from an ancient association with the honeybee, a parasitic insect that lives on human blood.
Killer whales and porpoises live in colonies and are adapted to live in nests or houses in their native habitat.
With approximately 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, it is the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the sense of sight.
One study found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to have a child.
These couples may choose to plan to have children.
In a surrogacy arrangement, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The whole point of science is to find out how the world works through scientific investigation, and this evidence-based approach is the most scientific investigation.
It's not the only thing, but running an experiment, an experiment is the process of eliminating one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, making observations, and conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were especially interested in selected texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted all of Aristotle's ideas about all of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many of the observed patterns of physiology and behavior are dependent on endogenous cycles, their production by the biological clock.
More than a simple response to external cues, circadian rhythms have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining signal that keeps cycling freely even when there is no external clock.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key experiments that suggested DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a fungus or a virus to insert their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in feces with radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur from feces.
Depending on the significance of the mutated genetic region in the cell, and whether the mutated cell is a bacterial cell or not, there are different effects.
Only the mutations in the bacterial cell can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the phenomenon that includes plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of field activities include camping, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
One example is visiting Borneo and taking pictures and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people in small urban communities get in their cars and drive to work, and they're met by other people who have jobs in the area that they just left.
In this dynamic transportation plane, everyone is connected in some way, supporting a personal car-based transportation system.
This giant carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of its sustainable zone and supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everybody participates in society, everybody uses the transportation system, and almost everybody complains about the transportation system.
In the developed world, you'll occasionally hear similar complaints about the quality of the water or a collapsing bridge.
Why do transportation systems fail to deliver the basics of everyday life, like generating suggestions? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement and interaction of people and vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it doesn't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, because drivers operate in a relatively stable environment, the flow of traffic tends to be relatively stable and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships are established between three basic parameters: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) frequency.
These relationships inform the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
The first animals to take to the air were birds, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to conquer their enemies, find food, and reproduce more efficiently.
Most dragonflies have the advantage of being able to fold their wings to accommodate their large bodies.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only birds that cannot retract their wings are storks and herons.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Although some people believed that he was correct, many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and other stars), revolved around the earth.
It's possible because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it has eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of glaciers.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but they were never surpassed by the Giza pyramids in terms of their size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egypt's New Kingdom was dominated by monuments from earlier kingdoms that were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the province, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since it occurs naturally and is relatively easy to extract with simple tools, people knew about the basic elements, such as gold, silver, and early copper.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: dust, water, air, and fire.
Although he also theorized that these could change into new substances to create the things we see, this was similar to the four basic states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma (in that order).
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have a mixture that has a small amount of a non-metallic element, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that atoms the size of supernovas could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, he became a good friend to many during his formative years.
Sadly, the use of ink declined as new writing methods became available.
Now that people are typing on computer screens, viewers never have to get up close again.
I wonder what's going to happen to the computer arm when something new comes along.
An atomic bomb works by using a large number of protons and neutrons to expend energy to fuel the nucleus of an atom.
It's like lifting a heavy weight off the ground, and then when you split the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to orbit with little or no propulsion.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer is called the surface.
It's about 70 kilometers wide on the near side and 100 kilometers wide on the far side.
In the lowlands, it is thinner, and in the highlands, it is narrower.
Because the crust is thinner, it can be more bumpy on the near side, and it's easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people tick and what gets their attention.
These theories assume that there are certain desires and/or needs that are inborn and fixed in humans from adulthood.
These theories are about specific people who want to do what they want to do and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory have two common themes.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that occur when managers start to outperform their peers, and one of them is that they try to remain one of the boys.
This type of manager has trouble making unfamiliar decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an outsider who believes everything your team does should be different and should be your own.
Ultimately, the success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This behavior creates a barrier between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but with a slight difference.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for the real group they interact with directly.
They have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
Having a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) would be a unique component of a virtual team.
In a management team, the invisible team is the group to which each member reports, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
Creativity and innovation flourish when all available resources are used effectively across the organization's functional departments.
As a result, organizations working together to overcome obstacles can lead to innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help an organization achieve high levels of performance.
Neuroscientific data provide evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, which is why it makes the field of study more precise and specific.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior has inspired scientific research.
We've known for a long time that various brain injuries, mental illnesses, injuries and cancers cause changes in certain brain functions that affect behavior.
New technologies are increasingly allowing us to see and study structures and processes in the brain in ways we never could before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong predictive value, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and machine intelligence.
Research at SOAS involves automating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to user diagnostics and questions, and the ability to produce handwritten text, voice and facial expressions.
Those things become separate principles focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems used in several home computer and video game software applications are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom, and teachers often like to take their students to places where they might not otherwise choose to go by bus.
The technology offers a solution for virtual fabrication exercises, where students can see museum displays, visit an aquarium, or sit in their classrooms and admire beautiful art.
Going on a virtual field trip together is a great way to understand and share the journey with your classmates in the future.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year they redesign the website, but keep the old version online as a pet.
Blogging helps students to improve their writing skills. The student blogging experience starts with rules and grammar mistakes, which are usually changed by their readers.
Students are the most problematic audience, so bloggers start trying to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to "become more aware of the world around them". The need to match the audience's interests motivates students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and empowers students to push learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs as a medium "supports students to become more analytical and critical by actively responding to Internet material, students are able to identify their own position in the context of other people's videos, and learn to identify their own position on certain issues" (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant, bilingual capital city and is known for its art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You've got Niagara Falls to the south, you've got Muskoka County to the north, and beyond that, pristine wilderness.
All of these things and many other things about Ontario are unique to Canada to outsiders.
Large areas of the Northeast are sparsely populated, and some areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that many people might find surprising is that there are more African Americans living in the United States than in Canada.
The East African archipelago is in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent in the world that has its own wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the area and heavily influenced the course of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Any female traveler is advised to say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
And folding is helpful -- it's not expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can be seen as offensive, and that things like following and holding hands are not uncommon.
Be confident in rejecting men's advances and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badiya, and Spanish merchants who built their meeting barracks there renamed the city Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods for tourists, including tajine bowls, vases, leather goods, bankai, and a wide range of fine leather goods.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the eastern border of Rwanda.
In 2002 the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, destroying Goma and burying most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip out of Goma requires understanding and studying the fighting conditions in North Kivu.
It is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, the cheapest route to the Gorilla Mountains in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative invulnerability, Timbuktu has been used as a metaphor for a remote and isolated place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it's still a popular tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
This was one of the stops on a BBC special called Wonders of the African World, starring Henry Louis Gates.
It's very different from the rest of the country because it's more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Matari River forming the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a distinct wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the most beautiful of South Africa's National Parks (SANPs).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation works and an entrance fee to the park.
It may be helpful for anyone to purchase a Green Card, which gives access to South African parks, or the option of entering all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong and is a major destination for many tourists.
The list of skyscrapers in Hong Kong is compared to the shimmering figure in the water of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, go around the island and aim for the harbor district on the opposite side.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has been in the dense reed beds of the reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the land that the British colonists claimed as their own, and it's a good place to go if you're looking for evidence of a colonial past in the region.
The Sundarbans is the largest area of mangrove coastline in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Bangladesh to the inner coast of India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Although there are some last remnants of the dense forest that once covered the Gangetic plain, this forest is much more than a forest canopy.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, one third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a dense wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and over 30,000 tigers.
Buses run throughout the day from bus stops within the district (out of the river valley), but most go east to Jakhar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
The inter-district bus is usually full, so it is recommended to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small buses of the Japan Coast, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shuttle taxis are fast and convenient for travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River between the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters and have two wings 378 meters long and 3.50 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay - then known as the "Great State of the Indies" - emerged from the clash between Spanish conquistadores and local tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous image and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller competitions can be found here and at other times of the year.
For information on the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo match, see Argentine Polo Federation.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is similar in value to the British pound sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank on the island, which is in Stanley, just down the street from FIC West.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar are also widely accepted.
In remote islands, you may be able to accept British or U.S. currency, but credit cards are not accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer here, and when it's summer there, it's winter here.
Montevideo is a hot city, with temperatures often reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] in the summer.
Winters can be deceptively warm: temperatures are below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "wet" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Many of the animals in zoos are used to humans seeing them, but wildlife is still wild by nature, and we can't feed them or disturb them.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards away from foxes and jackals and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how unpredictable they may seem, they are capable of attacking almost any large animal, including lizards, crocodiles, cheetahs, and monkeys.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they don't have proper space, and these animals can be big and wild and dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, because the scent attracts deer and other wildlife, we avoid carrying or preparing food that smells good and we keep our surroundings clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was the site of a famous transatlantic standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese III Lealofi.
Auckland is sandwiched between two harbours, so there are lots of sunbathing spots, but the three most popular are:
The Northern Harbour District is a region of the North Sea stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy sunbathing areas with safe shelter, often shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive sunbathing sites are located on Waitemata Harbour, Mission Bay and in the upmarket district of the town of Mount Helier in North Auckland.
They become sunny spots along the coast, with good shopping, full of families, safe for swimming.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a sophisticated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There's a lot of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are much better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, "flavourless, white" coffee is a distant relative, and "small black" is an espresso that is a cappuccino served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality, and the fruit juice is expensive, but delicious.
Expeditions to underwater caves are made many times a year and are rarely injured by underwater rocks.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all traffic signals, and heed all safety warnings.
The loggerhead sea turtle was present in coastal and river waters from October to April 1770, but was rarely seen at other times.
Although there are giant fish, they rarely attack humans. Most giant fish are fearful of humans and stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, and their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but through a travel agent you can book other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agents often offer breakfast, transportation from and to the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the proposal or to buy other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa), they can also wait for your order.
Any changes or requests for proposals must first be coordinated with the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most of the music festival attendees decide to stay at the venue, and most of the attendees consider it necessary.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to find a place to stay that's close to the music.
Even if the music stops on the main stage, there may be parts of the festival where the music continues until midnight.
Some festivals have special tents for families with small children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in the winter, check the position of the panels, because they make a very dangerous noise when they're frozen.
St. Petersburg cruises include a period of stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the background).
Casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They often have special arrangements for food, drink, and entertainment to make guests feel welcome and to give them a sense of permanence.
Some places offer alcohol, although alcohol tends to dull the senses, so most good players know the importance of staying healthy.
Anyone planning to drive on high ground or up a mountain must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On ice and snow, there's less friction, so you don't drive as well as you would on dirt roads.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to send you back.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall, sleet, vehicle windows being blocked, and ice on the ground.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows largely unimpeded year-round.
Safaris are a great tourist attraction in Africa, and many travelers are attracted to them.
The word "safari" is generally used to describe a journey into the wilds of Africa, especially the tropics.
Some animals, such as rabbits and deer, tend to move closer to the car, and you can get a better view with standard equipment.
Lions, leopards and zebras are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better in the twilight.
A safari walk (also called a "boot walk", "safari walk" or "walk") consists of walking for several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo hosted the Games in 1964, making it the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you had already booked your flights and accommodations for your 2020 trip before the extension was announced, you are in the clear.
While the cancellation policy is different, most coronavirus-based cancellations from late March will not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics would have taken place.
Tickets for most events range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket estimated to be around 7,000 yen.
Dirty clothes are dried with an iron, and many hotels have iron and drying tables, although these are not available in the rooms.
If you don't have a comb, and you don't like to wear a comb, try using a hair comb if you can.
Be careful not to overheat the pan (otherwise it will burn and become extremely hot).
There are many different ways to purify water, and some may be more effective against certain threats.
In some places, it takes only a minute to turn the water back on, while in others it takes several minutes.
Refrigerators are known for their efficiency, and if you're worried about that, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter poisonous creatures unknown in their homeland.
Hormones can contaminate food, causing seizures, or worse, triggering an allergic reaction, which can lead to poisoning and infection.
Dangerous animals that are capable of transmitting disease or inflicting serious injury or death to humans are usually not considered pests.
A duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy special or other tax-exempt goods at a specific location.
Travelers to high-tax countries can save considerable amounts of money, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the roughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, with frequent incursions into the backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, remember that bumps, sharp curves, and twists can be treacherous.
The posted speed limit is noticeably lower than that of the front and rear sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is more important to adhere to this speed.
But what's amazing is that the cell service here is stronger than many of the other destinations along the route, like the wilds of Pennsylvania.
German cuisine is very good, and Bavaria has a very rich and varied cuisine, similar to that of its southern neighbour Austria.
Throughout the year, thin bowls are common, with fruit made by twisting apples in thin bowls, and in the summer, indoor and outdoor bowls are made in thin bowls.
Many elaborate bowls made in Germany contain oak, maple, and other tree sap. Popular cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich gourmet meal, try the Berliner, Pannkuchen or Krappen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the scale of freshness, curry can be "dry" or "fresh".
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, taro is widely used in curries; in the coastal regions of South India and the subcontinent, coconut juice is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses many different regional cuisines throughout the country.
When used without qualifiers, the term refers to food originating from the eastern and central parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now available throughout the archipelago, consists of simple savoury dishes, and Javanese favourite flavours include ground pepper, red chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of spicy hot vegetables.
The back supports the rider's legs, and there are ribs on each side of the chest.
They provide a great deal of stability for the rider, but the rider's feet are at risk of tripping over them, so safety warnings are needed.
If a rider falls off a horse and breaks his leg, he can be bitten by the horse. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most of the riders wear high-heeled, spiked, very elaborate, specialized shoes.
Some cats, especially English cats, have a safety harness with a piece of skin that slips off when they pull back on a falling leash.
The Cochamo Valley, the birthplace of Chilean mountaineering, is the Yosemite of South America, with large walls and ridges of various types of limestone.
The summits have a magical appearance, and climbers from all over the world are constantly carving new paths through the limitless possibilities of their walls.
Alpine skiing, including skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing or snowboarding on snow-covered ground.
Many enthusiasts, sometimes called "snowbirds", plan an entire vacation to ski at a particular location, so skiing is the main activity of the trip.
The idea of scuba diving is very old, and there are cave paintings of people scuba diving that date back to 5,000 BC.
Ski mountaineering dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Endurance skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
Alpine skiing or mountaineering are not usually included, but are related, and subsequent activities done on steeper terrain required stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trip as being similar to a hiking trip.
In good conditions, you can cover a lot more ground than you can on foot, but in terms of cross-country speed, you can get there by simply walking up the paved trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and in normal circumstances, travelling between countries means applying for a visa multiple times and going through passport control multiple times.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area operates in this respect more or less like a single country.
Once you are in this zone, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member state, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a manufactured item as an antique, and some customs agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.
In places like North America, the age limit can be lower than in Europe, so the definition has geographical variations.
Handcrafted items can be described as antiques, even if they are younger in age than similar mass-produced items.
Paper farming is an important part of the Sami people's way of life, and the culture of trading is also important to many other professions.
Traditionally, all Sami people did not engage in large-scale reed farming, but lived by fishing, weaving and using reed mostly as livestock.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sápmi.
It is especially widespread among non-Romanians, as the word "gypsy" is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are going to is the subject of a travel information bulletin, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want the advice of other governments, but their advice is for their citizens.
As just one example, Americans in the Middle East face a different set of circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
