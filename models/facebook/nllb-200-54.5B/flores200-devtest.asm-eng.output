Not only does this provide certainty that at least some dinosaurs had birds, a theory already widespread, but pterosaur fossils generally do not, such as coloration and 3-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have suggested that the animal's plumage may have been light brownish purple or a yellowish-orange on the underside.
The findings also shed light on the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur wings don't have well-developed jaws, they're called vertebrae, but birds have some other features -- fins and scales -- that researchers say, like other features, evolved later.
The structure of the bird suggests that these were not used for flight but for thermal control or display. The researchers also suggest that although this is a juvenile dinosaur's nose, the specimen does not look as juvenile as an adult bird.
The researchers reported that although the nose belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the samples showed adult birds rather than juvenile birds.

Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in at the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended early CEP registration as part of efforts to move the country towards fresh elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that have been going on since October.
Prevention of violations to keep the elections in hand sometimes fails, some have been going on since 2011.

In a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 general election, the number of people who did not want Australia to be a democracy increased by 8% since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a democracy at the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled said Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Voter turnout was extremely low, with 29% believing that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never become a republic.

No additional transport services are provided and the underground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking or parking and driving facilities.
Fears of reduced traffic increased the likelihood that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without team support.
An article about the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands was published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden claim that the new species evolved in only 2 generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer due to breeding between a native Darwin's bird, Geospiza fortis, and a migratory cactus bird, Geospiza coniferostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of things.
It can be stretched into thin wires, which can be folded and flattened, which can be folded again, or it can be made into a sheet.
"It can be made very thin, and coated with other metals. It is made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate handmade illustrations in books, called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This is called acidity in chemistry. An indicator can be made from the juice of red cabbage.
The colour of the bond changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
Typically, the amount of hydrogen ions present in a tested chemical determines its acidity level.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (because hydrogen atoms have 1 proton and 1 electron).
"Take two dry balls and beat them together and then, with a clean sharp hand, shape them into flat balls".""
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel moist and form cells.
Almost every house in the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had an elaborate latrine connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of the plumbing system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
"A satellite in space receives a message and then reflects it back immediately".""
The satellite was launched aboard a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and images.
It takes a giant rocket to a height of about 100 feet to place satellites or telescopes in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing is that the wheel has brought us easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other transportation devices.
They are dominated by medium-sized cats ranging from tigers to foxes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including small domestic cats) that eat a multitude of small prey such as moths, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the trench concept, a special task that keeps each ant from competing with the others.
"Lions are the most social cats, living in large packs called prides".""
In a pride of lions there are about thirty females, including males and cubs aged 1 to 3 years.
Women are usually closely related to them.
Lion's claws are almost identical to those of foxes and dogs, and significantly more similar to those of other lions (except big cats), and can be very lethal to prey.
A good athlete, the tiger can bark (though not well), swim, jump considerable distances, and pull eight times as much as a strong man.
Tigers (genus Panthera) are in the same group as lions, rhinoceroses, and jaguars. Only these four species of cats are able to roam.
The roar of the tiger is not like that of a lion but like that of a roaring lion.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals. If they can swim they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than this.
Scientists think that octopuses follow and search for food by sniffing the animals from their ground position.
They have night vision, and are very stealthy. The ocelot adapts to its surroundings and then hunts with a hammer.
When a small group of organisms (a subpopulation) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which there is no easy return) they find themselves in a different environment than before.
In the new environment, there are different ways and different competitors, so the new people will need different specialties and they will have to accept stronger competitors than before.
The real population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they become increasingly different from other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is the result of an essential function and is a very necessary part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from trees and we make our clothes from trees. Most of the food we eat comes from trees. Without trees, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was feared by none other than other mosasaurs.
Its long pair of teeth, with an extra set in the palate, had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, meaning it had no margin for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it was probably a forked tongue. Its diet included shrimp, large fish, other mammals, and it may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant T-Rex.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Roman diet included some unusual ingredients, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and shellfish.
Another difference was that when the poor man and woman sat down to eat, the rich man preferred to relax and eat together.
Ancient Roman diets did not include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no beans, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
Babylon was built by their gods, a central temple that was considered the house of the gods.
People would make offerings to the gods and priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and inside were special places of worship where only worshipers could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples called ziggurats.
The top of the pillar was a special place for the Lord.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is not essential.
(Deuteronomy 6:6-9) The Israelites were commanded: "You must not take vengeance nor hold a grudge against the sons of your people".
Women do not work in the workplace; objects are in the open where they can be seen from the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland was settled by very few people. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, that he found Greenland and named it Greenland when he was travelling westward.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', Denmark, Sweden and Iceland had many differences in people, kings, laws and history.
If you saw the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Despite what it says on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read: "The date of the original Declaration of Independence is July 4, 1776". The words are written upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows exactly who wrote it, but it is known that large parchment documents (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) were rolled up for storage in its early days.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
At the end of D-Day and the war that followed, the northern half of France was liberated, but the southern half was not.
"It was ruled by the ""Vichy"" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together rather than fight the invaders".
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as ""Operation Dragoon""".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French armies liberated southern France and sided with Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civilized, related to the Latin citizen, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and defines the shape of a society.
The city-states are the guardians of the nation. A civilized culture has knowledge flowing through several generations, a long-lived cultural footprint, and adequate expansion.
Cultures of small populations sometimes disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are unable to identify a true civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, of which only Congress was a part under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress does not have the power to impose taxes, and since it has no national executive or judiciary, it relies solely on government authorities, who generally cooperate in enforcing all its laws.
It also had no authority to dispense with tax laws and duties between nations.
Before amending the article, they have to get agreement from all the states and the states hold the central government to a minimum so that their representatives are often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, along with Germany, and was the winner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter is more popular in the northern locations, where the Italian International Games and the Olympic Games are held.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
"Japan is often geographically referred to as an ""archipelago"" because of the islands that comprise it".""
It was not until the 15th century that European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up an outpost in Taiwan and employed Chinese farmers to cultivate rice and sugarcane in response to changes in local grain production.
In 1683, during the rule of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under its control, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Picchu, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the three Window Rooms.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been restored to give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of fish stocks had been recovered and the process is still ongoing.
For example, the world's most common still image format is 35mm, which was a dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio is derived from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat misleadingly, 24mm in height by 36mm in width.
The aspect ratio (divided by the bar to obtain the simplest integer ratio) of this format is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS-like formats) are identical or nearly identical to this aspect ratio.
The most abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics based on the scale of an image sequence.
It is said that the most effective space for the main content is between the three lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, which was then becoming wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, Christianity has united European kingdoms despite their different languages and cultures.
It was an all-pervading power that affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church coffers exist specifically for this reason.
The central administration of the Church has been in Rome for a thousand years, and the centralization of power and money raises questions about whether this doctrine has been upheld.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a new blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international norms, which had been codified in a number of international treaties over the previous two centuries.
The British dredged international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the sea, posing a threat to neutral shipping.
Since the response to the operation was limited, Germany hoped that the response to unrestricted submarine warfare would be similar.
In the 1920s, the mood of most countries and citizens was pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and brutality of World War I, the nations wanted to make sure that it would never happen again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, the editor of the earlier work.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the passage of time; each of China's stages, or ruling families, was an independent dynasty.
In addition, each dynasty had a turbulent period centered on divided provinces. The most well-known of this period was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days there was a tumultuous war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms, one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, saw tens of thousands of people die to ascend the throne of the Xiang dynasty.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from secularism to democracy, nationalism and the belief that a country belongs to its people, not to a single ruler.
While revolutionary professions were open to all male applicants, the most ambitious and worthwhile were allowed to succeed.
It's the same in the military because instead of ranking soldiers, they are now the basis of power.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in events other than his earthly life. He often visited a cave that later became known as Hira in the mountains of 'Pohr'.
"The cave, which survived the ravages of time, presents a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual interests".""
The cave, located on a mountain in northern Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it completely disintegrates.
From the cave, one can see only a small part of the world, with a beautiful clear sky and surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of the largest pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Phoenix".""
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the ruler Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wives and family members.
The ""up bow"" resembles the letter V and the ""down bow"" resembles a stapler or a square with no bottom".
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow and down means you have to start at the frog part and pull the bow.
An up-bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more forceful.
Write down your own numbers, but remember that the numbers printed are for the music, so they should be treated with respect.
The panicked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a group of women from the Versailles market.
A group of people with him, shouting threatening words against the king and queen, got into a burning carriage and returned to Paris.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave their shop windows wide open.
On one occasion, a member of the crowd waved the head of a murdered royal guard in front of the terrified queen at Versailles.
The cost of the U.S. administration's war to conquer the Philippines was borne by Filipinos.
They forced the U.S. to pay taxes to the colonial regime to cover a large part of the cost and taxes on bonds floated through Wall Street brokerage houses in the name of the Philippine government.
However, the Filipinos see the maximization of profits as a prolonged exploitation that is the main achievement of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the background that underpinned the creation of the Order.
The age in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technology determinism is a term that can have many practical meanings. Technology push or technological inevitability is the case that human destiny is governed by scientific laws and their technological expression.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general assumptions: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is essentially outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology has an inherent ""influence"" on society, rather than a socially controlled influence".""
For example, it can be said that the motor car drives the road to progress.
"However, a nationwide road network for only a few vehicles is not economically viable, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership".""
The large number of people owning private vehicles has increased the rate of road accidents, which has led to the development of new medical technologies to repair injuries.
Romanticism had many cultural elements, discussed by writers such as Goethe, Feist and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time geography shaped customs and cultures, and these were much better suited to fit into society's space than arbitrarily imposed rules.
In this context, Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, with Constantinople considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As a sub-centre of luxury, it became known around 400 AD and survived until around 1100 AD.
Its prestige declined from the 20th century mainly due to the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silks and spices, which were worth far more than the moles on the Byzantine market.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was spoken in the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by earlier Byzantine culture.
However, due to poor communication channels, the Western countries' style is 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europeans began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest developments during the period was as a result of the Crusades, when people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done solely to meet the minimum needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is often simple, usually organic and based on relatively simple methods to maximize yield with locally stored seeds.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been dependent on agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who have been marginalized by society and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
Some of the qualities that mark a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these elements.
Members of subcultures often express their culture through specific styles and symbolic styles that are expressed through fashion and etiquette.
One of the most common examples of the need for socialization is to draw attention to the unfortunate case of some boys who, as a result of neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, did not have any adult social relationships when they grew up.
"Such children are referred to as ""wild"" or feral. Some feral children are kept captive by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, such children are abandoned after being rejected by their parents because of intellectual or physical disabilities".""
Feral children are abused or traumatized before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are known to have been raised by animals; others are known to live on their own in the forest canopy.
When raised by a non-human animal, a feral child will have traits (including physical abilities) that are similar to that particular animal, such as its fearlessness or unlikelihood of interacting with humans.
Since project-based learning makes study easier and more enjoyable, add to it.
Modeling is not a method of learning but it is helpful for someone who is not a learner, for example when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be real or artificial. In common parlance, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, and the small paperclip in Microsoft Office is also a scaffold.
The Virtual Scaffold is given a role to ask questions through the software, give immediate answers and explain methods that are difficult for the learner to do alone.
Children were placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should ever have to grow up in a situation where they're not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they are.
We consider the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring nurses, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the essentials that were previously unavailable at home.
The Internet combines the principles of both collective and interactive communication.
The special features of the Internet are increased usability and satisfaction.
For example, 'education' and 'socialization' are some of the compelling reasons to encourage Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Aimee and McCord (1998) looked at audience reaction to the website, identifying ""personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as new motivating factors".
The use of video recording has led to some important innovations in the interpretation of small expressions lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is telling the truth or a lie by analyzing their subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain dysfunction are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that a similar ability to understand human behavior could come from animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research suggests that genetic variation has two aspects: latent and manifest.
Mutation creates a new mutant gene, and identification removes it from the pool of mutants it expresses.
Separation and recombination keep the mutation going back and forth between the two pools of two generations.
It is difficult for a mammal with a digestive system like humans in the savanna region to meet its amino acid requirements from the available vegetation.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and premature death.
The easiest protein to get from plants is protein from leaves and seeds, but we can't digest that.
Conversely, animal foods (cow, sheep, goat) are not only easily digestible, they also provide adequate amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their ""ancient problems"" more or less as well as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today".""
A sleep disorder is a pattern of voluntary awakening during normal sleep and then falling asleep for short periods of time (10-60 minutes).
A silent alarm clock makes it easier to wake up than to wake up completely.
If you reset your watch while sleeping, it can be moved to the other side of the room so that you don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biosimilar-based alternatives involve the consumption of liquids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) especially before bedtime, to induce one's tendency to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely related to his physical and mental stress.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality. Every person has the potential for complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of reaching that goal is stress and negative thinking.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but also extends to the Mahayana path of love and, to a considerable extent, Indian yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in its principles. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and love for all.
Kundalini Shakti (the power of learning) can be awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting of mantras and mental philosophy.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. The mental vision of various deities is said to purify the energy currents, activate the chakras and create a sense of bliss.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war the country was left with a clash of systems, processes and cultures.
"Within 2 years of the war's end, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began".""
It was going to go on for the next 40 years, and it was going to be fought, whether by proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, or in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses had already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup around the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight, when the Soviet Union's approximately 800,000-strong Red Army invaded Poland's former territories and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral or multilateral agreements.
Ships are the most efficient means of transporting a large number of people and goods by sea.
The function of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your movement of people and goods maintains your nation's capability, while, at the same time, hampering the enemy's movement of people and goods.
The most memorable recent example of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was attempting to interdict this traffic, mainly by using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain since it would have had the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably the first domesticated animal in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often supervised by a goat herder who was usually a child or adolescent, who was more widely known. This method of herding is still used today.
Wagonways were developed in England in the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted only of parallel strips of timber, they allowed the horses to increase the speed of the grind and to carry more weight in a day than the steep gravel roads.
In the early days, crosses were used to hold roads in place, but it was gradually realized that an iron wire would be more effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron stained the wooden wheels of the car even more.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. The first complete iron railway was built in 1767.
The first known transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk in a straight line.
Features of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, while Sahelanthropus walked on two legs by 7 million years ago.
We can start living green, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become an activist to reduce future consumption.
In many ways it's like targeted therapies. However, if you don't expect a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to disable them.
It is certain that the world is changing so much because of man's scientific and technological progress, and the problems are getting bigger because of the human population explosion and wasteful lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congressman John Hancock and editor Charles Thomson and taken to John Dunlop's printing shop a short distance away.
"Within a night, 150 to 200 had been built, known as the ""Dunlop broadsides""".
John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time at Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on July 10.
25 The Dunlop Broadside is the oldest known copy of this document. The original manuscript has been lost.
Many paleontologists still believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have hammers and well-shaped feet, they can chew, and they walk like a T-Rex with their hind legs bent.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information in some form of binary code.
Binary numbers can have only one of the digits 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits in computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are usually sufficient for immediate diagnosis.
A good indication of an internal sore may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular well.
Ornithologists use the term bug in a formal sense for these species of moths.
The term is derived from the ancient identity of the Urha, a parasitic species dependent on humans for survival.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are remarkably adapted to live in burrows or burrows in their nests.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 diagnosed cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the nerves in the brain, spinal cord, and eyes.
Research has shown that women are 2 times more likely to develop MS than men.
A couple can decide whether it is right for them or for their child to have a sibling.
These couples can plan for them to adopt identical children.
When adopting a child, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can have custody of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
And not only that, an experiment is an experiment that is conducted to test one or more hypotheses and that raises questions, studying the results to advance scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West distanced itself from Greek philosophical and scientific foundations.
Rhythms and behaviors observed in physiology are generally based on endogenous cycles and their creation by the biological clock.
Temporal rhythms, which are not responses to external temporal cues, have been documented for bacteria, fungi, plants and animals as well as most living organisms.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining vibrations that continue on a free-wheeling cycle in the absence of external cues.
In Hershey and Chase's experiments, DNA was one of the indicators of a hereditary factor theory.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
The DNA in the spores was labeled using radioactive phosphorus or the proteins were labeled using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the characteristic being that the genetic material can influence and the foreign cells can influence the cells.
Only mutations can transfer germ-line cells to the baby, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to natural areas for scenic purposes, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting gardens and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting Borneo and taking photos of orangutans and learning about them.
Every morning, people in small country towns drive to their workplaces and pass by commuters.
This progressive mobility vehicle is all about connecting and supporting the private vehicle-based transportation system.
Science is now indicating that this massive carbon economy is changing the very conditions of our biosphere that have supported human civilization for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation.
Similar complaints are heard regularly in developed countries about the quality of water or the collapse of dams.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more urgent going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is very difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, the use of drivers was reasonably good; therefore, the number of vehicles was reasonably constant and numerically countable.
To accurately represent the flow of traffic, three key attributes are correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and managing road facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape predators and find food and mates more easily.
Most moths have the advantage of being able to fold their hind wings with their body.
This gives them a wide berth to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot bite their own wings are moths and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was correct, but many thought otherwise; he said that the solar system, including the sun, revolved around the earth (as well as other stars).
You can feel it, can't you, that the Earth is spinning?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and widest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the next largest river.
At six miles wide, the Amazon is the world's widest river.
The Amazon receives 20 percent of the world's seawater.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids were decorated with stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never exceeded the limits in size and technical skill of construction.
The ancestral monuments of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt are amazing, dating back more than a thousand years.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest country in the world and one of the most sparsely populated.
Italian is used in Vatican City for legal and official purposes.
Italian was also used as a daily language by most of those working in the state, while Latin was generally used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements of ancient gold, silver, and copper are well-known because they occur naturally in pure form and are relatively simple to extract.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is very similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also postulated that they change into new elements that we see.
Alloys are usually a combination of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
You can get a hybrid metal with a small amount of a non-metallic element like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion of them could fit on the end of this sentence.
So Pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, since the advent of newer writing systems, the pencil is rarely used.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to approach a sharpener.
When something new comes along, you might be surprised by what's on the keyboard.
The fundamental principle on which a fission bomb works is that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pulling a heavy car up a hill, the nucleus releases some of that energy when it splits upward.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can break apart at the slightest jolt.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust.
The near side is about 70 km thick and the far side is about 100 km thick.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
Nearby it can be more deadly because the vegetation is thinner. Because it was easier to climb to the surface for profit.
Content methods are used to find out what people want to do or what motivates them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or expectations that become internalized as they mature.
These systems observe that certain people want to have the things they do and what objects in their environment cause them to do or not do the particular thing.
Two popular subject theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can arise when managers manage older employees. The first half of the range tends to be ""the best man"" (or woman)"."
Such essayists have complexities in making unfamiliar decisions, carrying out disciplinary procedures, assessing competence, giving responsibility, holding people accountable, etc.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is a morph of an unidentified person who feels that the group must change everything it has been doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behaviour usually creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are organized to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the working group sometimes act as liaisons due to their rapid physical clustering.
They are sometimes more independent than regular team members as their teams meet at different times which is not understood by their local management.
The actual "invisible team" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p109) is the unique component of the virtual team.
The ""invisible team"" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member. """
Why would an organization want to simplify a time-consuming process like setting up a training institute? One purpose of practicing organizational knowledge concepts is innovation.
Now all the resources available in an organization are used in different functional departments, creativity and talent can flow.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier and meet the needs of the customer gives rise to an innovative process.
Before an organization can become an innovator, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as a culture of knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) describes the continuum method as a method that is used to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide a body of evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition.
Brain pathology and behavior help scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain lesions, tumors, injuries, and behaviors affected by tumors alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and resources to create a simulation model to understand how our brain works.
Although AI has a strong scientific connotation, when AI deals with the use, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine, it forms a very important branch of computer science.
Research in AI has involved the construction of machines that can function autonomously where intelligent behavior is required.
"Examples include the ability to control, plan, and anticipate, assess clients, and answer questions, as well as recognize writing, sounds, and faces".""
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is incorporated into many home computer and video games.
Field trips are a part of any classroom. In many cases, teachers take their students on field trips to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology solves the problem of real field trips.Students can visit museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or they can sit in the classroom and admire beautiful art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina build a website about their visit to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept as a notebook.
Blogs can also help students with writing. Students start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, usually changed by the presence of an audience.
Students are sometimes a complicated audience, and bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
And blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to be intellectual and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"Proper use of blogs ""helps students become more analytical and sophisticated; by actively responding to Internet content, students can position themselves in relation to the writing of others as well as express their own opinions on particular issues (Areveke, 2002) """.
Ottawa is the attractive, bilingual capital of Canada and has a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
"To the far south is Negroia Falls, and to the north is Muscatine and its flowing home of natural beauty".""
All of this and more makes Ontario unmistakably Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some areas are almost uninhabited forest.
For a startling demographic comparison: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are an archipelago in the Indian Ocean extending along the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and one of the richest provinces in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or have ties to France and are known as luxury coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it took a major route to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
It is surrounded by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female visitor should say that she is married, whether she is actually married or not.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just don't make it look too expensive).
Women should realize that they are being exploited as a result of cultural diversity and it is not surprising that it is being observed, handled and so on.
Be tough on putting people down, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (culturally diverse or not, that's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badya and it was renamed Chasablanca by the Spaniards who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the most unattractive places to shop in Morocco.
Near the old medina it is easy to find places selling a full spectrum of traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, samaras, hookah and gigues, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
Lava flows from the Niragongo volcanic eruption devastated Goma in 2002, destroying most of the city's streets, especially in the city centre.
Guma is unquestionably safe, and anyone visiting from outside Guma should research the war in the North Kivu province of the country.
The city is also used as a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and offers some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
To get around Goma you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price for a short trip is ~500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu"" is also used as a symbol or metaphor for extremely remote places, since it is difficult to reach. """
Today Timbuktu is a poor town, although its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
Due to the threat posed by the desert sand, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
This is one of the main breaks in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonder of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because of its Arab rather than African influence.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The area covers about 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each with different wildlife.
"It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (Sun Park) """.
All national parks in South Africa have a standard for conservation and access.
Purchasing a Wild Card is advantageous for 1 person, giving access to selected South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong State and is the focus of many tourist attractions.
Hong Kong's skyscrapers are paraded by a magnificent bar chart that is visible from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across the Kowloon Strait.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is the place that was claimed by the British colonists and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial period in the region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal peatland, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within the borders of India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain the remains of vast jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which one-third is covered by water.
The Sundarbans has been a sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now over 400 tigers in the area and around 30,000 white-tailed deer.
Buses have been departing from the inter-district bus stand throughout the day (crossing the river), especially for those going to the east and Jakhar/Bamthang at 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are usually full, so it is advised to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Public buses are fast and comfortable for visiting nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
"The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River between Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges del'Oyapock, French Guiana".""
The height of the two minarets is 83 m, its length is 378 m and it has two lanes of 3.50 m width.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres at the base. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, by which time the checkpoints on the Brazilian side are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group, semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in what is now eastern Paraguay, who also practiced agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The 16th century Paraguay, called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the struggle of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous population.
The Spanish colonial period lasted almost three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Los Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games are also held at other times of the year.
Check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo for information on the tournament and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money could be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which was located in Stanley across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted throughout the island and Stanley credit cards are commonly accepted, and US dollars are often accepted as well.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted; contact the owner in advance about acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to change money outside the Falkland Islands, so change money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it experiences summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and winter elsewhere.
Montevideo" falls in the tropics. Temperatures in excess of 30 °C (86 °F) are common during the summer months.
Winters can be very cold: temperatures sometimes drop below freezing but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
"Neither ""rainy"" nor ""dry"" weather is specified: the amount of precipitation is roughly constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are visible to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be tamed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and tigers and 25 yards away from all other wild animals.
No matter what they look like, they can attack bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal.
Many visitors are injured each year because they do not keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they need to be given their space.
In addition, the smell may attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying smelly food and use clean campsites.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the administrative capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was infamous for a famous confrontation in 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain all avoided the harbor.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence under the Maoist movement, Paramount Chief Tupua Tamasese III was killed in a peaceful demonstration in the city.
Auckland has many beaches due to the straddling of the two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The Northern Shore Beaches (North Harbour District) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with sheltered coves and most have shade provided by deciduous trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is on Waitemata Harbour, an upmarket residential area of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are medium-sized family beaches with a variety of shops along the shore.
"The main local beer is ""Number One"", which is not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called ""Mantas""".

By booking a ticket in advance, passengers are free from the worry that they will have a place to sleep after reaching their destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific accommodation, although you may be able to find other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Packages offered by travel agents usually include breakfast, airport pick-up and drop-off, and sometimes airfare and hotel packages.
They can also make reservations for you if you need time to think about your exemption and to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Please contact the travel agent first for any corrections or requests and not directly with the hotel.
"At some festivals, large crowds at music festivals decide to camp at the site, and more crowds consider it a special experience".""
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get up early in the morning to camp near the music.
Keep in mind that the music may stop on the main stage, although there may be some parts of the festival that may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camps for families and young girls.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea on a cold day, check the location of the cabin, as breaking ice makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg ferries connect the city's time zone. Ferry passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see news).
Casinos typically make numerous attempts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent and exits are difficult to find.
To keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them grounded, offer them special food, drinks and entertainment.
In some parts of the house there are drinking facilities. However, since alcohol impairs judgment, all good jewelers know the importance of not drinking.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or on slopes should consider the possibility of ice, snow and bone-chilling temperatures.
There is very little friction on icy roads and you can't drive because it feels like there is nothing under your wheels.
During a heavy snowstorm, the snow can make you dizzy in no time.
Snow, sleet, or ice on the windshield can block the view.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries and motor vehicles run continuously throughout the year.
Safari expeditions were one of the biggest attractions of Chag African tourism and attracted many.
In popular usage, a team safari refers to a journey overland, especially in the savannah, for the most impressive view of African wildlife.
But animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to the car and high-quality materials will help to make it look better.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes very shy and need binoculars to see them well.
A trek (also known as a 'journey', 'walk' or 'trip') can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held at different venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you had booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, your situation may be more complicated.
Cancellation policies vary but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies in late March will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It was expected that tickets for most events would cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around ¥7000.
Wet clothes can be ironed and dried. Many hotels have a clothes drying iron, and a blade can be borrowed, although 1 may not be available in the hotel room.
If ironing is not available or if you are not very fond of wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to let clothing get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or fade in extreme conditions).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective than others.
In some regions, heating water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it may take longer.
The effectiveness of disinfectants varies, and you should buy bottled water from a reputable company if you are concerned.
Travelers may encounter insects that they have never seen before in their area.
Parasitic worms can spoil food, cause inflammation, and in extreme cases cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases or wild animals can use force to injure or kill humans, unlike normal fires.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods at certain locations duty-free.
Travelers can sometimes save a lot of money by visiting countries with high taxes, especially on drugs and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Petersburg Highway, often requiring passage through isolated Blackwood sections.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep in mind: the steep terrain, the narrow roads, and the majority of wide roads.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important that they be strictly adhered to.
Curiously, though, it has much better mobile phone service than other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good, and much of Bavaria is rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into the pastry year round, and cherries and gooseberries retain their presence during the summer months.
Many German pastries contain nuts, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are sometimes specially combined with a good cup of coffee.
"If you want something small and rich, try a pastry called Berliner, Proffenkochen or Korffenen, depending on the region".""
Curry is a dish based on vegetables and spices, either meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the water, the liquid may be either ""dry"" or ""wet""".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, curd is commonly used as an ingredient; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
Selected from over 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of dishes available throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term originally referred to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by its minimally processed, mainly used almond spices, ginger, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The footrope helps to support the rider's legs, which hang down either side of the saddle.
They provide good stability to the rider but can cause safety problems as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be swept away by the horse. Some precautions should be taken to eliminate this risk.
First, most climbers wear heels and smooth, narrow-soled climbing boots.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that have a rack attached to the saddle to catch a rider if he falls behind.
"Cachamo Valley - the site of Chile's original mountaineering, with large walls of different types of granite and crags. It is also called the Yosemite of South America".""
Mountaineers from around the world are constantly blazing new trails through the seemingly endless barriers.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve snow-covered terrain covered with skis to your feet and a snowboard.
"Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, known as ""ski bums"" on special occasions, planning to ski the entire weekend at a particular location".""
The concept of skiing is very old. Cave paintings suggest it may date back to 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing has been a sport since the 17th century, and the first recreational skiing club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This is also known as backcountry skiing, ski routing or ski hiking.
It is not related to, though related to, alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on two slopes or requiring fairly stiff skis or boots.
Think of a ski slope as a hiking trail.
If you're in good shape, you'll be able to cover more distance than walking - but you'll rarely have the speed to ski across two countries without a backpack on good roads.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Travel between countries normally requires multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area is like a country in this respect.
You can cross the border without going through passport control checkpoints for as long as you stay in the area, usually up to six days.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique in manufacturing. Some tax authorities define an antique as a product that is more than 100 years old.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where life expectancy may be lower by location, such as life expectancy in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can also be considered antiques, even if they are new compared to mass-produced identical products.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life among the Sami and is essential for many other livelihoods in the surrounding cultures.
Even traditionally, although not all Sami engaged in large-scale rearing of reindeer and made a living by fishing, hunting and similar means, reindeer were mainly kept as pack animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sami areas.
Although the term 'gypsy' is widely used, especially among non-Romanies, it is considered offensive because of its association with some negative misconceptions and misbeliefs about Romani people.
If the country you are travelling to is covered by the Ministry of Tourism, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can seek advice from governments outside your own, but their advice must be tailored to their citizens.
For example, Americans face a different set of circumstances in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Ministers are only a summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often faster, more general, and larger than the extensive data available elsewhere.
Severe weather is shorthand for any hazardous weather event that has the potential to cause loss, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on Earth, and there are many types of severe weather, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, snowfall and wildfires are the most adverse weather effects, as well as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and storms.
Regional and weather phenomena include ice storms and dust storms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of any adverse weather conditions likely to affect their area as these may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone needs to receive professional training.
