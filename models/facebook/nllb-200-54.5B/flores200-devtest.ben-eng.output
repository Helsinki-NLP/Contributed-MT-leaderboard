Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has gained wide acceptance, but the fossils do not provide detailed information, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say the upper part of the animal's plumage was brown and the underparts were pale or carotene-like.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have well-developed barbs, called barbules, but they did have another feature of feathers -- barbs and spines -- researchers speculate that barbules may have been a later evolutionary improvement.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers opined that, although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult feathers and did not show juvenile underparts.
According to the researchers, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not juveniles.

According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's director of park conservation and heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received much more safety and training instruction.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martley's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission is Martelly's response to the mass protests against those in power that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were exacerbated by the failure to hold elections, which have been stalled since 2011.
Nearly 60 incidents of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.

Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed she believed Australia would become a republic state at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed that they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the close of voting, 29 per cent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believed Australia would never become a republic.

The FAA claims NextGen is a means to help aircraft fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar-based technology to provide air traffic controllers with more accurate positioning of aircraft and to send more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is running to Wembley and overground trains do not stop, and there are no facilities for parking and driving on the road.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the game will be forced behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A paper on the evolution of a new species of bird from the Ecuadorian GalÃ¡pagos Islands was published Thursday in the journal Science Reports.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although the process is thought to have taken longer due to breeding between the Darwin finch, Jesopizza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Jesopizza coniferostris.
And thou shalt make enclosures of gold; enclosures of gold shalt thou make them.
It can be drawn on thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
"""It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals. It is so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are types of protons that have had their electrons stripped away (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Twist two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, press into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel weird and cause a kind of peeling.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Places such as ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes a part of people's bathing houses used by men and women together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space received the call and reflected it immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of our light and views.
It takes a giant rocket 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unprecedented way. What the wheel has done most for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other modes of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to caribou and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (stray pet cats) that prey on many small prey such as insects, rats, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a sense of place, a special task that keeps each cat from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males plus thirty females and cubs.
Being a large family of sisters and daughters, the women are usually closely related to each other.
The pride behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, behaving surprisingly similarly to lions (but not other big cats), and is extremely lethal to prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times as hard as a strong human.
Like lions, leopards, and jaguars, tigers are members of the genus Panthera.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but like a sentence made up of growling and screaming sounds.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if they can.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and eat by smell, where they find animals by scent as they walk on the ground.
With its sharp night vision and stealthy movements, the ocelot blends in with its surroundings and preys by pouncing on prey.
When a small organism (a small population) becomes separated from their main population (e.g. they move across a mountain range or river, or they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
There are different resources and different competitors in this new environment, so they need different features or adaptations than before to become more powerful competitors.
The actual populations haven't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations began to adapt to their new environments, they became less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which usually refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which is exhaled).
Plants use sunlight to make food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were sculpted with more than seventy razor sharp teeth, with an extra set at the top of the mouth, meaning it would have eaten anything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex was no match for it.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans also ate strange or unusual foods as part of their diet, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich people preferred to eat together in a row.
In the following centuries, ancient Roman cuisine could not contain any food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes or cocoa fruit and no ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built special temples for each of their gods, which were considered the homes of their respective deities.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to focus on meeting the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped columns called ziggurats were built as part of the temple.
The top of the pillar was the special abode of the Lord.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in courtyards; stores looked like counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses.
There were no major forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled haphazardly. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even before his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland differed greatly in people, kings, customs and history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that treasure maps were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Still, there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"""The original Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776"" whose words were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears below the flip side of the document".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document on the back (measuring 29 three by four inches by 24 and a half inches) was folded for preservation.
So, the mark was probably added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting resulted in the liberation of northern France, but not southern France.
"It was ruled by the ""Vichy"" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as ""Operation Dragoon""".
American and Free French forces were advancing into Germany, liberating southern France in just two weeks.
A civilization is a single culture that contains a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also somehow describes the shape of society.
City-states are the predecessors of states. A civilized culture refers to something that carries knowledge across many generations, the imprint of a lasting culture, and fair propagation.
Often, the culture of a small tribe or people loses its relevance in history due to lack of proper documentation and is not recognized as a so-called civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, under the Articles of Confederation, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress being the only part of it.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judicial committee at the time. Congress relied on state governments to impose and enforce taxes. State governments, on the other hand, were often uncooperative.
States do not have the power to levy taxes and duties.
The consent of all the states was required before amending the articles and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern countries due to the participation of Italians in the Olympics and various international competitions.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because of the Japanese archipelago, Japan is often referred to as ""the archipelago"" due to its geographical location".
Travel to Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern area of Taiwan to transform the production methods of the indigenous people and to employ Chinese workers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thereby ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures named Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what it was like.
By 1976, about thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still underway.
For example, the most common size for still image-photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the most dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It is still manufactured, but more important are the proportions it inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
Actually, the 35mm format is a bit confusing, 24mm by 36mm.
Therefore, the approximate ratio of this format (dividing by 12 gives the simple integer-number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to the aspect ratio.
The highly offensive and almost comical Rule of Thirds is a simple guideline that controls the order of movement in an image.
It states that the most useful space for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the figure into three parts along the vertical and horizontal (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Churches, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, despite differences in language and customs, Christianity held European nations together.
Its all-pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are there for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and many questions were raised as to whether it was being trusted with such an abundance of power and money.
Soon after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies has been successful, although the blockade violates generally accepted international norms imposed by various international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain dug international waterways to prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the sea, which also posed a danger to neutral ships.
Since the tactic met with limited response, Germany expected such a response in the case of its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the populations of most countries were predominantly pacifist and separatist-minded.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the first world war, nations wanted to avoid a repeat.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to Thomas Edison in America with just 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods; each period of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of unrest in the provinces divided between each dynasty. The best known of this period was the three-phase reign that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period there were fierce battles between many nobles in the struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the bloody period fighting for the highest seat in the palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the change from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism and the republic not being the sole ruler of the country.
At the same time, after the revolution, professional opportunities were opened to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same applies to the army because instead of army rankings being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside this worldly life. For meditation he sometimes used a cave known as the ""Hira"" of the ""Noor"" (Light) Mountain". "
He himself built the cave, which has survived many times, providing a vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Resting atop a hill north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it exists, it's not exactly easy to find.
There is nothing to see except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, a world rarely seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the only Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of the pharaoh.
"The Giza Necropolis, or ""Giza Necropolis"", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the massive Sphinx. "
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu. Many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The ""up bow"" symbol resembles a V, and the ""down bow"" symbol resembles a staple or square without the bottom".
Up means you should start from the edge and push the bow and down means you should start from the frog (where you are holding the bow in your hand) and pull the bow.
A bow usually produces soft sounds, while a down-bow is stronger and more insistent.
Feel free to use pencils on your own marks but remember that Boeing's printed marks are for musical instruments, so they should generally be respected.
King Louis XVI of France, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a group of saleswomen.
They were on their way back to Paris in a car amid an angry crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The excited crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their car windows open.
At one point, one of the excited crowds shook the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of US imperialism as the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government in order to create confusion about a large portion of the expenditures and interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the excess profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people will form the basis of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must first understand the context in which they were formed.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages (1000-1300 AD), the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history.
The Early Middle Ages were preceded and followed by the High Middle Ages, ending with the Conquest around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that can mean anything from a broad, technological push or technological move to a strict idea that holds that human destiny is governed by an underlying scientific law and its technological application.
"Most technological determinism has two common explanations: that technological development itself follows a path, rather than being primarily cultural or political, and that technology has ""effects"" on underlying societies rather than social conditions as a result".
For example, one may say that motor cars are essential to road development.
A nationwide road network is not economically feasible, at least for a handful of cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
With more people owning cars, there is an increased risk of road accidents, which has led to the development of new strategies in the medical system to care for the injured.
A major factor in determining the direction of culture was the Romanticism of writers like Schlegel, Gotha, Fichte.
In the context of Romanticism, the geographically confined individual evolves over time the customs and culture associated with that area, adapting to that place in society better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century when the Crusaders brought gifts of silk and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine market price.
It was from this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, customs in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop their own identities. One of the greatest developments of the period was the use of buttons by the people to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture that produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
The farming that farmers do to meet their own needs is simple and often organic, with people in areas with similar temperature, humidity and solar radiation and similar geographical features rotating crops with surviving seeds or some other common method for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for their livelihood, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out on the scale of social judgment and help them build their identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The attributes that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of various concerns.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of styles, including fashion, type, and dialect.
Some common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization are to create unfortunate circumstances such as neglect, unwanted behavior, and deliberate abuse of children as they grow up, which prevent them from mingling with adults.
"""Such children are called ""feral"" or feral. Some ""feral"" children are usually kept in captivity (by their own parents); in some cases these children are abandoned due to parental rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability """
Inexperienced children may have suffered a lot of abuse or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are known to live in the forest by choice.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child often exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) similar to those of the fully cared-for animal, such as its fear or dislike of humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but an aid that provides support to people who are having a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be either fake or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffold but a little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software to help with questions that are difficult for a single learner to explain immediately and quickly.
From neglect, abuse and even extortion, children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but they do.
We realize that the foster care system is a safe place for children.
Our foster care system allows for safe homes, loving providers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The Guardianship of the East was supposed to provide all the essentials that were lacking.
The Internet is a combined medium of both mass and interpersonal information.
The unique features of the Internet have added an extra dimension in terms of usability and enjoyment.
"For example, ""education"" and ""socialization"" are suggested as motivations for using the Internet (James et al.,1995)".
"Aimee and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal involvement"" and ""continuing relationships"" as aspects of new motivation when examining audience responses to websites".
The use of video recording led to important innovations in the interpretation of facial movements, short expressions lasting for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed to be able to tell if a person is lying by accurately detecting their subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his letter to the President, pointed out that having a brain defect meant being unable to understand speech but being able to correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that domestic animals such as dogs have the same ability to analyze human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that genetic variation has two aspects: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection removes it from the expressed variation.
Separation and recombination help bring diversity between the two pools of each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino-acid requirements from readily available plant resources.
On top of that, failure to do so is leading to serious problems like depression, malnutrition and premature death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the proteins in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
In comparison, animal foods (ants, quails, eggs) that are not only easily digested, but also provide a high amount of protein in which all essential amino acids are found.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in the same way that chimpanzees now do in the savannah".
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally staying awake during normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
Using a relatively quiet alarm clock can easily keep you awake without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock manually during sleep, you might be able to move it to the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed when it's turned off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to get up to urinate.
A person's peace of mind is directly and inversely related to the state of his body and soul.
The fewer the thoughts, the more positive the presence of life force. The potential to find ultimate peace and contentment lies within each individual.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the techniques of Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the expression of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (consciousness energy) is awakened through yoga practice, breathing exercises, chanting and visualization.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the realization of deity energy, the channels of energy release are purified, the chakras are activated and consciousness is created.
Germany, the main enemy of World War II, was central to the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. As the war ended, infighting between the countries led to infighting over systems, processes, and culture.
Within two years of the war's outbreak, old allies had become adversaries and the Cold War had begun.
Subsequently it lasted for 40 years and then real fighting began with mercenary armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and more.
By September 17, 1939 the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were cancelled overnight when the Soviet Union's 800,000-strong Red Army invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, opening the war in Belarus and Ukraine. The Riga Treaty was a Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact.
Ships are the easiest way to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods by sea.
Traditionally, the role of the Navy has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods and at the same time that your enemy faces interference in its ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allied powers had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and leather.
Domesticated goats, usually in the mountains or other grazing areas, roamed within specific herds. Children or adolescents, known as herders, were usually in charge of caring for them.
By the 16th century, wagon trains had made their way to England.
Although the carriage roads were just a series of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to move faster and carry more weight than the more uneven roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron spike on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron stuck to the wooden wheels of the freight car.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron railway was put into operation in 1767.
Walking was the first form of transportation, and humans have been walking since Homo erectus could stand upright about two million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not naturally walk upright.
Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago show features of bipedalism, while Sahelanthropus is thought to have started walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can be more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become environmental activists, so that future suffering can be reduced to some extent.
It's a bit like symptom-based therapy, but if we don't just want a temporary fix, we need to get to the root of the problem and we need to fix it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by the legislature on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by John Hancock, president of the legislature, and Charles Thomson, secretary, was sent to John Dunlop's printing office a few blocks away.
"150 to 200 copies were made that night, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides""".
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
1 was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest copies of the document known to still exist. The original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
Many paleontologists today still believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, they walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of the two values 0 or 1, and for use as a computer language these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common which cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of free radicals in medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists formally use the term bug to identify this group of insects.
The term is derived from an old familiar term for bed-bugs, which are insects highly adapted to being pollinated by human pollinators.
Both killer-insects and cockroaches have been observed, adapting to live in their host's nest or habitat.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not for them or for their children to raise the child as their own.
These couples can make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can parent the child.
The main goal of science is to determine the way the world works in the scientific method. This determines the direction of scientific research.
Not only that, but an experiment is a method used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask and observe questions, as well as to direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
By denying knowledge of Greece, the West began to distance itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed at the level of physiology and behavior are present in endogenous cycles and often their production depends on the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have their own long-term oscillators that will continue for periods of time, even without external forces, such as free cycling.
One of the pioneering proofs that DNA is a genetic material was the experiment of Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two studies by identifying the DNA of the phase with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phase with a radioactive sulfur.
A mutation in a gene can cause a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the severity of damage to the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations that occur in germ-line cells can be carried into the baby, elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape including flora, fauna and wildlife.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and exploring parks and learning about ecosystems.
In Borneo, for example, there are opportunities to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans.
Every morning workers leave small towns to drive to their workplaces, passing by people who live in other people's workplaces.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation system, everyone is somehow connected and supportive of a transportation system based on personal cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has shaken the biosphere out of its stable state that was suitable for human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transportation systems raise such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the movement and interaction between two drivers and their vehicles between two points.
Unfortunately, vehicle movements are difficult to predict because drivers' deceleration can never be understood with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to move within a certain continuous range, and thus transport systems can also be represented mathematically within a fairly reasonable range.
To better represent the traffic flow, three key characteristics are related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and managing road facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helps them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most moths have the ability to fold the back of their body with their wings.
This gives them wide ranges in small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are grasshoppers and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Although some people agreed with him, most people disagreed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
It seems prudent, because you don't understand that the Earth is spinning, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, some six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the planet's river water entering the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none could surpass the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical excellence of their construction.
The new generation marveled at the monuments of the ancient Egyptians, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legal affairs and official communications.
To those who worked in the state, Italian was the everyday practical language, and Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with various basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper, because they are found in nature in the form of ores and the basic elements of ancient tools are equivalent to these minerals.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although his theory states that they coalesce into new matter to form what we see.
Hybrid metals are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Objects such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have hybrid metals that have small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in this world is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
This is how the pen became man's best friend.
Sadly, as new methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, never needing a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
Fusion bombs work on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, the nuclei are splitting and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no damage.
The surface of the Moon is composed of dust and rock. The outer surface of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick at the front and 100 km thick at the back.
It is thin in maria and thick in highlands.
Since the crust is thin, there may be more maria near the crust.
The goal of content theories is to find out what people tick off or what is appealing to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that develop within them as they age.
These theories focus on what motivates certain people to do what they do and what things in their environment will motivate them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One part of the behaviors is trying to be ""one of the boys"" (or girl)".
Such managers face obstacles in making unpopular decisions, disciplinary measures, performance appraisals, allocation of responsibilities, and ensuring people are accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, incredibly one becomes someone who feels they must change everything that is being done in the group and make it their own.
After all, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams were able to maintain their quality compared to traditional teams, but there were also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact in their immediate physical branches.
They often have more individual freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a true ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFastow, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the nonpartisan team".
The ""invisible team"" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member. "
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning replacement? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the functional logistics available are used in different departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flow.
As a result, when all the employees of an organization work together to overcome the barriers, new innovative processes are created that will meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, the person in charge of the organisation needs to create an innovation culture as well as upward knowledge sharing and institutional learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as being used as a method to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neuroscientific data provide practical evidence for theoretical approaches to knowledge discovery. It therefore summarizes the field of research and makes it more precise.
The interrelationship between brain structure and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore unseen structures and processes in our brains.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of the mind.
Although AI has strong intentions in science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of a machine's behavior, learning, and intelligence.
AI research involves building machines that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer needs and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are built into most home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will choose to take students to places where bus travel is not available.
In every non-physical field, technology offers its solutions.Students can visit museum exhibits, aquariums or admire beautiful art right from their classrooms.
Sharing the details of a virtual trip is a great way to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol. Every year the website is redesigned, but the old version is left in the scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing.Although students often make grammar and spelling mistakes when they start blogging, they are usually corrected by the presence of the reader.
Since students are the most critical audience, the author of the blog focused on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging ""forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them. "" Influences students to be more resourceful and inquisitive to satisfy audience interest (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a good way to learn, inspire and collaborate outside the traditional school curriculum.
Appropriate use of blogs 'can make students more analytical and critical; students can explain their positions through active responses to Internet materials in the context of others' writing and at the same time outline their own views on specific issues' (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's picturesque, bilingual capital that showcases Canada's past and present through various art exhibitions and museums.
Further south, Niagara Falls and beyond to Muskoka in the north are centres of unspoilt natural beauty.
These things and more make Ontario uniquely Canadian to outsiders.
Vast areas further north are sparsely populated and nearby are somewhat almost uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.

Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was skillfully used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a port called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar el-Bada and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is the least attractive place to shop in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookah and more are easily available around the old medina, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist-heavy city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, just east of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which destroyed most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any trip outside of Goma should be researched to understand the war situation in North Kivu province.
The town was a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as tracking Africa's low-cost mountain gorillas.
To get to Goma you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The typical (local) price for a short trip is ~500 Congolese Francs.
"""Timbuktu"" combined with its relative remoteness has been used as an ornament for outlying, remote areas. "
Today, Timbuktu is a poor country, although due to its popularity it is an attractive tourist destination and has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to risks related to desert sand.
This was one of the main stumbling blocks when Henry Louis Gates's PBS special African Wonders of the World was made.
This city is quite different from other cities in the country, because the atmosphere here is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.

Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
The site was claimed by the colonists and so is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) along the coasts of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include the last remnants of the endangered forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is wetland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the region now has an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Chitra deer.
From the Interdistrict Bus Station (across the river) buses depart throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakhar/Boumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advised to buy tickets a few days in advance as inter-district buses are often full.

The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The GuaranÃ­ were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also did subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the GuaycurÃº and PayaguÃ¡, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"Paraguay, born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with local indigenous groups in the 16th century, was known as the ""Giant Province of the Indies""".
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of AsunciÃ³n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.

Officially the currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equal to 1 British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank in Stanley, located across from the FIC West store.
Credit cards and United States dollars are also widely accepted, usually in British pounds and stanleys, anywhere on the islands.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and U.S. currency is accepted; check with owners in advance for exact payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is dry when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures commonly exceed +30Â°C.
Winters can be strangely cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the air and humidity combined feel colder than a thermometer.
There is no particular "rainy" or "dry" season: roughly the same amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Although all the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the animals in the forest are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
Bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal may attack, no matter how peaceful they seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year due to not maintaining proper distancing.These animals are usually large, wild and potentially dangerous, so let them be in their own space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying smelly food or cooked food, and keep the campsite clean.

Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Often travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport or even combined flight and hotel packages or transportation arrangements.
If they need time to collect other documents for your destination (e.g. visa) or to consider the offer, they may hold the reservation for you.
Any amendments or requests should be made to the travel agent before contacting the hotel directly.
At some festivals, large numbers of people attending concerts decide to camp at the site, and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get in on the action, you'll need to get to a music-focused campsite early.

In some places alcohol is available as a beverage. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of moderation.
If someone is going to drive over hills or mountains, he should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or cold temperatures.
On snow and icy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you are on an uncovered pitch.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall or blowing snow or frozen snow on the windshield.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in several countries, and traffic runs smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a major draw for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to mean a land journey to see fascinating African wildlife, especially savannah wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach vehicles, and having certain equipment will help them see better.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari typically (called a ""bush walk"", ""hiking safari"" or ""footing"") consists of either several hours or several days of hiking".
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation before the cancellation in 2020, you are in for a very embarrassing situation.
The cancellation policy is subject to change, but the coronavirus-based cancellation policies adopted in late March are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled to take place.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to be between Â¥2,500 and Â¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around Â¥7,000.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards, even when no one is at home.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to make the cloth too hot (this may cause shrinkage or even burns).
There are various methods of water purification, out of which certain methods are more effective.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in other areas, boiling water for several minutes is required.
Filters vary in effectiveness and if you are concerned, you should buy sealed water bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pesticides that they would not normally see in their area.
Insects spoil food, irritate or, worse, cause allergies, spread toxins and infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by applying force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods without paying taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers can sometimes save a lot of money by going to countries with high taxes, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont creates some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway for frequent travelers through isolated woodlands.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use common sense: steep slopes, narrow streets, and sharp turns are preferred.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these speed limits is critical.
Oddly, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than on several other sections of the route, for example: Pennsylvania Wild.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbor Austria, most are rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are traditional, apples are cooked in pastries all year round and cherries and plums make their appearance in summer.
Nuts, hazelnuts, and other nut ingredients are found in many baked goods in Germany.
If you want some small but good quality pastries, try something called berliner, faffenkuchen or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""juicy"" depending on the liquid content".
In North India and Pakistan, curd is commonly used in curries; whereas in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Across the country's 17,000 islands, the extensive list of Indonesian dishes includes a variety of local terms.
However, if used without further qualification, the term mainly refers to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Cheap Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago, which is a combination of only a few seasonal dishes. The main attractions of Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The rider's footplate is the support for the rider's foot that exists on either side of the rider's harness.
They provide riders with more balance but safety concerns remain due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in them.
If a horse throws its rider while one leg is caught in the strap, the horse will drag them away even if they escape. To reduce this risk, several protective precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have heels and a smooth, almost narrow, sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a strap to fall off a leather jean when pulled back by a falling rider.
Cocamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, including the great wall of granite known as South America's Yosemite and the Duraro Mountains.
The peaks offer breathtaking views and climbers from all over the world continue to blaze new trails on its walls of endless possibility.
Snow sports popular in mountainous areas include skiing and snowboarding, which involves sliding on snow with skis or a snowboard attached to the foot.
"Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, who plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location, known as ""ski bums""".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiing have been found dating back to around 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
While there are similarities between the methods of alpine ski touring and mountaineering, they are not mutually exclusive, the latter having to be done over steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
Under the right conditions, you can cover slightly more distance than walking - but you won't get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Although Europe is a relatively small continent, it contains a number of distinct countries. Under normal circumstances, travel between countries requires multiple visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions a bit like a country in this respect.
As long as you are in the area, you can usually cross the country's borders without going through these passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies classify items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by geographic location, with the age limit being lower in North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be called ancient, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Deer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the practices associated with this business are important to many associated with other professions.
Even traditionally, although reindeer were mainly used as pack animals, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they made a living by fishing, hunting and similar work.
Today, many Sami work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of SÃ¡pmi.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romanies, the term ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people".
If the country you are visiting is covered by a travel warning, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can ask the reasoning of governments other than your own, but their reasoning is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisers are only a summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often quick, general and oversimplified compared to detailed information readily available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any hazardous weather event such as damage, severe social disaster or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and can be of any type depending on geographical location, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as lightning, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include heavy snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
