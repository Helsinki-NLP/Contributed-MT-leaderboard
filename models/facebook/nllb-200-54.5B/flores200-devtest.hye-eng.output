Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's feathers were brown on the upper surface and pale or yellowish on the underside.
The invention also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed fin called a caudal fin, but have the other characteristics of feathers, such as barbed whiskers and whiskers, researchers hypothesized that the caudal fin probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather and not a juvenile.
The researchers speculate that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plume and not a juvenile.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

In France, voting is traditionally done with simple technology: Voters isolate themselves in a voting booth, put a pre-printed ballot in an envelope, where they mark the candidate of their choice.
Once the official has verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The French electoral law codifies the ballots quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes have been added except those that have been properly counted and allowed to the voters.
Candidates can send representatives to be personally present at each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strictly controlled conditions following special procedures.

Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of his son.
He was in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be undermined because his image had been widely published.
Generally, this is common practice throughout the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists are putting themselves at risk by publishing photos and other material of suspects".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment was filed.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute: Palestine wants borders based on those before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
In an additional pest control trial, the firefighters were under the direct supervision of forest rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Wildlife Conservation and Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation had undergone comprehensive safety and training.
Yesterday, the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council swore in Martelli.
It's Martelli's fifth express delivery in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures leading the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to widespread protests against the ruling power that began in October.
At times, violent protests have been motivated by the failure to hold elections, some as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The State Department responded by calling the delay of the Apple report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday evening).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reported no damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to go to the bathroom.
The Ligginses followed in their father's footsteps and became doctors.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm births in her spare time.
His research suggests that fetal lung maturation can be accelerated by administering a single hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered the two black boxes of the flight recorder.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. She was my first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe even more...that she loved him and will miss him...hoping he is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view: they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In a recent poll, 29% of respondents believed that Australia would become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia would never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness was called into question.
She wasn't able to take the pills she needed to manage her pain because they were banned by the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political rhetoric and stupidity".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to target aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional vehicles will be introduced and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and on-ground car parking, vehicle parking and ride-hailing facilities are unavailable.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increased the likelihood that they would have to play the game behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer due to crossbreeding between Darwin's endemic medium-sized terrestrial serinus and the hardy cactus serinus, Serinus coniferus.
Gold can be made into any shape. It can be spun into tiny moulds.
It can be pulled by a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be rolled or folded into a sheet.
It could be made very thin and inserted into another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline it is.
In a test chemical, the pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the amount of H in the pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons stripped from them (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry face powders together, and then with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands is going to react with the outer layers, which is going to be funny, and it's going to create a kind of a shield.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, a satellite receives a call and responds to it almost instantly.
In space, scientists use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a huge 100-foot-long rocket.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done is provide us with easier and faster transportation.
It gave us the train, the automobile, and many other forms of transportation.
Most of them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and elk.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on many more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the ventricle, where each cat has a specific job that keeps it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most gregarious of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three consanguineous adult males, who may be accompanied by more than thirty females and offspring.
Females are usually more closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions act more like packs of wolves or dogs, the animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-developed athlete, the tiger can climb (not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, zebras, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a series of murmuring, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If given the opportunity, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey animals (bears) by scent, sniffing out all the places on the ground where they have been.
Ocelots hunt by blending into their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will invariably end up in another environment that is different from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits and adaptability than previously required to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they like the other population less and less.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that it will be impossible to call them the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that people breathe, and they breathe in the carbon dioxide that people exhale -- that's air.
Plants get their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything but other Mosasaurs.
It had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth in its long jaws, with an extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning that anything in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a man-eater.
It attacked anything that got into the water, even the giant dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus rex, was no match for it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did carry strange or unusual elements of animals, including wild oats, ivy, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another possibility was that while the poor people and the woman sat on chairs and ate their bread, the rich liked to hold banquets together where they would lean side by side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that had come from Europe, the Americas, Asia over the centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, they didn't have tomatoes, they didn't have potatoes, they didn't have cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central temple that was considered to be the house of a god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only priests may enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Much of a Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were open-air storefronts facing the street, and stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce, and timber was expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered it and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Nation's Treasures", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Despite what it says on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words, "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that a large vellum document was previously in storage (measuring 293⁄4 inches long by 241⁄2 inches wide).
It is therefore possible that the notation was added as a direct trademark.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was run by the Vichy French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France in an invasion codenamed "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and French independent forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a fairly large group of people living and cooperating together: a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "civilized", which is related to the Latin word "civis", which means "citizen", and "civitas", which means "city" or "city-state", and it also sort of defines the scope of society.
City-states are the prototypes of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a long cultural trace, and the equitable distribution of information.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and thus are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a weak central government, with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state governments, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
It also didn't have the power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, along with Germany, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a reform of local grain cultivation practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 proclaimed Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most popular photographic still image format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing -- 36mm wide, 24mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve so we can get the simplest whole number ratio) is, as they say, 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics by maintaining the order of the image.
It states that the most effective part of the main subject is the point of intersection of the lines, which vertically and horizontally divides the image into three parts (see example).
The Catholic Church, now wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite differences in language and culture.
Its pervasive power dominance affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central structure of the Church had been in Rome for nearly a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma had been preserved.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective in cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian goods, although the blockade violated universally accepted international law, as enshrined in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain dredged international waters to prevent shipping from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted U-boat warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of many citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former employer, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a peculiar way of representing different periods: each period of China or each ruling family was considered a separate dynasty.
It was also an unstable period of states divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for supremacy in the Great Wall of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true in the military, because instead of a rank-based military hierarchy, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. To meditate, he often visited a cave that came to be known as Hira, "the light" on the mountain.
The cave, which has survived the ages, is a very vivid illustration of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched atop a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows it's there.
There is very little of this world to be seen or heard from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Egyptians built the Great Pyramid in the third century B.C.E., one of many great pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, or "Giza Necropolis", contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family.
The "up arrow" looks like a V, and the "down arrow" looks like a square bracket or a square with no bottom edge.
Top means you have to start at the top and pull the bow, and bottom means you have to start at the arrow part (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow held high usually produces a softer sound, while a bow held low produces a louder and more insistent sound.
You can use a pencil to make your own notes, but remember that the printed reverb is there for musical purposes, so it's usually something to consider.
On 6 October 1789, a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to flee Versailles for Paris after being attacked by a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the Queen and the King.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage window wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal soldier killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The cost of the US imperialist war to occupy the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to pay for the interest and most of the costs on the bonds that were placed on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The year in which the events took place is usually referred to as the Early Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the very sense that human destiny is driven by basic logic in conjunction with scientific laws and other manifestations of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on individual societies rather than being socially determined.
For example, you could say that the motor car necessarily leads to better roads.
However, a dispersed road network across the country is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars on the roads also leads to a high number of accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the medical field to treat damaged organs.
Romanticism is a major element of cultural determinism, seen in writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture associated with that geography increased; the latter, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
As a center of conflict, it rose to prominence about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing with them gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was then that the fashion capital of the world shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress in the East was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow pace of communication in the West, styles can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of the period was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothing as a result of the Crusades.
The goal of subsistence farming is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agroecology is a simple, often organic system that uses ecoregion-specific stored seeds combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, many farmers have engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this still continues in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be diverse due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a particular subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style that includes fashion, frivolity, and misuse of terms.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to look at a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, unhappiness and deliberate abuse by adults, have not been socialized by adults as they age.
Such children are referred to as feral or feral. Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment was due to rejection by a severely mentally or physically disabled parent.
Children in the wild may have been brutally exploited or traumatized before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
When a feral child is raised with a non-domesticated animal, it exhibits behaviors (in physical terms) that are almost entirely similar to those of particularly wary animals, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While software courses are supposed to make learning easier and more fun, code generation goes a step further.
Code generation is not a learning method, but rather an aid, supporting individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The sticks can be both virtual and physical, so in other words, the teacher is a form of a stick, but so is the person with the small folder in the Microsoft office.
The virtual sticks are integrated into the software and are designed to ask, prompt and explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to tackle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they're not fed, cared for and educated, but they still are.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The adoptive family is supposed to take care of all the needs that they didn't get in the home that they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The characterization of the Internet leads to additional criteria in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as important motives for using the Internet. - James et al., 1995.
"Aimee and McCord also considered 'personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' to be aspects of new motivation (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
Video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, they claim that you can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new ancestral trait, while selection removes it from the gene pool.
Segregation and recombination mix the changes between the two populations in each generation.
Out on the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive system struggles to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
What's more, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins that are available in leaves and beans, but like us, they're difficult for primates to digest unless they're cooked.
Unlike animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) they are not only more easily digested, but they also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised to learn that our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and going back to sleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes later).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up without waking you up completely.
If you change your alarm clock again while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which causes a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive force you have in your life. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can get an education. The only thing that stops us from getting that is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but spread through the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and meditations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy pathways are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural clashes forced the countries to abandon the agreement reached.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years, and replacement armies, real armies, would fight battles from Africa to Asia to Afghanistan to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were shattered almost overnight when approximately 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Navy was to make sure that your country maintained the ability to move its people and its goods, while at the same time impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One recent notable example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to help Britain by transporting men and supplies across the Atlantic.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, was trying to block this route.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to invade Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began preserving them to make milk, hair, meat and linen readily available.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that grazed on hills or pastures, often followed by kids who were typically children or teenagers, like the more widespread herders. These breeding methods are still used today.
Chariots were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the relatively less level roads of the day.
Railroad spikes were introduced fairly early to hold railroad tracks in place. However, it gradually became clear that the tracks would be more effective if covered with iron.
This became a common practice, but the iron on the wooden wheels of the wagons caused more wear.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron tracks were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and human beings started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, didn't usually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become advocates for reducing some of the suffering in the future.
This is just like treating the symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and eradicate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and people's unrestrained lifestyle.
When Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten copy, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, the document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
To date, the 25 Dunlap liners known to still exist are the oldest surviving examples of the document. The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot of talk about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like Tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all computers we use today are based on information processing that's encoded in binary.
A binary number system can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough not to be immediately diagnosed.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term intermediate is used by entomologists to formally refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an early acquaintance with stick insects, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Killer insects and woodlice are sedentary, adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
There are about 400,000 diagnosed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) per year in the United States, proving that it is still the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely as men to have a master's degree in science.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise the child as a single parent.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
At the time of adoption, the parents who gave birth to the child terminate their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The whole point of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and the scientific method actually guides basic scientific inquiry.
But it's not just an experiment. An experiment is a test that uses questions to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, and observations also guide research.
Philosophers and naturalists turned their attention to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noted that the repetition of physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the availability of endogenous cycles and the creation of these cycles by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue spinning freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used phages and viruses to transplant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling DNA in a phage with radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur from a phage protein.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the function of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in embryonic cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural places to enjoy the scenery as well as the flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns on the outskirts to their jobs, meeting others on the way whose jobs are in the same towns they just left.
Everyone on this high-speed commuter train is somehow connected to and supportive of the private car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human development for the past two million years.
Everybody is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everybody complains about the state of transportation systems.
You rarely hear this level of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges in the developed world.
Why are transportation systems the subject of so many protests, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers incompetent, or are more fundamental things going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is not 100 percent predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to keep a fairly constant distance, so traffic flow tends to have some reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, a relationship was established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help guide the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wide variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the world's rivers -- the water that flows into the ocean -- flows out of the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although spherical structures made of stone survived until the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
In the ancient world, people were aware of the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper because they occurred naturally in nature and were relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also suggested that they transform into new materials, forming what we see.
Castings are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have compounds that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil came along, it was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil became less useful and less prestigious.
People are now typing messages on computer screens without ever having to reach for a pen.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will look like when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like spinning a wheelbarrow up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no guidance.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The outer crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner in water and thicker in the mountains.
There could be more eruptions on this side because the outer crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come out on the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick or seem attractive to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
These theories aim to find out what makes some people want the things they do and what environmental factors will make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers: One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the first guys (or girls)".
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a creature transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team does and make his own moves.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This is often a source of friction between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as physical teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which can be confusing to their local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can be demonstrated when all the resources available in the functional operational departments of an organization are used effectively.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customer.
Before any organization can become innovative, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, therefore narrowing the field of study and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain injury -- trauma, infection and tumors -- affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build models that help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation to machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, programming and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things are becoming separate disciplines that are focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been built into several computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any course. Often the teacher will want to take their students to places where the bus can't go.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips, where students can look at cultural artifacts in museums, visit aquariums or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing about the field trip is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capitol, and every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online as a registry.
Blogs can also be useful in improving students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers mainly changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger struggles to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "makes students more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy an audience's curiosity inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by responding more effectively to online material, students can contextualize what others have written and position themselves on issues to shape their own perspectives". - Oravec, 2002.
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is adorned with art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more underscores Ontario's reputation as a model Canadian city to outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited deserts.
As a population comparison, which surprises a lot of people, there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of wildlife, it's a unique continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or attached to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it has come a long way in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling say she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
Also, wearing a ring is useful -- just not one that's too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, handcuffed and so on.
Be assertive about saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself -- even if it's a cultural difference, right?
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-l-Badiya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is not difficult to find places in the medina that sell traditional Moroccan items such as spicy dishes, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of charms, but all this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, covering most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of military operations that continue in North Kivu province.
The town is also a starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, tracking down some of the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around Goma you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu was used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it attractive for tourists, it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Lewis on his PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
The Kruger National Reserve (KNR) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends east along the border with Mozambique, north into Zimbabwe, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different branches of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It can also be profitable to buy a Wild Card, which gives access to various South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major attraction for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering skyline made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, head off the island and head to the opposite side, Kowloon Waterfall.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban sprawl is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is where the British colonists considered themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is considered to be the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested area within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 caribou in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although the eastbound and Jakhar/Bumthang trains depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many areas are served by small Japanese beach buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Half-price taxis are a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River between the city of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The height of the two towers reaches 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two rows 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance at the bottom of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was even closed to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the work of the Brazilian customs points is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group to inhabit what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers engaged in subsistence agriculture of crops.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Pagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indians", was created by a clash between Spanish conquistadores and native Indian tribes.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
When Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay was able to retain much of its indigenous description and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the countries with the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
During the rest of the year, smaller tournaments and meetings are also held here.
For information on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the Falkland Islands Company's Western Store.
The British pound sterling is generally accepted throughout the islands, as are Stanley credit cards. United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, but British and U.S. currency may be accepted, check with the owners beforehand to understand what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold - temperatures rarely drop below freezing - but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons; roughly the same amount of rain falls throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the management of the reserve, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wild animals.
As docile as they may seem, bison, reindeer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so avoid having or preparing odorous food, and keep campgrounds clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of an inglorious naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. About 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, peaceful rallies in the city resulted in the assassination of paramount leader Tupua Tamasese Lelofi G.
There are a lot of beaches in Auckland because of the two harbours on either side.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are all safe sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shaded areas provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour in the upper-class suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with all kinds of shops lining the waterfront.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is a simple beer but has a pleasant and refreshing character. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better.
Local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but if you're scared, bottled water is easy to find.
Short black is espresso, cappuccino is served with heavy cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is even up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but taste great.
Many trips to underwater reefs are made throughout the year, and injuries to underwater rocks based on any of these causes are very rare.
As always, listen to the advice of authorities, obey all signs and pay attention to safety signals.
Box jellyfish have been found near beaches and estuaries between October and April since the 1770s. They can occasionally be found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of humans and swim far from shore.
Saltwater crocodiles don't just live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often deal with specific hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your chosen accommodation (e.g. an entry visa).
However, any changes and enquiries should first be investigated through a travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the overwhelming majority of visitors choose to camp at the site, and many visitors consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the concert, you have to get in early to pitch the tent close to the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may be some sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you decide to cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of your boat, as crossing the ice can be quite noisy for those most affected.
A cruise to St. Petersburg also includes entertainment in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to make guests spend more time and money. There are usually no clocks or windows, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and inside the building.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served in the home. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes needs to watch out for snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, contact is low, and you cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, you can get quite a lot of snow in a very short period of time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or blowing on the windows of the car or by thickening or ice on them.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest driver of tourism in Africa and a destination for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used to refer to travel overland to view Africa's spectacular wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment gives you a good view of them up close.
Lions, hyenas, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
A safari tour (also called a bushwalk, safari trek, or walk) involves treks of either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Several events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having done so in 1964.
If you have booked your tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, all cancellations due to the coronavirus have not been extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most of the events are expected to cost 2,500 to 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes will help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be rented even if no one is in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdresser if available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (which could cause a burn or a wrinkle).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their neighborhood.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by brute force do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping allows you to buy goods free of taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers who go to a country with a heavy tax system can sometimes save a great deal of money, especially on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most dangerous driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated deep forested terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your emotions to yourself: cliffs, narrow lanes and sharp turns dominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and following sections at 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is more important than anything else.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, quite rich and varied, and the same can be said of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are made all year round, and cherry and plum cakes bring their freshness during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular pastries often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but filling pastry, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices prepared with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curries; in southern India and a few other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly added.
With around 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But if used without further qualification, the term generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Hawaiian cuisine is characterized by a simple seasoned array of dishes, with the predominant flavor additions of the Hawaiians being peanuts, hot peppers, sugar (especially Hawaiian coconut sugar) and various spicy condiments.
The paddles that hang on either side of the pole protect the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may have safety concerns as there is a possibility that the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse, but the leg remains in the stirrup, the horse may drag him if he runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, all riders wear riding shoes with a flat heel and a fairly narrow toe box.
Then some poles, particularly English poles, have safety slides that allow the saddle pad to hang from the pole as the falling rider pulls it back.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America for its variety of large granite boulders and boulders.
The trains include spectacular views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world continuously create new routes through the potential of its endless walls.
Ski mountaineering, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing or snowboarding on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for very enthusiastic people, known as "ski junkies", who plan their entire vacation around skiing.
The idea of skating is very old; cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5,000 B.C.
Ski mountaineering dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski backpacking is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski racing.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but is usually not included, the latter being done on steep slopes and requiring much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat greater distances than walking, but only very rarely will you gain skiing speeds on prepared ski runs without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean submitting visa applications several times and going through passport control procedures.
But in this respect, the Schengen area works like one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen country, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies classify items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition depends on geographical variations, where the era boundary may be narrower in North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sami and surrounding culture, and trade is also important for many in other professions.
Even traditionally, although not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, keeping reindeer as the main breeding animal.
Today, many Sami work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland among the Sami.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Bushmen, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Bushmen.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, this may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
Written consultations are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views expressed are damning, general and oversimplified, unlike the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of severe weather that can occur depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be alert for any severe weather hazards that may affect their area, as this in turn may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who plans to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should get professional training.
If you go online and search for "hostile environment training", you'll probably find a local company.
The course will typically cover all of the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually through hands-on experience.
Training will typically last two to five days and will include role-playing, mostly first aid information and sometimes weapons skills.
Desert survival books and magazines are popular, but war zone publications are scarce.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documentation for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to monitor the preservation of these documents is just as variable.
In the post-September 11, 2001 era, checkpoints have become even more tedious.
In the pre-surgery phase, transgender people shouldn't expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backward flow of waves that form after hitting a beach, often a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topography, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper areas, and in deep water, a strong current can be generated there.
Many deaths result from exhausting attempts to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be as difficult as it used to be.
Try to find places where you won't be raped again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for help.
Rebound shock comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, when you've adapted to a new culture and lost the habits of your homeland.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, realizing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
One of the highlights of the children's area is the sound and light show of the pyramids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the silence before the show.
Usually, you always hear the voice of tourists and vendors, and the story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The swans are positioned as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and then different pyramids are illuminated.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, in the municipality of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano creates a spectacular natural harbor scene.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula converge here, forming a plateau, and then re-converge to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Range, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas where there's no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally speaking, a satellite phone is not a substitute for a cell phone, because in order to make a phone call, you have to be out in the open with a clear line of sight to the satellite dish.
The service is often used by freight forwarders, including yachts, as well as expedition groups whose data is received remotely and have voice needs.
Your local telephone company should be able to give you more information about how to connect.
Travel and learning is becoming an increasingly popular option for procrastinators.
This is especially popular with undergraduates, allowing them to take a year off before college without interrupting their education.
In many cases, taking a deferment course abroad can actually improve your chances of transferring to a higher education institution in your home country.
There's usually a tuition fee to get into these programs.
Finland is a major shipping port. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands in the lakes and offshore archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat.
While offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even docks provide a completely different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with seven or eight people in each boat.
It corresponds to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite exceptional elsewhere (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
A feature of most memorable Baltic cruises is a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days, returning and sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore via boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
In the brochures, some cruises show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, there is no sea near Berlin, and the city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic accident.
It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's no different from the personal fears and insecurities that a lot of people have.
For some, having some understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or uncontrollable.
Freight forwarders are well paid for getting goods to their destinations quickly. Time is often of the essence for business documents, merchandise, or urgently needed repair parts.
On some routes, the larger carriers have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller carriers, this has been a problem.
If they send the goods by air, on some routes it can take days to go through customs and unloading.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations would not allow them to send their luggage to a destination country without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, convince your airline to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap; in practice, you can typically expect to pay up to four times more for business class than economy, and 11 times more for first class.
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights to get from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, thriving commercial center situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers stand out with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the courtyard of the monastery, on some tombs, there are marble sculptures of doves.
It's worth half an hour's walk to the charming village.
To the north and close by is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's vivid accounts of its exploits.
The ScotRail Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the majestic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima, known worldwide as the site of the apparition of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a vast cemetery, as well as a site of almost incalculable value to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many, both Jews and non-Jews, who had loved ones who were killed or worked there until they died.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not disturb the site by scratching signs or graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, many signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
What's more, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other institutions.
Routine announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled disruptions are announced by the automated system in a number of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Pharisees have a reputation for being self-centered, rigid, and self-righteous.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to fit in in Paris is to behave in your typical manner, as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make adjusting to the city much easier.
The Parisians' gruff appearance will quickly disappear if you display a few basic signs of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with spruce, pine and fir trees, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide diversity of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, different soil types, and different elevation levels.
The area is also home to many species of animals and birds.
There are rare species such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shawls for unclothed women, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, a monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pantry at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you won't feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine is similar to the cuisine of similar Mediterranean areas, based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) with olive oil used throughout.
Pa amb oli is a simple popular evening meal, especially in summer, with bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any spices, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
For you, all nouns with the word Sie always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and direct questions.
Arguably, it also makes it easier to read, although writing is a bit tricky when you need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used in the nominative case.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written
You have to be careful with si and ji, because they sound different depending on the vowel that comes after them.
Also, make sure you pronounce the r's and rr's differently: caro means "dear", while "carro" means "chariot".
Persian is relatively easy and has mostly regular grammar.
However, reading this elementary grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to Spanish that there is no need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually disused and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in the past as it is today, they're usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to get to than the ones that are being built today.
The most advanced research telescopes are huge structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Whale watching, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first balls were hosted only by the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants do best in natural settings, so resist the temptation to pick just one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting specimens without discussion will also drive you crazy.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, and it's very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, being located in the "high tropics", a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are about to board will take you to Hebron and not to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or interesting cities on the Danube by sea or sailing on the Erie Canal.
They also determine popular hiking and biking trails.
One of the most important holidays for Christians is Christmas, celebrated to mark the birth of Jesus.
Many Christmas traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of staying up on Easter night to see the sunrise at some visible point.
Of course, there are Christian, theological explanations for this tradition, but it was most likely a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold Easter Vigil services on Easter weekend, Saturday night, with communities often beginning to celebrate the resurrection of Christ as midnight strikes.
All the animals that came to the islands originally came either by swimming or by flying or by drifting.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, leaving the giant tortoise as the Galapagos' main grazer.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have appeared, including goats, horses, cows, rats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or the Antarctic in the winter, you'll see the polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights when the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The suit is casual business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, emphasizing the efforts of the group more than praising individual achievements.
Employees must often seek approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
