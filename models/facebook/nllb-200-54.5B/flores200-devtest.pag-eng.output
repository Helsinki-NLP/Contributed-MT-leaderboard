Not only does it confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a popular theory, but it reveals details that fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists describe the animal's coat as chestnut brown above and lighter orange below.
This finding has provided insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur lacked a strong attachment called the rachis, but had other features - barbs and barbules - researchers believe that the rachis likely evolved to support these additional features.
Researchers say that even if this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, a sample would show that it is the tail of an adult and not that of a chicken.

Of the 1,400 people surveyed for the 2010 federal election, those who disapproved of Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated in the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic following the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared this view, preferring Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the poll's conclusion, 29 percent believed that Australia should become a republic immediately, while 31 percent were not sure that Australia would ever become one.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays was unable to compete because of emotional problems.
He could not take the medicine he needed to fight the disease because his senses had been dulled.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a famous random number dated January 25.

NextGen is a system that the FAA says will shorten the flight paths of planes to save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce smog
Satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint the exact location of an aircraft and provide the pilot with accurate information.
There are no extra trains from and to Wembley, and there are no car parks or park-and-ride facilities.
The fear of possible car accidents may lead to playing in secret away from the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in a journal of the journal Science reported on the formation of bird nests in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the scent of birds has changed after two generations, although the process is much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be cut into various shapes and patterns.
It could be shaped like an amber and polished, or it could be ground into a powder.
It could also be rolled up tightly and glued to some other metal. It could be carefully rolled up to decorate Hebrew illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using a pH scale.
The refractive index determines color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons stripped of surrounding electrons (Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
The mixture is made by taking two dry powders and pressing them into a smooth paste.
The friction on the hands reacts with the outer layer of skin where the friction is softened to form mucus.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Evidence of ancient sewers has been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where groups of men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in the sky receives the call and relays it to the intended recipient.
Satellites have been launched into space by space rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks light and our view.
It takes a huge rocket 100 feet high to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The world is changing in amazing ways. One of the biggest changes is light and efficient transportation.
There are trains, automobiles, and other means of transportation.
Among them were some of the world's largest cats, which contained the finest muscle tissue from rabbits as well as antelopes and elephants.
Finally, domestic cats (including domestic cats) feed on lizards, frogs, ticks and birds.
Their secret is knowing the right people in the right places at the right times to catch them off guard.
Lions are the feline's best friends, living in groups called prides.
The pride is composed of one to three relatives, including about thirty females and their offspring.
Females are closely related to one another through the maternal lineages of both brothers and their daughters.
Male Lions are as sociable as Bears or Dogs, as do Lions (but unlike cat owners) in behavior, and are always aggressive towards their prey.
Like a skilled athlete, the tiger can run (but not very well) swim, leap great distances, and pull five times as much weight as the strongest man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
Tiger monkeys are not as aggressive as lions, but they can roar for a long time.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rats, and chickens when possible.
Scientists have hypothesized that ocelots follow their prey by detecting odors, sensing their location on the ground.
Ocelots are also adept at hunting their prey by locating a bright spot and making sudden movements toward it.
When small populations of organisms are isolated from other groups, (such as in floodplains or rivers or on remote islands that are difficult to reach), they can adapt to their environment as they normally would.
If their new home has a different lifestyle and there are predators, the new group will develop ways to adapt to survive beyond what they were previously used to.
Former companions who refused to change were still expected to conform to the same standards.
Over time, as the new group adapts to its new environment, it becomes differentiated from other groups.
Until the end of the Millennium or even millions of years, these separate groups will not have the same beliefs and will not necessarily be the same species.
We call this differentiation, which simply means that the two species diverged, an inevitable consequence and a necessary part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe, and humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants absorb.
Plants generate their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our houses out of plants and we make our clothes out of plants. Almost all our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals would die.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, and it was feared not only by its own kind but also by others.
Its long jaws, filled with up to 70 sharp teeth, coupled with the rest of its upper jaw, make it virtually invulnerable.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other crustaceans, and possibly a mate.
It also attacked anything that ventured into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex was no match for it.
Most Roman dishes are familiar to us, but they included such exotic or unusual items as wild boar, peacock feathers, bison, and dormouse
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting down, the rich men wanted to feast together and sit at the side while eating.
The diet of the ancient Romans did not include foods imported into Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central temple, viewing it as a separate house of worship.
The people brought offerings to their gods, and the priests attended to the needs of the gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
At times, temple towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple complex.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not important.
Hebrew families usually lived outside the camp.
Women cooked in the open air; markets lined the streets; stone was used to build houses.
In Canaan, forests were scarce and timber was expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever the case, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have distinct peoples, kings, customs, and histories.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think of a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There is writing on the back of the document, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" appear, with the text reversed.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its composition, the large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So the notation was evidently added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France but not the south.
Under the Vichy regime, some French citizens had been friendly toward the Germans since 1940, and they cooperated rather than fight.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched Operation Dragoon, an invasion of northern France.
The Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France two weeks later, and they advanced into Germany.
A civilization is made up of people who share a common culture in order to work together to form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, corresponding to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, which also denotes the size of a society.
The culture of a civilization is passed on from one generation to the next.
Minor cultures tend to disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence and without being recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only member - under the Articles of Federation.
Congress does not have the power to impose taxes, and in the absence of a unified executive or judicial branch, taxation is left to the discretion of state governments, which do not cooperate in enforcing the law.
He also had no authority to interfere with the states' tax laws.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be changed and did not burden the federal government with long delays.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports in the North are well-known, with Italians competing in international and Olympic events.
Japan has 7,000 islands, 7th largest in the world!
Japan is called an "archipelago" because the islands are grouped together
In the 15th century, a European ship sailing to Ilha Formosa, the beautiful island of Taiwan, passed by the island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company based in Taiwan had a sugar plantation and Chinese laborers.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the Taiwan Coastal area and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three structures, they are Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
A typical cotton mill has been restored as a tourist attraction.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored and is still being restored.
A photographic plate measures 35 mm, the same size as analog film.
This is still used today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm caliber was unreliable, being 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio is 3:2.
Most formats (such as APS format) are close to the ratio.
Keep the image proportional to its dynamic range.
An effective way to take a picture is to cut it into slices.
These developments in Europe during the Middle Ages challenged the wealth and power of the Catholic Church.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European nations across linguistic and cultural boundaries.
His influence extended from the king to the common man.
One of the main objectives of Christianity is to use wealth to alleviate suffering, and funds have been set up for that purpose.
The church's supreme authority had been based in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this source of power and income made many question whether the church was living up to its ideals.
After hostilities ceased, Britain invaded Germany.
The siege was effective, cutting off military aid and supplies, and, although this attack was illegal, it was eventually accepted by the international community.
Britain closed the international shipping lanes to shipping in all parts of the sea, posing a threat even to neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
Pacifism and isolationism characterized the 1920's.
The horrors and atrocities of World War I were things that people did not want to repeat.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York city.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) for Thomas Edison.
China had a unique period, each family having a dynasty.
Each dynasty had three provinces. This was known as the Three Kingdoms for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
In this period of time the rich fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the deadliest period in Chinese history, as rivalries for the throne in the court of Xian were common.
A political and social phenomenon is nationalism, the belief that the nation belongs to all the people rather than to some individual ruler.
After the Revolution, ambitious and successful men were given job opportunities.
Membership in the army was also determined by rank.
The French Revolution inspired revolutions in other countries.
Muhammad was interested in the afterlife. He often went to a cave called "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" to meditate.
He has made this cave a spiritual house.
From the top of a mountain in Mecca, this cave is visible.
It is not easy to find. Entering a cave is a peaceful experience.
You could see nothing but clouds and mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is counted among the seven wonders.
This Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians for the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), many smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the great Sphinx.
Pharaoh Khufu and the pyramids, temples and tombs built for Khufu's wife and family members.
The up bow is V-shaped, and the down bow is curved.
Starting at the tip of the frog's head, push the bow, then the bow, then the frog, and then pull the bow.
The up-bow has a soft sound, the down-bow is loud and forceful.
A custom pencil mark can be used, or a printed bowing mark can be used.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were escorted back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women on October 6, 1789.
As they rode home, a mob formed around them, shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their car windows.
On one occasion, a man beheaded a royal guard at Versailles before the Queen's horrified eyes.
The cost of U.S. imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines was borne by Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. government to pay for the expenses and the rent charged to the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the long conquest of the Philippines brought great wealth to U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand some of the reasons why they were organized.
The age in which the action takes place is known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages gave way to the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which reached a peak around 1500.
The scope of the term techonological determinism in its actual application ranges widely, from the point of view that technology drives everything to the narrow view that human destiny is guided by a scientific logic and is determined by technology.
Two ideas emerge from most definitions of technological determinism: that technology moves forward independently of cultural or political influences, and that because of this, technology itself influences people, rather than people influencing it.
For example, one might say that the presence of automobiles pushes the need for roads.
However, the cost of maintaining a nation's roads would be prohibitive if only a few cars were built, so new methods of automobile production are being studied to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The proliferation of automobiles has also contributed to an increase in traffic accidents, prompting the development of new treatments to repair the damage caused by accidents.
Romanticism played a major role in the development of cultural determinism, exemplified by writers such as Geothe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, people were shaped by geography, and customs and cultures developed that were tied to geography, and because these conformed to the wishes of the community, they were superior to man-made laws.
If Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was a famous center of luxury from about 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
Its fortunes declined during the twelfth century mainly because caravans returned with silks and spices more expensive than those sold in Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the Middle Ages and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Nevertheless, because of the slow pace of communication, a western style may last 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own styles, and one of the greatest achievements of the crusades was the introduction of the button.
Subsistence farming was designed to produce enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is relatively simple, usually organic, using seeds collected from the ecoregion and combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and that is still true in many developing lands.
Cultures unite people who have been marginalized.
Cultures differ by ethnicity, class, age, location and gender.
Cultures are distinguished by language, values, religion, politics, gender, geography and so on.
Members of a culture are identified by style, fashion, mannerism, and class.
One way that socialization can be applied is to help children who have been abused, neglected, and neglected during childhood.
Abandoned children are taken in by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is the result of a parent's refusal to accept a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Vulnerable children are abused before they are abandoned.
Others say that they lived alone and with animals while growing up.
Because fearful children grow up to be very different from normal children.
If project-based learning is supposed to make learning easy and interesting, scaffolding goes beyond that.
Scaffolding is a learning method that helps a learner to expand his knowledge and accomplish a project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical, such as teaching using Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding can be implemented in software and is designed to ask questions, explore, and explain the rules that the student should learn.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including to prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation.
A child deserves to grow up protected, cared for, and educated.
Foster Care is a safe haven for children.
A foster care facility provides a safe home, loving caregivers, and access to education and health care.
Foster care gives children everything they need.
The Internet has combined elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet's remarkable potential has led to its widespread use and wide acceptance.
For example, "education" and "belief" have been cited as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "growing relationships" were identified as new motivations by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they surveyed people on websites.
The use of video recording is essential to capture every second of facial expression.
The expression on a person's face tells whether he is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in "The President's Speech", notes that a speech that is difficult to understand is just as difficult to authenticate.
He adds that the ability to interpret human behavior can also be acquired by a pet dog.
In the 20th century, it was discovered that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds genetic variation, removing selection from expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination went on for generations.
Outside the savanna, a monkey with a digestive system like a human's struggles to obtain the amino acids it needs from plants.
But the real problem is depression, malnutrition, and death.
Legumes and leaves are rich sources of protein, but they are difficult to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digested and high in protein which provides amino acids.
We should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem, as did the savannahs.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking during sleep and returning to sleep (10-60 minutes).
An alarm clock is a wake-up call.
Putting an alarm clock in another room may help awaken someone who is sleeping.
Drinking water or tea before going to bed can help you to wake up refreshed.
Peace of mind transcends physical and spiritual tension.
A stress-free life is positive. It brings peace and contentment.
Everyone can receive encouragement. Negative thinking and stress are destructive.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been greatly influenced by the mahayana and the techniques of Indian Yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the practice of love.
In Kundalini yoga, breathing exercises, yoga postures and visualization are performed.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is Diety yoga, in which visualizations of the gods purify the blood, energize the chakras, and enlighten the mind.
After World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States supported Germany.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were at one another's throats, and the Cold War began.
Forty years have passed,from war in Africa to Asia,in Afghanistan,Cuba and elsewhere.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed and the allies withdrew.
This plan was foiled when 800,000 Soviet troops invaded Poland after the Belgo-Polish Peace Treaty had been signed.
The use of cargo ships helped to alert people.
The navy's job is to protect people and their property, as well as to protect the country from disaster.
With British help, the United States was able to navigate the North Atlantic using sailing ships.
The German navy, with its U-boats, also tried to blockade the trade.
The alliance had failed, and Germany might conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes secreted it for easy use in milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Female goats were herded with cattle that were herded from one area to another, usually young or somewhat older goats, similar to the more familiar herding methods still used today.
Wagonways were developed in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the chariot's wheels were made of planks laid side by side, they enabled the horses to run faster and to pull loads that were heavier than paved roads.
Railroad ties were an effective means of keeping the rails stable, but it was soon discovered that iron rails gave better traction.
Most people did, but the iron would soon chafe the wooden wheels of the chariot.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the first railway with an iron track was put into operation.
The earliest form of transport was walking, which evolved into upright walking about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus.
Their successor, Australopithecus, was not accustomed to walking upright.
Fossil evidence shows that Australopithecus walked on two legs 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked even earlier, some seven million years ago.
We can live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can participate in ecological projects, and we can even become activists in efforts to reduce suffering in the future.
But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem, as it were, and deal with it.
Advances in science and technology have dramatically changed the world, and the problems of overpopulation and poverty are increasing.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a five-page document signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now called "Deluge broadsides", were produced overnight.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon behind Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are among the oldest copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived into modern times - birds.
Many people think that they are not dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.
But there are many birds that look like dinosaurs.
They had scissor-like feet and claws, produced sounds, and walked on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Symptoms, such as dizziness, may be so common that it is not possible to diagnose it immediately.
The main symptom of poisoning is exposure to open containers of medicine or poisonous chemicals.
Read the instructions on the packaging carefully.
Entomologists formally use the term 'bug' for this group of insects.
The term comes from the long-known ability of bedbugs to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bedbugs are said to be 'nidicolous,' able to live either in the nest or in their host.
In the United States, about 400,000 people have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading cause of disability among youths and young adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
According to studies, twice as many women as men have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a baby.
Such couples may plan to adopt a child.
Adoption removes the natural parents from the custody of the children and places them with another couple.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand the natural world by applying the scientific method, which, in fact, governs most scientific research.
In addition, experiments and tests are used to rule out one or more possible theories, questions, and observations and to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on primary texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As Greek learning declined, the West severed its ties with philosophy and science.
Many observe that animal and plant life thrives and flourishes by interacting with one another and with their environment.
The occasional burst of life that does not occur spontaneously is documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks have a self-timer that never stops ticking.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA is inherited.
Hershey and Chase used viruses to make more bacteria from their DNA.
In two experiments, they labeled viral DNA with radioactive phosphorus or viral proteins with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the hereditary factor, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only variations in germ-line cells are passed on to offspring, but foreign variations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature based tourism attracts nature enthusiasts who enjoy nature, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities are hunting,fishing,photography,bird watching,and going to the park and studying the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their villages to go to work, while others cross the border to work in their fields.
This privately owned shuttle is nevertheless connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science tells of a massive carbon economy that knocked the biosphere out of the stable state that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone cooperates with society and uses the transportation system.
In the developed world, you rarely hear complaints about poor water quality or broken bridges.
Why does the transportation system have compacts,why do they not happen every day?Are transportation engineers trustworthy?Or is there a fundamental cause?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two intersections.
But studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is 100 percent unpredictable.
Fortunately, modern-day drivers are more reasonable, and this may even make traffic more predictable and predictable.
To understand traffic flow, consider the relationship between (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of the highway facility.
Insects were the first to take to the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to outrun predators, find food, and find mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back over their body.
This gave them an opportunity to flee from the enemy.
Today, bats and mayflies are the only insects that do not fold their wings.
Several thousand years ago, Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believed him and others did not; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It would seem so, for the earth does not rotate, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river on Earth, with a water volume more than eight times that of the world's oceans.
At six miles [6 km] wide, the Amazon is one of the widest rivers on Earth.
Twenty percent of the water flowing down the Amazon River enters the ocean.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387km (3,980 miles) long and collects the waters of many smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building came at the end of the old kingdom, the pyramid of Giza is unsurpassed in structure and beauty.
Egypt's New Kingdom is noted for its architectural monuments and endured for a thousand years.
Vatican city has a population of 800. It is the smallest and least densely populated city in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian was the common language throughout the city, and Latin was used in religious services.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have learned about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, which occur naturally and are used in everyday life.
Aristotle,a philosopher,discovered that all things have one or four elements.These are earth,water,air and fire.
Four types of matter - solid, gas, liquid, and plasma - are thought to undergo chemical reactions to form new substances.
An alloy is a combination of two or more metals.
The elements potassium and calcium are considered metals, as are metals such as silver and gold.
Other alloys contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe came from matter. All matter is made up of atoms.
Even the tiniest atom is awe-inspiring in that its trillions of atoms could fit on a speck of paper.
The pencil became everyone's friend.
Sadly, with the advent of mass-produced writing instruments, the pencil has fallen into disuse.
People use computers to communicate without typing.
One might think that the keyboard would be invaluable.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.

For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina designed an annual Web site about their trip to the State Capital, redesigning the site each year but not removing the old version to make a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often start out with grammatical and spelling errors when they share their experiences, their audience can help correct them.
Since mistakes are often noticed by students, a blogger works hard to improve his writing so as not to be criticized.
Also, blogging "makes students more aware of what's going on in their communities", and by keeping their audience engaged, it helps students become more knowledgeable and interesting about their topic (Toto, 2004).
Blogging also encourages collaboration, helping students to learn outside the traditional classroom.
The proper use of a blog "encourages students to explore and think more deeply; by commenting on what they read online, they can share their opinions on what others have written and express their own views on a particular topic".
