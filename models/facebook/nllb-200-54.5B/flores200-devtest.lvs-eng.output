Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widely held, but it also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut on top and carotenoid on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed leg called a tail, but had the other features of feathers, namely, barbs and spurs, the researchers concluded that the tail must have evolved later than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display.
The researchers suggested that although this is a new dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not juvenile plumage.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon affects the earth to produce tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo around the galaxy, and it's made up of many small particles.

Elections in France have never used much technology: voters go into the polling booth, put a printed page with the name of the candidate they want in an envelope.
After the identity of the voter has been verified by the officials, the voter shall throw the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voting register.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process.

She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony is likely to be useless as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists seem to be treading a fine line by publishing suspect photographs and other information".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, has instructed journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to a dispute over borders that the Palestinians want based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the contract, but PI agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The woodlot had to be carefully managed by the shooters participating in the additional pest control experiment, as this experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Skilled volunteers were recruited through a partnership between the NSWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) and the Sport Shooting Association's hunting programme.
According to Mika O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation had undergone comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martell's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission urged the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was in Martelli in response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.

Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires in which four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) reports that it is aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "minor".
The Department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 am local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been released, but at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as a Filipino photographer, were quickly released.
The photographer later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Lygin followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and joined the Women's National Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his spare time, Ligin began researching premature births.
His studies show that when the hormone is administered, it speeds up the development of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered two "black boxes", the flight data recorders.
Luna was also honored by the other dwarfs who accompanied her.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. Luna was my first manager. Luna died the night there were two moons. Very unique, like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Runnels, known as "Goldust", commented that "Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even weirder...love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic following the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The conflicting results of the poll show that 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is being questioned because of his complaints.
He was not allowed to take painkillers, which are forbidden in the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime to date.
By early February, the discovery had been verified by several people using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have delivered water to Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, in particular, how the Earth formed because of cometary impacts long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and rubbish".

NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow the plane to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of pilots with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no plans to add additional vehicles, surface trains will not stop at Wembley Stadium, but parking and park and ride facilities will not be available at this location.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (U.S.A.) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that a new species has appeared in just two generations, whereas it was thought that the process took much longer because of breeding between the endemic Darwin's and the migratory cactus weevils.
Gold can be cast into all sorts of shapes and can even be rolled into very small objects.
It can be stretched into a small wire that can be bent and twisted, dried, or formed into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women went together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, a satellite receives a call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of the light we see.
Launching a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing the bicycle has done for us is it's given us much easier and much faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Then there are a number of medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a much wider variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche - a specific task that each cat performs and that prevents competition.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and their young.
Mothers are usually closely related to one another in a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs - both strikingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) - and are just as deadly to their prey.
The athletic tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like that of a full-throated lion but is more like a harsh, piercing utterance.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and will take monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, following the scent trail left on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and are also very good at moving around.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they move up a mountain range or river or move to a new island so they can't move back as easily), they will often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they had to be before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new inhabitants begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called a single species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants get their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the greatest predator of its day, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
With more than 70 very sharp teeth in its long jaws, supplemented by extra teeth in the roof of its mouth, anyone coming in its way had no chance of survival.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a tongue of some kind, it may have eaten tortoises, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked just about anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't handle it.
Although most Roman foods are familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual holiday foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and rodents called susuri.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, while the rich men liked to share their meals lying on their sides.
The ancient Roman diet certainly did not include foods that were introduced into Europe from the Americas or Asia only centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central temple, which they viewed as the dwelling of a god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to supply the needs of the gods by performing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not of great importance.
Most Jewish families lived out-of-doors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, and timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the old Norse sagas tell us that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he discovered a land he called Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, there were many differences between the nations, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasures, you might assume that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, this large vellum document was rolled up and put away shortly after it was written.
So the note is most likely attached simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was run by All France, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were marching toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture made up of an extremely large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", meaning civilian, related to the Latin "civis", meaning citizen, and "civitas", meaning city or city-state, and it also sort of defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations.The culture of a civilisation means the transmission of knowledge across generations, the lasting impact of culture and its even spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as fully developed civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, for the first time established a weak central government whose only component was Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on often uncooperative state institutions to enforce any laws it passed.
It also did not have the power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The unanimous consent of all the states was required to amend the Articles, but the lax attitude of the states toward the central government often prevented their representatives from attending.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago" because of its many islands
Taiwan got its start in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in local grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and announced the incorporation of Taiwan as a province into the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed to give tourists a better understanding of how they were originally constructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common photographic film size in the analogue photographic film era.
It is still in production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually, slightly confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format set) conform to or are very similar to these image edge ratios.
The much-distorted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the order of the image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under attack.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European countries despite their different languages and traditions.
This all-embracing authority affected everyone, from the king down to the common people.
One of the central doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are earmarked for that very purpose.
The centralized power of the church in Rome for more than a thousand years has led many to question whether this principle is being observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most people and nations.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repetition.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former supervisor, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each period of Chinese history, or each family that ruled, was a different dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was a period of unstable divided provinces, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for supremacy in the Great Wall of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, all male candidates could apply, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true in the military field, since army service ranks were now assigned on the basis of a person's qualities rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in otherworldly matters, and he often went to the cave that became known as Hira al Noor (Mountain of Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived the ravages of time, clearly demonstrates Muhammad's quest for spirituality.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, Ala is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if one knew it existed.
From inside the cave, not much of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many giant pyramid structures erected in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
the 'upward-facing' mark shall have the shape of a V and the 'downward-facing' mark shall have the shape of a square or rectangle with no bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and press the bow, down means you should start at the handle (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more forceful and convincing.
You can mark your notes, but remember that the printed notes are for the benefit of the music and should normally be obeyed.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
Following the crowd in a carriage, they returned to Paris, shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the gang waved the severed head of a royal guard slain at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The cost of US imperialism's war to conquer the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds on behalf of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the surplus from the long exploitation of the Filipino people was the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the environment that motivated the creation of the Order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their expression in technology.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, two main ideas are distinguished: that technological development itself occurs largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technologies themselves produce "effects" on societies, and that these effects are derived rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that the automobile definitely contributes to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with car use.
More private cars also mean more accidents, resulting in new ways for health care providers to repair injuries.
Romanticism was heavily influenced by the cultural determinism of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time a culture and attitudes associated with the geographical region in question emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is now considered the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as a center of luxury goods from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century when the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices valued higher than those available in Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that Constantinople lost its status as the fashion capital to Paris.
The Gothic style became popular in the 10th and 11th centuries and later in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, fashion in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practised to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds collected in an ecoregion along with crops or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be diverse in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the participants.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often emphasize their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization is through unsuccessful case studies of children whose parents failed to provide socialization during their upbringing due to neglect, difficulty, or deliberate malice.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment occurred because the parents rejected the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some say they lived alone in the wild.
Raised entirely with animals, a feral child exhibits almost the same behaviour (with physical limitations) as the animal that cares for it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, but support is a step forward.
The supportive approach is not a learning method, but rather a means of supporting people who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Voting can happen both virtually and physically, in other words, how a voice can be a teacher, but also a little squishy person in a Microsoft Office program.
Virtual meetings are internalised in the software and are designed to ask, present and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, but it is.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The host families must provide everything that was missing in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet create additional dimensions in terms of access to use and enjoyment.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are cited as important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In a study of the target audience's reaction to websites, Amy and McCord (1998) also identified 'personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' as new motivational aspects.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions - facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge its truthfulness.
He even speculates that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have the ability to interpret human behavior.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shifted the variation back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to obtain essential amino acids from the plant resources available on the savannah.
Moreover, it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a lot of protein, which contains essential amino acids.
Given all of this, it is not surprising that our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking during normal sleep and then falling asleep again after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you are conscious but not fully awake.
If you are a sleeper, you can set your alarm clock on the other side of the room and get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to be a diuretic) before bedtime to get you up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force there is, the more potential each person has to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own judgment and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga methods.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it involves kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to universal love.
During the practice of Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini (clear) energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, so the Soviet Union and the United States formed a partnership, and when the war ended, their different systems, processes and cultures made them enemies again.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and with the use of paramilitary armies, real warfare was conducted on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenders were already defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is still the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your nation maintains the ability to move its people and goods while disrupting the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have conquered Britain along with the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes cultivated them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds on hillsides and other pasture grounds under the supervision of goat herders, often children or adults, similar to the more familiar sheep herders.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn carriages consisted only of parallel wooden rails, they allowed horses to travel faster and carry heavier loads than on the bumpy roads of the day.
The sleepers were initially used to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be even more effective if they were topped with metal.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
Bipeds had already been found in Australopithecus ancestral fossils dating to between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although coelacanths may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and even be activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant life-styles of mankind.
After its passage in Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft of the document, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap broadsides were produced.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have many characteristics that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these are called binary digits, or bits in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting may be so general as to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for first aid instructions for the particular container.
The term "beetle" is used in a formal sense by entomologists.
The term comes from an old association with bed bugs, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predatory and bloodsucking cockroaches are parasitic pests that have adapted to live in or on other bodies.
With an estimated 400,000 cases in the United States, multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a baby.
These couples may choose to adopt a child.
Adoption is the termination of parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to use the scientific method to understand how the world works. In fact, this method is the driving force behind most scientific research.
There is also experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all sciences, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The presence of endogenous cycles and the process by which they are generated, in conjunction with the biological clock, often have a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behaviour.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, are confirmed for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the unit of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are cells of the parental cell line.
Only mutations in the cells of the original cell line can be passed on to the children, but mutations in other cells can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature tourism brings together people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
For example, you can go hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or visit parks and learn about the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to Borneo to photograph and meet orangutans.
Each morning, people from small rural towns drive to their jobs, only to be replaced by others whose jobs are in the area they just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Scientists now point out that a carbon-intensive economy has upset one of the biosphere's steady states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and participates in transport systems.
In the developed world, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are there problems every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour usually has a fairly consistent range, so traffic flows can be given some consistency and can be roughly calculated mathematically.
In order to better reflect traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in infrastructure planning, design and processes.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are mayflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in some places.
The Amazon accounts for 20% of the water that flows into the oceans from all the rivers in the world.
The main stem of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids remained unsurpassed for their size and engineering feats.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the chemical elements gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are all found in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four classical elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This more closely resembled the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, may also be present.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that the single period at the end of this sentence would be made up of trillions of atoms.
So when the sign came along, it was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing systems, its status declined and its use became rare.
Now people type messages on a computer screen, and there is no need for a typewriter.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when a newer invention comes along.
An atom bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, it's like spinning heavy wheels on a hill, and when you split the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and that means they tend to split with little stimulus or just like that.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
It is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and 60 miles [100 km] thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the basaltic plain and thicker below the highlands.
There may have been more lunar mare on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are basically trying to figure out what inspires people or what attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Typically, managers who start managing their former colleagues may exhibit two types of behaviour.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change absolutely everything the team has ever done and turn it into their own achievement.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often creates tension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management might not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (page 109, Larson and LaFasto, 1989) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each of the participants reports.
Why would an organisation want to invest time in such a time-consuming process of building a learning organisation?
Creativity and innovation can be unleashed when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, a process in which the organisation works together to overcome a barrier can encourage the creation of a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can focus on innovation, managers need to create a culture of innovation and an organisation where knowledge is shared and continuous learning takes place.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition, and therefore narrow the field and make it more precise.
Scientists are supported in their research by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important branch of computer science that studies the behavior of technology, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In AI research, machines are made to automate tasks that require programmable actions.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, answering customer questions and making diagnoses, and recognising handwriting, voice and face.
These types of cases have become separate industries focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are embedded in several home computer and video game software applications.
A school trip forms a large part of the learning process.Often the teacher would be happy to take pupils to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual learning tours, where students can sit with their classmates and look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
Virtual sharing of the learning trip is a great way to discuss the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, the Bennett School in North Carolina creates a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year the website is redesigned, but the previous versions are kept online as a history album.
Although students often do not initially pay attention to grammar and spelling when they start writing an essay, the presence of readers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical target audience, the author of the e-mail begins to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
The need to keep the reader interested motivates students to be inquisitive and curious (Toto, 2004).
Writing emails is a way of promoting cooperation and encouraging pupils to learn outside school hours.
Appropriate use of emails "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical thinkers. By actively using materials available on the Internet, students can define their own position in the context of other written content, as well as express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more gives Ontario what many consider to be the true Canada.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated and in some places virtually uninhabited wilderness areas.
A population comparison that surprises many: The number of African-Americans in the United States is much larger than the population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and as far as wildlife is concerned, it is like a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam on a large scale in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travellers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to remove a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to situations that they may view as intrusive, and it is not unusual for a woman to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Don't be afraid to say no to men and reject their attentions (whether they are cultural differences or not, it's still not acceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casablanca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The sultan of Morocco renamed the city Daru-l-Badija, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old city of the medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and trinkets of all kinds.
Goma is a popular tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, just east of the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is sufficiently secure, all visits outside Goma should be reviewed to understand the current fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for treks up Mount Nyiragongo to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking sites in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Because of its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
This was one of the main stops in the Henry Louis Gates PBS documentary "African Wonders of the World".
In sharp contrast with the rest of the country, the city is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier tourist attractions and is considered the most important of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a 'Wild Card' which gives access to certain South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is a place that many tourists consider their main destination.
The cluster of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is like a shimmering bar graph, vividly illustrated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, head off the island to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took over as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps. They contain some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is water/marshland.
Since 1966 the Sunderbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 white-tailed deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially on the eastbound and Jakarta/Bumtang routes, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Ride-share taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Bhutanese Ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese Ngultrums).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is an old bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Loyapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are scheduled to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payaya, who made their living from hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Province of the Great Indies", is the result of a 16th-century interaction between Spanish conquistadores and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since Asunción's founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here several times a year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is fixed to the value of one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
While British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to find out what form of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer when the northern hemisphere experiences winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures in the summer usually exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be deceptively wet, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing.
There is no distinct "wet" and "dry" season: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and just about any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep a safe distance from these large, ferocious, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, bear in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing scented foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous 1889 shipwreck when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
With the exception of a British cruiser, almost 200 American and German ships were sunk.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the center of the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount ruler, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland's two harbours provide many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Coast beaches (Harbour North) are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and pohutukawa trees provide most of the shade.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the exclusive suburbs of Whitehaven, Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not particularly tasty, but pleasant and refreshing.
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're nervous, bottled water is easy to find.
Black coffee is known as espresso, cappuccino is made with a large amount of foam (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but classy.
Trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, but injuries to the reef for these reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, pay attention to all signs and carefully heed safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear on beaches and estuaries between October and April 1770 in the northern part of the city.
Sharks are common, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common ocean dwellers; their main habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agents often have arrangements with specific hotels, although through a travel agent you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to think about the offer or prepare other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of visitors choose to stay in tents, and most of them consider this to be an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be near the epicenter of the action, you have to get there early to find a tent that's close to the music.
Remember: Even if the music has stopped on the main stages, there may still be places where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the tracks, as ice crossing makes a rather scary noise for those most affected by the activity.
St Petersburg cruise ships allow time for sightseeing.Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from the visa requirement (please explain the rules).
Casinos usually try their best to keep their patrons for as long as possible and to make them spend more money.
They usually have special food, beverage and entertainment offerings to keep guests happy and on the premises.
However, alcohol impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of maintaining a clear head.
Anyone intending to drive in polar regions or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
There is little friction on icy and snow-covered roads, so you cannot drive as you would on smooth asphalt.
Snowstorms can dump so much snow in a short period of time that they can cause traffic jams.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow, dust, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic flows largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors' adventures.
The popular term "safari" refers to overland journeys to see the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, so standard equipment will give you a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes male and are best seen with binoculars.
A safari hike (also called bush walk, safari trek, or walking tour) is a trek that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having also done so in 1964.
If you had booked flights and hotels for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have found yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but at the end of March, most cancellation rules related to the coronavirus pandemic are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Many hotels offer ironing boards and irons if they are not available in your room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing high-heeled socks, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or even warp in extreme situations).
There are different types of water treatment, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may be exposed to animal parasites unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause inflammation or, at worst, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases per se or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing humans are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods which are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions, often stretching through isolated rural terrain.
If you are new to country roads, beware of steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The speed limits are much lower than on the previous and following stretches of road - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/ h) - and it is even more important to obey them strictly.
Strangely, though, the cell-phone signal is much stronger here than on other stretches of road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is quite tasty, and in Bavaria it is as rich and varied as in neighbouring Austria to the south.
Fruit pies with apple filling are available all year round, while cherry and plum fillings appear in summer.
Many German pastries are flavored with almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you prefer small, firm, rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared from meat or vegetables with the addition of herbs and spices.
Curry can be either 'dry' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian food reflects the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country's 17,000 islands.
However, without further explanation, the term usually refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a wide range of simple, spicy dishes.
Saddle shoes support the rider's legs, which swing from each side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can cause safety concerns as the rider's legs can become trapped.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his leg is caught in the saddle, he may be dragged to the ground if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leg skin fastenings to fall off the saddles when the rider falls and scrapes them backwards.
The valley of Cochamo, Chile's premier rock-climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of huge granite walls and boulders.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails up its endless cliff faces.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
For many enthusiasts, skiing is a regular part of their travels, and they plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of hide-and-seek is very old - cave paintings depicting hide-and-seekers date back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
The sport of ski mountaineering dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club in Australia was established by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
It is related to, but does not necessarily include, alpine skiing or mountaineering; in the latter case, these activities take place on steeper slopes and require stronger skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover longer distances than you can on foot - but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiers without a heavy backpack and a ready-made track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling across several countries would mean endless visa applications and passport checks.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area operates much like a single country.
While in this area, it is usually possible to cross the border without passport control at border crossing points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each of the Schengen Member States, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax agencies define an antique as goods more than 100 years old.
There are geographical differences in the definition, where the age limit in places such as North America might be lower than in Europe.
Craft items could be called antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer husbandry is essential for the Sami people's livelihood, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, they made their living from fishing, hunting and similar activities, mainly using reindeer as working animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami area of Lapland.
Although the term 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If travel advice is applied to the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may wish to follow the advice of the government of another country, but it is intended for citizens of that country.
As one example, Americans in the Near and Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The guides give only a brief overview of the political situation in one country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather refers to any hazardous natural phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and can vary according to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of destructive weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal natural phenomena are, for example, snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
