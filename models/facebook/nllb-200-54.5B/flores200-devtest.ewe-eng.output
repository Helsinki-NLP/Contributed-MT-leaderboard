Lions are the most social of animals and live in groups called prides
Each pride has three males and thirty females along with cubs
Female lions form a close-knit brother-and-sister family
The behavior of a pride of lions is similar to that of wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions.

The ocelot's diet consists mainly of meat.
Scientists say that the ocelot scents its prey until it finds it in its environment.
The ocelot's night vision enables it to see better at night.
If a species (population) moves away from its place of origin (for example, if it is washed up on a beach; or if it moves to an island and cannot easily return to its place of origin), then it finds itself in a new and different world.
With all the advantages and problems of their new land, the newcomers have developed a knack for naming problems and situations differently from the way they were originally described.
The inhabitants of the land had not changed; they were still divided.
As the new earth gradually receives its inhabitants, their way of life will also change.
And thousands of years from now, the two peoples will be so different that no one will recognize their former unity.
This process is called "speciation", and "speciation" is an irresistible force that causes the human family to expand.
Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store carbon dioxide
Trees make their food from the nutrients in plants. They also provide shade
We build houses and clothe ourselves with wood. We eat a lot of food that comes from trees. Without trees, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus ranked first among the predators of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
It had 70 razor-sharp teeth in its jaws and the same number in its upper jaw, making it invulnerable to attack.
We do not know for sure, but it probably had a backbone of some sort, and its diet included squid, large marine mammals, and other mosasaurs, as well as possibly man.
It attacked everything in its path, even dinosaurs as large as T. rex
Although we will learn about many of their dishes, the Romans had some unusual or unusual foods for their festivals, including potatoes, onions, garlic, and a type of mushroom called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their meals modestly in comfortable chairs, the rich men preferred to feast and enjoy themselves, relaxing at their tables.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not compete with the American or Asian food introduced into Europe a century later.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, or cassava, and no ancient Roman had ever experienced famine.
The Babylonians had a temple for each of their gods, and the temple was considered the house of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the worshipers would try to please the gods by performing rituals and festivals.
Each temple had a large open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, from which only fragments could be removed.
Complex pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes added to the temples.
At the top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing is not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life revolved around the outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyards; shops opened up in the streets; houses were built of stone.
There were no forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
According to Norse chronicles, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his westward journey, he discovered and named Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo mountains were already there.
Although each was a 'Scandinavian' country, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had distinct peoples, kings, cultures, and histories.
If you have ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that behind it is a picture of a treasure.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the scroll, it is not a depiction of the king's treasure.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "The First Declaration of Independence, dated June 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment scroll (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up and sealed quickly in its place.
So it is possible that the inscription is merely a footnote.
The Allied Invasion of Normandy and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was far from free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had sided with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders when they should have been fighting them.
On June 15, 1940, Allied Forces invaded the southern border of France, the invasion being called "Dragoon's Army".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were closing in on Germany.
A nomadic way of life is one in which large numbers of people, living and working together, behave in a certain way.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, to some extent describing the size of the community.
Nations are governed by political systems. A civilized society involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the way people act over time, and the way this behavior is taught to others in the right way.
Rare cultures often disappear without a trace and without a history. They are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
At the end of the Revolutionary War, thirteen states united to declare a republic - with only members of Parliament - under the Articles of Confederation.
Parliament had no power to pass taxes, and in the absence of an executive or judicial branch, it depended on bureaucrats who did not always do their job well and enforce its laws.
He had no authority to enforce international tax laws.
Changes to the Articles required the unanimous consent of the states, and some states were so hostile to the government that their representatives rarely attended conventions.
Among the most successful soccer teams in the world, the Italian national soccer team is second only to the German national soccer team as the reigning world champion, having also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, athletics, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports were more popular in the North, and Italians competed in the Panhellenic Games and the Olympics.
Japan (mainly Honshu) consists of some 7,000 islands, making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its many islands, Japan is more commonly known geographically as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in southwestern Taiwan, revolutionizing the local grain market and hiring Chinese laborers to work its vast rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 soldiers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's eastern and northern coasts and in 1885 proclaimed Taiwan under the Qing Empire
In 1895, following the Qing Empire's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which occupied the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Pichu, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Nearby buildings have been reconstructed to give visitors a taste of the past.
In 1976, Machu Picchu was restored to ninety percent of its former glory, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's smallest film format was 35 millimeters, the standard in the dying days of analog film.
It is still in use today, but mainly in the form of a moving camera that sends back information about the aspect ratio of an image.
Of course, the confusion comes from the fact that the 35-millimeter format is 36 millimeters wide by 24 millimeters high.
The ratio of width to height (twelve divided by a whole number) is 3:2.
Simple image features (e.g. single APN features) are at or near the size of the object image.
The rule of thirds is a rule of thumb that is often misused and misapplied.
More important to the article itself, he says, is where the cracks appear, dividing the picture into three sections: from the top to the bottom (see illustration).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having acquired wealth and power, made a tragic history.
For more than a century, Christianity united European cities despite their linguistic and cultural differences.
From the king down to the rest of the people, this man was infected by his powerful influence.
One of the basic beliefs of Christianity is that the rich can be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the resources of the religious community are available for this purpose.
For more than a century, Rome's high priest wielded great power and wealth, causing many to question whether the Reformation was really happening.
With war imminent, Britain used her navy to blockade Germany.
The ban worked, preventing military and civilian casualties from crossing borders, even though it violated many written laws adopted by desert nations over the previous two centuries.
Britain tried to divert to neutral waters and blockade the sea in every way possible, even damaging innocent ships.
Just as there was no clear answer to this ruse, Germany expected the same of its submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, many nations and nationalities enjoyed peace and independence.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, the nations resolved to prevent such events in the future.
In 1884, Tesla left for America to work with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, a postcard from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a sophisticated way of marking time; each Chinese dynasty was a unique kingdom.
Moreover, each dynasty had its own period of fragmentation, the most famous of which was the 60-year period known as the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In the meantime, a bitter struggle for the throne raged among many nobles.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of Ancient China, when thousands died for daring to sit on the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
The social and political consequences have been far-reaching, including the development of the metric system, the shift from absolute power to civilian rule, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to all its citizens, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Reformation, all men were encouraged to work, and those with good intentions prospered.
Similarly, a soldier's rank is determined, not by his rank, but by his ability.
The French Revolution also encouraged many workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Wanting to know more about the origins of his native tongue, Muhammed would go to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, with its natural setting, reflected Muhammad's keen desire to know more about spiritual matters.
The cave is isolated from the outside world in the mountains to the south of Mecca.
I tell you, if anyone knew where he was, he would not be able to find him.
All that can be seen is a clear blue sky and the surrounding mountains, only a fraction of which are visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is a huge pyramid complex built in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, boasts numerous pyramids (including the largest), numerous small tombs, temples, and a colossal statue of a lion.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
The "upper stick" resembles a V and the "lower stick" resembles a staple, or rectangular sculpture, with its base cut off.
Starting at the neck and pushing the stick forward is called strumming, and starting at the frog (where your hand rests) and pulling back is called strumming.
A violin upright produces a softer sound, whereas a downright violin produces a louder sound.
You can write your own notes in pencil, but remember that violin notes are also there for the music, so they should always be respected.
On May 6, 1789, angry mobs forced a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They boarded a coach and traveled back to Paris when they were surrounded by an angry mob shouting criminal threats against the King and Queen.
The King and Queen were forced by an angry mob to throw open the windows of the palace.
It so happened that in front of the horrified Queen, one of the enraged mobs cut off the head of a member of the royal family who had been executed at Versailles.
The cost of the American spy war, in which the Filipinos were defeated, was borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government in order to recover most of their ill-gotten gains and to repay loans made to the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The real benefits of the Filipino bailout are the result of the U.S. bailout program.
To understand the Templars, you need to know the event that led to their founding.
The period in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, a period of European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were followed by the Early Middle Ages and then by the Late Middle Ages, which also ended in 1500.
Technological determinism is an umbrella term that encompasses a number of theories that have been put forward, such as a preoccupation with the importance of technology and the idea that human destiny is linked to the natural sciences and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of the goal of technological civilization agree on two main points: the promise of technological civilization itself is shaped by culture and political rhetoric, and technological civilization has influenced natural societies more than those with specialized training.
For example, it could be said that the availability of the automobile contributed to better roads.
However, some vehicles simply could not afford wide roads, so new methods were developed to reduce the cost of buying a car.
Overcrowding also increases the number of road accidents, and this has led to the development of a new medical technology, orthopedics.
The previous movement, with its beliefs about human emotions, freedom, and reason, focused largely on the influence of culture, drawing on the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegal.
According to this belief, people were shaped by the environment in which they lived, and over time local cultures developed that were more conducive to social cohesion than the laws imposed on them.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of Europe.
Its fame as a beacon of the city began about 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
Its status reached a peak in the twelfth century, largely because the crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices that were more highly valued than those available in Byzantine markets.
It was then that the name of the capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style became popular between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was mainly associated with Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of poor breeding techniques, it will take 25 or 30 years for the eastern elephants to reach the western ones.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, western Europeans began to breed their own hippopotamuses.
Subsistence farming is the practice of cultivating food solely for the subsistence of the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is relatively simple, often using natural methods, no chemicals, stored seeds from the field, and simple crop rotation or other techniques to increase yields.
Historically, many farmers cultivated their own land and still do in developing lands.
The emergence of new cultures brings together like-minded people who feel bound by the laws of the land and want to rebuild their identity through the group.
New cultures can be divided into different groups according to the age, language, status, location and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics of a newly assimilated culture may include language, dress, religion, politics, gender, or nationality, or a combination of these.
Often, immigrants identify themselves by a unique set of labels, including clothing styles, lifestyles, and a unique language.
A simple way to illustrate the value of social studies is to use tragic examples of children who have been neglected, born under unfavorable circumstances, or treated unfairly in the past.
Some of these rebellious children are grouped together by others (especially parents); in some cases, their condition is related to parental rejection because they are mentally or physically disabled.
Rebellious children may have been severely mistreated before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were thought to have been domesticated by animals; others were said to have rebelled and run away.
When a feral child is raised by nonhuman animals, the child displays certain (superhuman) traits that mimic the behavior of the parent animal, such as its fear of humans or its rebelliousness toward humans.
Whereas task-oriented learning should be easy, distributed learning is more cost-effective.
This assistance is not a learning process but a stimulus to those who are learning a new skill, such as programming or starting a new job.
These help programs can be on the computer and some can also be accessed by the public. This means that the teacher can provide help like the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Computer-assisted programs are computer-based activities to ask questions, memorize facts, and explain procedures that would be difficult for a single student to navigate.
Children are placed in Social Services for a variety of reasons, including parental neglect, abuse, or even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of adequate supervision, food, or education.
We felt that a Child Custody Arrangement would be the best solution for these children.
According to the policy, the Child Welfare Agency should provide children with a safe home, loving caregivers, regular schooling, and good health care.
According to the custom, the Children's Mother was to provide in the Home for the Aged the necessities that were not available in the home from which they had been taken.
The Internet has combined the functions of social networking
The variety of Internet signals brings additional conveniences in terms of use and benefits.
For example, according to (James et al., 1995), studying and socializing are important prerequisites for Internet use.
Eighmey and McCordn (1998) found that sharing and social networking were new senses when studying social networking behavior.
Video capture enabled key insights to be gleaned by interpreting a few facial expressions, such as a twinkle in the eye.
It is well documented that lies can be detected by interpreting subtle patterns.
In his paper, The President, Thomas Sacks describes how people who can understand speech use their brains to determine whether someone is hearing the truth correctly.
It also suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may be able to interpret human behavior.
Research over the past two decades has shown that there were two types of class distinctions: implicit and explicit.
Mutations introduce new traits into organisms or populations, and selection removes them from the population.
The combination and blending of these again changes the landscape from one generation to the next.
A primate with a stomach the size of a human's has a hard time getting the amino acids it needs from plants in a desert environment.
Moreover, its absence would bring dire consequences: delayed growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available nutrients are the proteins found in leaves and roots, which primates like us have difficulty digesting unless they are cooked.
The difference is that animal foods (chickpeas, lentils, eggs) are not only digestible but also provide us with good sources of essential amino acids.
Looking back, we should not be surprised that our ancestors, like modern-day chimpanzees in the wild, searched for an answer to their "protein problem".
REM sleep is a natural process of waking up between normal sleeping hours and shortly after falling asleep again (between 10 and 60 minutes).
You can do this by using a quiet alarm clock to wake you up when you are not fully awake.
If you reset your alarm clock, you may find that it is on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed and cry.
Other natural methods involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which stimulate urination) before going to bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of peacefulness is measured in the last ten percent of his level of physical and spiritual alertness.
Now if you have been trained by it, how much more will you receive in return! But if you have been trained by it, how much more will you receive in return for what you have done.
It is possible for all men to be enlightened, but only those who are enlightened are hindered in their natural selves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been developed by combining the mahayana path of love with many of the Indian techniques of Yoga.
Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhism is a simple religion that incorporates Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kunfalini Yoga, the Kundalini (fire of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, spiritual practices, repetition of a single word, and visualization.
In Tibetan meditation, the focus is on the God of Yoga, through whom energy channels are cleared, chakras energized, and a state of enlightenment restored.
Germany was an international enemy during World War II, which led to the alliance between Russia and its allies and the United States.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become bitter enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It lasted 40 years and was actually fought by allied armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By August 17, 1939, the Polish defenders were scattered, and the only hope for the south was to retreat and rejoin the Roman side.
But these plans were shattered overnight after more than 800,000 Soviet troops joined the armies of Belarus and Ukraine in invading eastern Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other treaties between these two countries and others.
The use of seagoing vessels to transport goods from one place to another was the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Since ancient times, seafarers have played a vital role in ensuring the safety of their nation's cargo and passengers while at the same time denying entry to enemy ships.
A good example of this in recent years was the East Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
In the meantime, the German occupation forces, using only the postal service, tried to suppress this trade.
If their invasion had not succeeded, the Germans would have conquered Britain as they had the rest of Europe.
Camels were apparently domesticated ABOUT 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began breeding zebras and leopards for milk, wool, meat, and cargo.
Domesticated donkeys were herded over hills and pasture, often with children and pets like other herders, a tradition that continues today.
Wagonways were built in England during the last decade of the 16th century.
Even though Wagon Roads had tall trees, horses were allowed to shoot arrows and carry heavier loads than roads that were not as steep.
The use of bracelets was originally intended to improve the accuracy of the measurements. It was noted that the measurements would be more accurate if they were suspended from a metal bar.
This became a common practice, but the iron could corrode wagon wheels.
As time passed, iron filings accumulated on the trees. In 1767, all the iron filings were removed.
The earliest known movement was walking, and humans began walking about two million years ago.
Their foreheads were not used as often.
Bones of bipedal animals have been found in Australopithecus fossils dated to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago; however, Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal only a few hundred million years ago.
You can begin to heal your communities, you can take a proactive approach that will minimize future suffering.
In many respects this is similar to therapy. If so, to find lasting solutions, you need to get to the root of the problem, eliminating alcohol completely.
It seems that the world has changed dramatically as a result of human evolution and technology, and the problems are increasing as the human family evolves along with human civilization.
On the 4th day of the seventh month, President of Congress John Hancock signed a proclamation and sent his secretary of war Charles Thompson to deliver supplies to John Dunlap's hospital.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies of Donald broadsides were printed.
John Nixon delivered the first inaugural address at Independence Hall on the 8th day of the 7th month.
The ribbon was sent to George Washington on the 6th day of the seventh month and distributed to the troops on the 9th day of the seventh month. A copy reached London on the 10th day of the eighth month.
Those 25 Donald broadsides still exist today.
Many paleontologists believe that only one species of dinosaur survives today. You call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs, since they have tusks and feathers.
Birds, however, have much in common with dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Many of today's computerized message-processing systems are based on binary symbols that are arranged like a string of beads.
These binary digits can only have one weight, in numerical terms, either 0 or 1, and these symbols are referred to as least significant digits, for simplicity.
Toxins that enter your body are not readily detectable. Contaminants such as mold cannot be detected because mold comes in many forms.
The first thing you would notice would be the presence of tooth decay or toxic chemicals in the house.
Check the label to make sure it is the right size.
Officially, the term insect pest is used by entomologists when referring to these types of insects.
The name is derived from the presence of the Aboriginal people and the Aboriginal vermin, man-eating insects.
Both assassin and assassin bug bites remain on their mothers long after birth, attaching themselves to the antennae or the target.
Across the United States, 400,000 people suffer from multiple sclerosis, mostly children and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects your brain and nervous system.
Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than in men.
Couples may decide that they do not need children, or the dolls may not fit.
These families will have to arrange for a funeral service to be held for them.
In that case, the child's parents may sign a declaration of paternity stating that the adoption was obtained by other means.
The goal of stochastic processes is to discover how the world works through the use of stochastic processes.
Not only that, but questioning and observation help to complete the picture.
Those who study the fate of the world look to the oldest texts, especially those in Latin of the Bible.
All of Aristotle's ideas about the natural world, including the laws of logic, were adopted.
As the early Greeks noted, Southerners distanced themselves from the Geek idealists.
Many people observe that the appearance of money in the visible or physical world and in the events of life are often the result of important social and ritual events that coincide with the auspicious time.
Excavations have revealed that almost all organisms, especially plants and animals, have self-sustaining cycles of time.
Living things that grow naturally take care of themselves for a while, even when there is no outside source of nourishment and no outside source of heat.
The work of Hershey and Chase was one of the first to suggest that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a virus to create their own brand.
Two methods are used to determine the molecular weight of the target molecule by using radioactive phosphorus poisoning or by metabolizing the molecule using radioactive sulfur poisoning.
A variety of surgical techniques produce different results depending on the type of surgery, the severity of the injury, the materials used and whether or not the diseased tissue is in the oral cavity.
If there is a problem with a person's lymphatic system, it can be passed on to his offspring, causing lymphedema or hemorrhaging.
Nature parks attract nature lovers to enjoy themselves in natural settings, especially where there are plants and animals.
Typical activities at these sites include fishing, swimming, photography, and discussions about aquatic life.
One example is the sightseeing, photography, and discussion of organgatuangs in Borneo.
Very early in the morning, people went out to see what had happened to the demon-possessed men, and all who saw them passed by.
During this time of mourning, many people in one place or another have expressed their support for her cause.
Geology has shown that the world of negative gases now occupies an important pillar of the earth's life-support system, which has dominated human life and its interactions for more than two million years.
This person holds a position in his community and is called טוּב. Almost everyone talks about טוּב.
In developed countries, it is common to hear about water shortages and polluted rivers.
Why do accidents occur, why do explosions occur? Do they indicate that the engineers did not know their job well? Or was something wrong from the start?
Traffic flow refers to the flow of drivers and vehicles and the conversations that occur between them.
Unfortunately, congestion affects traffic flow because the lives of drivers are unpredictable.
Fortunately, drivers always try to obey the law; for example, driving rules or traffic laws are always kept in good order throughout the year.
To improve traffic control, they devised a system: (1) its frequency, (2) its frequency, and (3) its timing.
This network helps them plan and coordinate firefighting efforts.
Insects were the first organisms to fly through the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to attack predators and share food with their mates.
Many insects can tear off their antennae by rubbing them together.
This gives them plenty of room to hide from predators.
Today, insects that cannot fold their wings are known as blowflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus discovered that the planets revolve around the sun.
Some were convinced by what he said, but many were skeptical. The sun began to rise in the east and set in the west.
This is understandable, since the earth seems to be stationary.
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second-longest river.
The Amazon is the largest river system on earth.
About 20 percent of the water that enters the rivers from the land comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon itself is 6,387 miles (3,980 km) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the construction of pyramids in the rocks continued to mark the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids were in no way larger than the Giza pyramid under construction.
Egyptians of the new kingdom marveled at the thousand-year-old monuments carved into their foreheads.
Vatican City has a population of 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian instruments and percussion.
People living in the capital used Italian in everyday life and Latin in their religious services.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It is known that gold, silver, and cups from old mines contained various metals, which could be recovered from the fire and easily made into gold jewelry.
The great philosopher Aristotle identified four basic elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
This is analogous to the four elements in your environment (in that order): rock, liquid, gas, and charcoal.

Some routes were operated by large airlines, but on others, as well as by smaller carriers, there was a problem.
Air freight may take several days to clear customs.
The only way to do that is to pack it in a prepackaged package. Airline regulations prohibit sending a package without a passenger, and there you are.
The only way to get on a high-speed jet or a commuter train is to spend a lot of money for the privilege yourself (or better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, this is not easy. Since they operate according to strict rules, you can expect them to pay four times as much to merchants and eleven times as much to customers.
After all, it makes no sense to ask for directions from one airline to another.
Airlines are well aware that there is a segment of the flying public that is willing to pay top dollar for quick, comfortable flights, and they offer them for a price.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The country's official language is Romanian, but many people speak Russian.
