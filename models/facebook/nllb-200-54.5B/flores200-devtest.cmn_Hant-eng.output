This not only confirms a popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that most fossils do not, such as color and three-dimensional composition.
Scientists say the animal's feathers are chestnut brown on the outside and pale white or peppery on the inside.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of birds' feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, the so-called plumage axis, but did have other feather characteristics, namely feathers and winglets, the researchers reasoned that these other characteristics likely evolved later into the plumage axis.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display.The researchers say that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows that it is an adult feather rather than juvenile down.
Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers in the specimen are fully developed and not newly formed in young animals.

Current research is mainly theoretical, but the aim of this project is to simulate observations of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effects that the team wanted to observe are the result of the interaction of the galaxy's dark matter with the galaxy's own dark matter influencing the tides.
Just as the moon's gravity causes tides on Earth, the galaxy exerts a force on Sagittarius.
In the meantime, scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
The theory claims that most of the dark matter around a galaxy forms a halo and is made up of many particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voter, alone in the voting booth, places a pre-stamped ballot into an envelope identifying the person to be voted for.
After the voter's identity is verified by officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
France's electoral law codifies the voting process very strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of voting, and that no envelopes have been put in except those of authorized voters who have been counted.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process.

This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but the law works differently in Scotland, where the courts have considered the potential prejudice of publishing photographs.
According to Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, "Journalists do seem to be treading on dangerous ground by publishing material such as photos of suspects".
The Royal Prosecutor's Office in Scotland, which is in charge of the overall prosecution, told reporters that it would not comment further, at least until charges are filed.
According to the leaked documents, the document will refer to the Palestinian desire to settle the border dispute based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics in the document reportedly include the future direction of Jerusalem, the holy city shared by both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a 10-year military presence in the Jordan Valley if the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to a five-year military presence.
The hunters participating in the enhanced pest control trials will be closely monitored by the National Park Service as the trials are monitored and evaluated.
The NSW National Parks Service (NPWS) in partnership with the Shooting Sport Association of Australia (NSW) is seeking qualified volunteers for the Shooting Sport Association's hunting program.
According to the Acting Director of the Parks Conservation and Heritage Unit of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Mick O'Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first shoot have undergone extensive safety and training.
Madrid was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
This is the fifth ad hoc electoral commission in Madrid in four years.
As part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections, the Presidential Council last month recommended the resignation of the former ad-hoc election commission.
The committee was set up in Madrid in response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests are motivated by the impossibility of holding elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
In total, about 60 iPod overheating incidents were reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents linked to the device.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy and Industry announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company claimed were "not serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple's delay in reporting the incident "regrettable".
The earthquake struck at 07:19 a.m. local time in the Mariana Islands (09:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said it had not received any reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists and taken them hostage in the Philippine capital Manila.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
They released six hostages, including children and the elderly, as did the Filipino photographer.
Two photographers were later exchanged with an elderly woman who needed to use the toilet.
Lykins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and began his practice at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Sir Liggins was working at the hospital, he used his time after work to study premature births.
His research shows that if a certain hormone is administered, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
On Wednesday, government investigators recovered two "black boxes", the flight recorders, Xinhua news agency reported.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Luna was the first extreme queen...my first manager...Luna passed away on February night, very special, just like her...a strong woman".
Renowned wrestler "Gold Dust" Dustin Runnels commented: "Luna is as weird as I am...maybe even weirder than I am...I love her and will miss her...hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those against Australia becoming a republic were 8% more than in 2008.
Julia Gillard, the caretaker Prime Minister, claimed during her campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II leaves office.
This is the view of 34% of those polled, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Between the two extreme results of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three swimming relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his symptoms have raised questions about his fitness.
He was unable to take painkillers because they were banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known mass number on January 25.
By early February, several people had verified the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was officially announced on Tuesday.
The water on Earth may have been brought here by comets, and the organic matter in the water could form proteins and support life.
Scientists want to understand the formation of planets, especially the Earth, because comets collided with it a long time ago.
The 53-year-old took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political rhetoric and ignorance".
He has been a vocal critic of the government, and is widely seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to shorten flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and significantly reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than the older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There is no alternative transport available, the Metro will not stop at Wembley, and there are no available car parks or parking transfers.
The match could be forced to start without the supporters of the teams being able to refuel due to traffic concerns.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Culinary Sciences reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
While in the past it was thought that new species took longer to evolve, researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have discovered that the new species evolved in just two generations as a hybrid of the endemic Darwin's Geospiza fortes and the exotic cactus Geospiza fortes.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be bent into tiny shapes.
Gold can be stretched into thin threads, wrapped and woven, or hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals. Because it can be made so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate the hand-drawn pictures in a book called "Mud Gold Decorated Manuscripts".
This is called the chemical acidity.You can use the cranberry juice as an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on the acidity of the chemical.
The pH of a chemical substance is based on the amount of potassium ions present in the substance (the H in pH stands for sodium).
Lithium ions are protons that have lost electrons (because lithium atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
The two dry powders are mixed together and then squeezed into balls with clean hands and water.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outside, making them feel weird and forming a shell.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage treatment system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, people have found the remains of sewage systems under their houses.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were also toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths for men and women.
It's a great way to make a phone call to a friend who lives far away.
The satellite in space receives the signal and instantly reflects it back to Earth.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere sometimes distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have changed the world in amazing ways.The greatest contribution of wheels to mankind is that they provide us with easier and faster means of transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars and other means of transportation.
Below them are the more diverse medium-sized cats, which feed mainly on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (occasionally domestic cats) also prey on a large number of small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of success lies in Leakey's idea that each cat has a unique job to do, so they don't compete with each other.
Lions are the most gregarious of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three adult lions and up to 30 lionesses and cubs.
Female lions are usually close relatives, sisters and daughters of the same extended family.
Lions behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very aggressive towards their prey.
Tigers are all-round athletes, able to climb (though not very skillfully), swim, leap long distances and have more than five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers and lions, butterflies and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera onca).
The tiger's roar is not at all like a lion's roar, but more like a confused, shouted word.
They hunt rabbits, snakes and rodents, and birds when they can. Their prey is almost always much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that jaguars use their sense of smell to track and locate prey.
The tiger cat hunts by blending into its surroundings and then pouncing on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a subpopulation) becomes separated from the main group from which they came (e.g. by crossing mountains or rivers, or by moving to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new demographic needs different traits or changes to be more competitive than in the past.
The original population has not changed at all, so it still needs the same adaptation functions as before.
As time passes, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, and their appearance becomes more and more different from others.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
Specialization is an inevitable consequence and an important part of the evolutionary process.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
The plants get their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis, but they also provide shade.
We use plants to build our houses, we use plants to make our clothes, most of the food we eat comes from plants; without plants, animals cannot survive.
They were the top predators of the time, so they weren't afraid of anything except other dragons.
Its long jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and another set of teeth in its upper jaw, indicating that anything that gets in front of its eyes cannot escape.
Although we can't be sure, we think it may have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, other theropod dinosaurs and maybe even its own kind.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like King Kong is no match for it.
Although the food of the Romans is mostly familiar to us, they do eat some strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women sit on the chairs to eat their food, the rich men prefer to join the banquet and lie down between the tables to enjoy their meal.
The ancient Roman diet did not include the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they don't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and Romanians don't eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each god, and the temples were considered the house of the gods.
The people prepare offerings to the gods, and the priests try to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open shrine courtyard followed by an inner sanctum that only priests can enter.
Some of the temples also have special pyramid-shaped towers called "Taj Mahal".
At the top of the tower is a special shrine to God.
In the warmer climates of the Middle East, houses are less important.
The Jewish family spends most of its time outdoors.
Women cooked in their yards; shops were just a counter facing the street.
There are no large areas of forest in Canaan, so timber is especially expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Redhead was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it after himself.
But whatever his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, monarchs, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence depicts a Tibetan treasure.
However, that is not true. Although there is some handwriting on the back of the document, it is not a treasure.
The text on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows who wrote the text, it is certain that the huge vellum document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was created for the early collection.
So it's possible that this sentence was added just to make a point.
The Normandy landings and subsequent campaigns liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French, the "Vichy", who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
Within just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant number of people (or societies) who live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "of the citizens". It is related to the Latin words "civis" and "civitas", meaning "citizen" and "city or city-state" respectively, which in some ways also define the size of a society.
The city-state is the predecessor of the nation, and civilization and culture are the result of the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the continuity of cultural traces, and universal transmission.
In the past, smaller cultures tended to disappear without a trace and could not be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states first established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (with the National Assembly as its only institution).
The National Assembly does not have the power to levy taxes, and since there is no national executive or judicial branch, it must rely on the often uncooperative state powers to enforce laws.
It also does not have the power to revoke inter-state tax laws and tariffs.
These laws require the unanimous consent of all the states to be changed, and the attitude of the states towards the central government is very sloppy and their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern part of the country, where Italians participate in related international and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often classified as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view due to the fact that it has a group/groups of islands.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming indigenous grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work on the company's rice paddies and sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) government took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan by force and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing government ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) with the signing of the Treaty of Weimar.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Pagoda of the Sun, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the site have been rebuilt to give visitors a better idea of what the site looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration efforts continue to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the main format at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted as the standard for photographic elements in digital cameras.
In fact, the format of the 35 hectares is somewhat confusing: 36 meters wide and 24 meters high.
The ratio of length to width in this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (like APS Advanced Photographic System format) are equal or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping the scene orderly.
It states that after dividing the image into three equal parts vertically and horizontally, the intersection of the lines is the most effective position for the subject (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresence affects everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth must be used to help the suffering and the poor, and church funds were created specifically for this reason.
The centralization of power and money in Rome, where for more than a thousand years the Church's center of power has been located, has led many to question whether the Church is really living up to this creed.
Shortly after the war began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
This strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian biological supplies has worked, despite the fact that this blockade violates international norms established over the past two centuries through various international agreements and universally accepted by all countries.
The UK placed mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire area, even to harm neutral ships.
In the meantime, the Germans have decided that their unrestricted submarine warfare will not provoke a strong reaction since there is no reaction from other countries.
In the 1920s, the general attitude of the majority of citizens and the country was pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, countries want to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China used a unique way to represent different periods; different phases of China or different ruling families belonged to different dynasties.
The most famous of these was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Song dynasties.
During these years, there were fierce wars between many nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in China's ancient history, when thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne in the magnificent imperial palace in Xi'an.
The revolution had many social and political implications, such as the adoption of a public system of measurement, the replacement of authoritarianism with republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to monarchs.
After the revolution, all jobs were open to all men who were actively looking for work, leaving the most willing and accomplished to take over.
The same thing happened in the army, because now they don't distinguish ranks by rank, but by merit.
The French Revolution inspired revolutions by the oppressed working class in many other countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the secular world. He often went to meditate in a cave called Hira on Mount Noor.
The cave itself has evolved over time to reflect the dynamic nature of Muhammad's spirit.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain in the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows it's there.
There is nothing to see except the beautiful clear sky above and the surrounding mountains; only a small part of the world inside the cave can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C. and is one of many large pyramids built to honor the late pharaohs.
Located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau, or "Pyramids of Giza", contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest in the world), small mausoleums, temples, and giant humanoid lions.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family members.
The "upper bow" symbol is shaped like a V, and the "lower bow" symbol is shaped like a bookmark or a square with an opening at the bottom.
Up means you should start from the tip of the bow, down means you should start from the bowstring (where your hand is holding the bow).
The upstroke usually represents a softer sound, while the downstroke represents a stronger and firmer sound.
Please feel free to mark them with a pencil, but remember that the bow symbols printed on the page also have a musical function and should not be ignored.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette and their two children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the King's sister, Princess Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from the Palace of Versailles by a group of market women on October 6, 1789.
On their way back to Paris in a carriage, they were surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a member of the mob even waved the head of the Royal Guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the horrified queen.
The cost of the war waged by US imperialism against the Philippines is being paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial power to pay for most of the government's expenses, while the interest on the bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the United States has long exploited the super-high profits made by Filipinos as a basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the organization.
The period in which these events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries of European history (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which is traditionally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term techno-determinism covers a wide range of concepts that have been put into practice, from technology-driven or technology-driven change, to the more rigorous "the laws of science and the associated logic behind the forms of science's expression in technology drive human destiny".
There are two main ideas behind most interpretations of technological determinism: that technology itself has a far greater influence on the course of development than cultural or political factors, and that technology, in turn, "influences", rather than is constrained by, the inherent patterns of society.
For example, some people say that cars will inevitably drive road development.
However, it is not economically viable to build a national highway network for a few cars, and new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
As the number of people owning cars increases, so does the risk of road accidents, leading to the development of new medical technologies to repair injured limbs.
Cultural determinism is one of the important components of Romanticism, drawing heavily on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual and, over time, gives rise to customs and cultures associated with that geographical environment.
Just as Paris was hailed as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was hailed as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its importance declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts of silk and spices, which were more valuable than what was sold in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication, the Western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a distinctive style.
The self-sufficient agriculture is a type of farming where the crops are only enough to keep the farmers and their families warm.
A subsistence agriculture is a simple farming system, usually based on organic farming, preserving and using seeds from crops native to the local ecoregion, using crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase production.
Historically, the majority of farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
The subculture brings together people with similar tastes who also feel ignored by mainstream society, creating a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by the age, race, class, geographic location or gender of their members.
The characteristics that establish a subculture may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a variety of factors.
Members of the subculture often show their belonging to the group through special and symbolic forms, including dress, behavior, and use of sign language.
One way to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the unfortunate cases of children who grow up neglected, unlucky or deliberately mistreated, and therefore do not receive the socialization process given by adults.
In some cases, children are abandoned because their parents do not accept them as mentally or physically handicapped.
According to UNICEF, the number of homeless children in the world has doubled in the past two decades.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to live alone in the wild.
If a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, he will exhibit almost exactly the same behaviors (if the biological conditions allow) as the animals that take care of him, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
The project-based approach makes learning easier and more fun, while the scaffolding approach takes it to the next level.
It is not a method of learning, but a support for those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
In other words, both the teacher and the embroidery needle helper in Microsoft Office are models of a falcon.
Virtual Falcons have been built into the software to ask questions, give hints and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are sent to shelters for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up without nourishment, care and education, but this is not the case.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The adoptive family should provide them with all the necessities they lack in their previous family.
The Internet combines the two elements of mass and personal communication.
The vivid nature of the Internet opens up new horizons in terms of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are both important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) found that "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also new levels of motivation when they surveyed the audience's response to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been suggested that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks points out that people with brain damage who cannot understand a speech can still accurately perceive the speaker's sincerity.
He even suggests that animals such as dogs may have this ability to explain human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of genetic mutations: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new mutations, and natural selection removes them from the gene pool.
In each generation, the two sets of genes, the dominant and the recessive, are separated and rearranged.
The digestive system of primates, similar to humans, has difficulty absorbing enough amino acids from grassland plants.
In addition, insufficient intake of amino acids leads to serious consequences: poor growth and malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant sources to get protein from are the leaves and peas, which are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (chickpeas, egg whites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high-quality proteins with all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if the way our ancestors solved their "protein problem" was similar to that of the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling asleep again within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that keeps you conscious but not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other options based on the menstrual cycle include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a recognized diuretic) before bed, which can make you have to get up to urinate.
The degree of one's inner peace is inversely proportional to the degree of one's physical and mental tension.
The more relaxed you are physically and mentally, the more vitality you have.
The only obstacle to enlightenment is our own anxiety and negative energy.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the Buddhist path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation and the practice of loving embracing all beings.
During kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga movements, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
At the heart of Tibetan Buddhist meditation is the concept of the Self-Realization Yoga.
As the war ended, conflicts over institutions, practices, and culture created a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of World War II, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It has been going on for four decades, with proxy armies fighting real battles on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish front had fallen and the only hope was to retreat and regroup near the Romanian bridgehead.
Over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact of Brest-Litovsk and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, and later moved into Belarus and Ukraine, forming the Belarusian-Ukrainian Front.
Shipping goods by boat is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's mission has been to ensure the safe transfer of people and goods from one country to another, while interfering with the transfer of people and goods from an enemy country.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport personnel and supplies to the other side of the Atlantic to help the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy is trying to block shipping (using mostly U-boats).
If the Allies lose, Germany may conquer Britain as it conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started raising them for milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats are generally grazed on hills or other grazing areas, usually by children or teenage goatherds, similar to the more widely known shepherds.
England built a horse-drawn carriage in the 16th century.
Although four-wheeled freight tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull goods on the track, which was faster and could carry more goods than the slightly rougher roads of the time.
In the early days, railway tracks were secured with railway pads, but gradually it was found that the tracks were more efficient if they were paved.
This became a common practice, but the iron would cause more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriage.
In 1767, the first all-iron railway was built.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, and with the advent of Homo Erectus, humans began walking upright two million years ago.
Their evolutionary ancestors, the southern apes, are not used to walking upright.
Bipedalism has been found in southern ape fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Chadian apes may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can get involved in the environmental movement, we can even become activists to minimize future suffering.
But if we want more than a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and solve it once and for all.
It is obvious that the world has been transformed by the progress of human science and technology, and that the problems are compounded by overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles.
After passing through Parliament on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Chief Clerk Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
It was printed overnight in 150 to 200 copies, and is now known as the "One-Sided Printing of Le Pen".
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and George Washington read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 known extant copies of the Lepe one-sided printing are the oldest surviving versions of the document, and the original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to modern times, which we call birds.
Many people don't think they are a type of dinosaur because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
In fact, all computers today are based on manipulating binary-coded information.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1.
The symptoms of poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Vomiting and other symptoms are too common for a direct diagnosis.
The best way to tell if someone has been poisoned is to find an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
The first aid instructions on the label for that particular poison should be read.
The term "bugs" is the official term used by entomologists to describe these insects.
The name comes from the ancient understanding of bed bugs - highly adapted insects that live as parasites on the human body.
Both hunting lizards and bed bugs have the characteristic of growing in nests and are adapted to live in nests or in the homes of their hosts.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
According to research, women are twice as likely as men to suffer from MS.
In some cases, a couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or the child's best interest to keep the baby.
These couples can choose to plan for the adoption of their children.
Adoption is when a biological parent terminates their parental rights to allow another couple to raise their child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.
But experimentation is not the only method; experimentation is a way of testing one or more hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that can lead to scientific research.
In the past few years, museologists and philosophers have focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of Greek learning, the Western world severed its roots from Greek philosophy and science.
The physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by many scholars are often highly dependent on the biological cycles of the organism and the substances produced by the biological clock.
Not only is the rhythm of the menstrual cycle a response to external cues, it can be observed in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps cycling on its own even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Jones experiment was one of the major experiments that showed that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive iodine to mark the DNA in the bacterium and the other using radioactive sulfur to mark the bacterium's proteins.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell or not, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-themed tours attract nature enthusiasts to enjoy the natural landscape, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
I've been to Borneo to visit, photograph and learn about the red gorilla.
Every morning, a group of people drives from their village to their workplace, passing by another group of people whose starting point is also the destination of another group of people.
In this busy traffic, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of this private car-based transportation system.
Today, science suggests that this massive carbon-based economic activity has thrown the biosphere out of the steady state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system.
You rarely hear similar complaints about water quality and collapsed bridges in developed countries.
I wonder why the transportation system generates all these complaints and why there are problems every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interaction between road users.
The problem is that it is very difficult to study traffic flow because driving habits cannot be 100% predicted.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to be reasonably consistent, so traffic flow tends to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
For a more complete representation of traffic flow, we define the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of having their wings folded along their body.
This gives them more places to crawl into to avoid predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are ants and termites.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view; they think that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching up to six miles wide.
As much as 20% of the world's rivers flowing into the ocean come from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and engineering excellence of the Giza pyramids are unmatched.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the historical remains left by their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest independent state and one of the most sparsely populated.
The Vatican's laws and official documents are written in Italian.
Italian is also the language spoken by most of the country's working population, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements of gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they exist in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle argued that all things are composed of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also speculates that they could turn into new matter to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as silicon and molybdenum are considered metals.
The alloy can also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, trillions of atoms small enough to fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was first introduced.
Unfortunately, the status and use of the pencil has declined with the rise of new forms of writing.
We write messages on computer screens now, and we don't need pencil sharpeners anymore.
We can only wonder where the keyboard is going to be until something new is invented.
Nuclear fission bombs work by fusing a large number of protons and neutrons into a single nucleus, which requires a lot of energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy trolley up a mountain.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they split easily with little or no thrust.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust.
The earth's crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar sea and thicker on the plateau.
There is a possibility that there are more lunar maria nearby due to the thinner crust.
The core of content theory is to find out what moves or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that they internalize as they grow into adulthood.
These theories explore what makes some people want certain things and what makes them want to do or not do certain things in their environment.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, when a manager starts to lead his former colleagues, there are two possible behaviors.
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, enforce discipline, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities and hold subordinates accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is a completely different person who thinks he or she has to change everything the team has been doing and do things his or her way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This often creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
The virtual team must adhere to the same quality standards as the traditional team, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for the physical team they are working with.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, and their teams may be meeting in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
In addition, the "invisible management team" (from Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a management team to which each member belongs directly, and which sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to build learning institutions through a time-consuming process?
Creativity and innovation flourish when all functional departments within an organization make effective use of all available resources.
Thus, the process of organizations working together to overcome barriers drives the process of innovation to meet the needs of customers.
Leaders need to create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning before organizations have the capacity to innovate.
The continuity model is a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide concrete evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research, thus narrowing the scope and making the study more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The invention of new technologies has allowed us to see and study the structure and functioning of the brain in a way we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build a simulation model that helps us understand the processes of our mind.
Despite its strong sci-fi connotations, AI forms an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
One of the goals of AI research is to build machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, answering customer diagnoses and questions, and recognizing handwriting, voices and faces.
It's a different discipline that focuses on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and are built into some home computers and video game software.
Teachers often want to take students to places where buses cannot go.
Technology offers virtual off-campus learning as a solution.Students can sit in classrooms and visit art museums, visit aquariums or admire beautiful art.
The virtual sharing of lessons outside the classroom is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design an annual website for their trip to the state capital, which is updated every year, but the old version remains online as a scrapbook.
Blogging also helps students improve their writing skills.Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, this can usually be changed because of the presence of readers.
Since students are usually the most selective readers, bloggers will start to work harder to avoid being criticized.
Writing a blog also "forces students to learn more about the world around them" (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond traditional school life.
The correct use of blogs "enhances students' ability to analyze and critique; students can clearly define where they stand in the context of other people's writing by actively responding to online material and articulating their own views on specific issues" (Olavés, 2002).
Ottawa, the capital of Canada, is a beautiful, bilingual city with many galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north are Muskoka and other areas of natural beauty that remain untapped.
These and many others are what make Ontario the quintessentially Canadian province it is seen to be by outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost smoke-free wilderness.
A demographic comparison that surprised many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar, the largest of the islands, is rich in wildlife, making it a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or have ties to France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which developed greatly in Guadeloupe and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
It connects the Sahel region in the north with the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: All female tourists are advised to identify themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring will also help (but don't wear it to look too expensive).
Women friends should also be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they see as harassment, such as being followed, being grabbed by the arm, etc.
When you say no to a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground (it's not right, cultural differences or not!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese razed the city and rebuilt it as "Casa Branca" (White House), only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and renamed it Dar El Badiya after the Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old part of the medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including Taj pots, pottery, leather goods, incense and all kinds of floral decorations, but these are sold to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, next to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is still safe, it is important to do your homework before traveling outside of Goma to learn about the ongoing war in North Kivu.
The city is also home to Mount Nyiragongo, where some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa can be done.
You can get around Goma using Boda-boda (motorcycle taxis), a short ride usually costs about 500 Congolese francs.
Timbuktu has become a symbol of a faraway exoticism because it is relatively difficult to access.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its past fame has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert dust.
This is one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the World in Africa.
The city is markedly different from the rest of the country, as it prefers to have an Arab rather than an African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Salmon River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,000 square kilometers, divided into 14 ecological zones, and is home to a diverse array of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park is maintained on a daily basis and there is an entrance fee.
Perhaps it would be cheaper to buy a Wild Card ticket, which gives you access to some of South Africa's selected parks, or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and a major tourist attraction for many travelers.
Some say that the whole row of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline resembles a long, shimmering line of light under the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and head to Kowloon Beach on the other side of the island.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated in the newly developed northern coastal city of Haiphong.
The British colonialists claimed the area as their own, so it's a good place to start if you want to find evidence of colonial history in the land.
The Sunderbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coastline into Bangladesh and the Indian mainland.
The Pandabans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, located in an area of India known as the Pandabans National Park.
The forest is not only mangrove swamp, but also contains a part of the giant jungle that once covered the Henghe Plain and is now all that remains.
The forests cover an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about a third of which is water or swamp.
Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is currently home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Pygmies.
Buses depart from the regional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most buses leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those going to the east and Shankar/Bumthang.
It is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance because the buses are often full.
Most of the area can be reached by comfortable and sturdy Japan Coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 NIS) and Punakha (200 NIS).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oiapoque River, connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges-d'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high and 378 meters long, with two lanes of 3.5 meters each.
The project was completed in August 2011 but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully open to traffic in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní, the most important indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guacurú and the Payagua, who make their living from hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay (previously known as the "giant province of India") was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a three-century-long colonial period.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the local identity and character.
Argentina is known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in Las Cañitas in December.
There are also other smaller championships or competitions held at other times of the year.
For more information about the tournament and to purchase tickets, please contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands is in Stanley, opposite the Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Shop, the only place where money can be changed.
Pound Sterling is widely accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
Payment methods may be available in UK and US dollars, but credit cards should not be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange its currency outside the Falkland Islands, so be sure to do so before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region where summer temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius.
The cold winters can sometimes be deceiving, as the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no specific "rainy season" or "dry season" and rainfall is roughly evenly distributed throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, reindeer, elk, bears and almost all large animals are aggressive.
The animals are large, untamed and potentially dangerous, so please give them enough space.
Also, be aware that the smell attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa.The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the site of the infamous naval blockade when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave.
Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives in the sinking.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the main chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed during a peaceful gathering in the town.
Auckland straddles two harbours and therefore has many beaches.
Located on the Pacific coast, North Shore Beach (North Harbour) stretches from Long Bay in the north to Port Devon in the south.
The beaches are almost all safe for swimming and most of them have the shade provided by New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Avenue Beach is located in the Waitematā Harbour, in the central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with rows of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is "First", which is not a complex beer, but a smooth and refreshing beer.
Although there are also many French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines may be more affordable to ship long distances.
The local tap water is safe and drinkable, but bottled water is easily available if you are unsure.
For Australians, "white coffee" is an exotic idea. Concentrated coffee is espresso, cappuccino is coffee with a high concentration of cream (not foam) and tea without milk.
The quality of the hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef all year round, and few people get injured.
Tourists are still advised to follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, box jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries north of 1770.Outside of these times, they are occasionally spotted.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans.
The bay's turtles are not active in the ocean and their main habitat is the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually work with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through travel agencies, such as campsites.
Package tours offered by travel agencies often include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotels.
If you need time to think about the proposal or gather additional documents for your destination, such as a visa, they can also hold the booking for you.
However, if you encounter any problems that need to be improved or if you have any requests, you should contact the travel agency first, not the hotel directly.
In some festivals, most of the visitors to the music festival choose to camp at the festival site, and most of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to see the event up close, you'll have to get there early and find a campsite close to the music.
Don't forget that even if the main stage has ended, the concerts in other parts of the festival may continue until late at night.
Some festival venues have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, make sure you know where your stove is, because in the stove most affected by the ice floes, it makes a terrible noise.
The cruise includes sightseeing of the city.Visas are not required for passengers on the ship (check regulations).
Casinos often go to great lengths to keep guests staying longer and spending more.
They usually offer special meals, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
Some places will offer free alcoholic drinks. However, getting drunk reduces judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who has to drive at high altitude or on mountain roads should consider how likely they are to encounter snow, ice or temperatures below freezing.
You can't drive on ice and snow like you can on a normal asphalt road.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make you unable to move.
Snow or heavy snowfall, condensation or ice on the windows can reduce visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow are common, and traffic is almost unimpeded all year round.
Hunting is arguably one of the most attractive elements of tourism in Africa and a highlight of many visitors' trips.
The word "safari" is commonly used to refer to a land-based trip to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially the savannah flora and fauna.
Elephants and giraffes are animals that tend to be close to the car, so the standard equipment will give you a better view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes afraid of humans and are best viewed with binoculars.
Jungle treks (also known as jungle walks, wildlife hikes or treks) involve hiking and can last from a few hours to several days.
The festival will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Several of the projects will be carried out in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the last being in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most of the cancellation policies imposed after the end of March due to the novel coronavirus were not extended to July 2020, the original date of the Olympics.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, compared to ¥7,000 for general admission.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed even if they are not provided in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing socks, you can try using a blower to dry your socks, if you have one.
It's important not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
Among the many ways to purify water, some are more effective in dealing with specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you have any doubts, buy sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
Visitors may encounter animal pests that are uncommon in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that try to hurt or kill people, are usually not pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain areas.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on beer, wine and other goods.
The route between Bournemouth and Fairmont passes through some of the most remote and rugged terrain in Buffalo, the toughest section of Pittsburgh's freeway.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp bends are the majority.
The announcement of the speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and next sections, generally 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict adherence to these speed limits is even more important than other sections.
It is interesting to note, however, that the mobile phone service is much better here than in other places along the route, such as the Penn State Wilderness.
Germany's pastries are delicious, and Bavaria's pastries are rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apples are made into pastries all year round, and cherries and plums are on the table in the summer.
Almonds, apples and other tree nuts are common ingredients in many German baked goods, and popular pastries are often especially good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small and filling snack, you can try a deep-fried fruitcake called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetable dishes.
Curry is classified as either "dry" or "sour" depending on the liquid content.
Yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes in Pakistan and inland North India, while coconut milk is commonly used in other coastal regions of South India and the Indian subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes from the country's more than 17,000 islands.
The term Javanese cuisine is derived from the Javanese language, but when used without any other modifier, it usually refers to the food originating from central and eastern Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine, which can be found throughout Indonesia, is based on a variety of dishes that are simply seasoned, with the most common ingredients being peanuts, salt, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various spices.
The saddle is used to support the rider's legs, which are suspended on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but the rider's feet can get stuck, so there are safety concerns.
If a rider falls off his horse, but there is a peg in the saddle, he may be dragged away while the horse is running.
First of all, most of the riders wear narrow boots with heels and smooth soles.
In addition, some saddles (especially English saddles) have safety handles that allow the rider to pull back the saddle belt when falling.
The valley of Cochamo, Chile's premier rock climbing site, known as the winner of South America's beauty pageant, boasts a wide variety of granite walls and cliffs.
At the top of the mountain there is a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world continue to break new routes on the potentially endless walls.
Mountain skiing, which includes snowboarding and snowmobiling, is a popular sport that involves attaching a snowboard or snowboard to your feet and sliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a popular tourist activity for many people, sometimes referred to as ski enthusiasts, who plan their entire vacation around skiing and staying in a specific location.
The concept of skiing has been around for a long time, with cave paintings depicting skiers as far back as 5000 BC.
The sport of alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club in Australia was founded by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking: This activity is also known as ski mountaineering, ski tourism or ski mountaineering.
This activity is similar to alpine skiing, but does not usually involve alpine skiing and mountaineering, which are done on steep terrain and require more robust skis and snowshoes.
It's a good idea to think of a ski trail as a similar kind of hiking trail.
When the conditions are good, the distance covered by the snow will be slightly longer than walking, but you rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without re-equipment on an empty snow track.
Despite its relatively small size, Europe is a continent of many independent countries. In general, traveling between several countries means having to apply for several visas and go through several passport checks.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area operates like a country.
In general, you can enter and exit the country without having to go through passport control again as long as you stay in this area.
Similarly, as a Schengen visa holder, you save time, money and paperwork by not having to apply for a visa for each Schengen country.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique.Some tax authorities define objects that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
There are different definitions in different geographical regions, and in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Although handcrafted items have existed for a shorter time than other mass-produced goods of the same type, they may be considered antiques.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, but it is also an important part of the culture surrounding reindeer herding for many Sami people in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather in fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer as beasts of burden.
Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami people.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often perceived as hateful due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advisory restrictions, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
In addition to your own inquiries, you may also want to consult the government, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may be treated differently than Europeans or Arabs.
The consultation is only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
They often provide a crude, clichéd and oversimplified viewpoint compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the collective term for all dangerous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain or snow, and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Tourists are strongly advised to pay attention to the possibility of bad weather affecting the area they are visiting, as bad weather may affect tourism plans.
If someone is planning to travel to countries that are considered war zones, they should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "hostile environment course" will probably lead to the address of a local company.
The course usually explains all the issues discussed here in a more detailed way, often with the help of practical experience.
The course typically lasts two to five days and involves role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should carry valid travel documents.
Governments are not necessarily willing to issue passports without an X or to renew documents for people who wish to have a specific name and gender.
There is a wide variation in the degree to which governments are willing to recognize these documents.
After September 11, 2001, the security checkpoints became tougher.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to be able to go through the scanner without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Offshore currents are waves that break off and return after hitting a beach, usually near a reef or similar place.
Depending on the underwater topography, the return waves will be concentrated in a few deeper areas, where they may generate fast currents flowing towards the deep water.
Most of the deaths occurred while trying to swim against the current, which can have a very low success rate.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim to a place where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your swimming skills and whether or not anyone has noticed, wait for rescue.
Adverse culture shock occurs faster, lasts longer, and is more severe than culture shock.
For travelers who are quick to adapt to a new culture, it can sometimes be especially difficult to readjust and integrate into their native culture.
After living abroad for some time, you have adapted to the new culture and you have forgotten some of the habits that you acquired in your home country.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, most people will treat you with patience and understanding, knowing that it takes time to adjust to a new country.
But when it comes to the returnees, people may not feel the need to care and understand them anymore.

Finland, known as the Land of a Thousand Lakes, is also home to thousands of islands in lakes or islets off the coast.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, small boats and even kayaks offer a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
In the Netherlands, for example, the number is 1 in 40.)
Most Baltic cruise ships have a stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In other words, you can spend days visiting the historic city and return to the boat at night to spend the night.
You don't need an additional visa if you are going ashore on a boat tour (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not on the sea, so the cost of visiting the city is not included in the price of the mailboat.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for anyone, regardless of age or background, especially for those who have never flown or have experienced trauma.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different than many people being afraid or disgusted by something in particular.

Time is often of the essence when transporting business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The bigger airlines have their own planes on some routes, but other routes or smaller airlines have more problems.

The most straightforward way to get on a first or business class flight is to pay a hefty amount of money for the privilege (and even better, let the company pay).
However, it's not cheap: roughly speaking, you'll need to pay about four times more for business class and eleven times more for first class than for regular flights!
In general, on direct flights from Phnom Penh to Hanoi, trying to find deals on business or first class seats is futile.
There is a segment of the airline market in Shenzhen that is willing to pay high prices to reach its core customer base quickly and comfortably.
The capital of the Republic of Moldova is Chisinau. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

Today, pre-modern observatories are often obsolete and continue to be used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as severe during the heyday of the pre-modern observatories, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
