This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot usually be provided by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to the scientists, the animal had chestnut-brown feathers on its upper body and light-colored or carotenoid feathers on its underside.
This discovery also gives us an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed central shaft called the rachis but shared other features, such as spines and barbels, with modern feather structures, researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather to regulate temperature or for display. Researchers believe that the example shows an adult feather, not a bird feather, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
The researchers felt that although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather and not a small bird feather.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning in the police district of Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

They discovered that the Sun's operation is based on the same basic principles as other stars. The results showed that the activity in all the stars of the system was guided by their luminosity and rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rossby number which relates to the plasma flow.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in reversing the polarity of its magnetic field.

The work performed was mostly theoretical although the program was designed to simulate observations performed on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a halo shape and consists of many small particles.

The government has also pledged several million vials of anti-encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.
Plans to distribute vaccines to historically hard-hit areas were delayed this year because of a lack of funding and because they were given less priority than other diseases.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters self-isolate in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope designating the candidate of their choice.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law strictly defines the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes in them before voting begins and that no envelopes are added other than those of properly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness any part of the process. The votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict control, following the relevant procedures.

However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused of murdering her son in the Edinburgh Magistrates Court.
She is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be corrupted because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice throughout the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be treading on dangerous ground if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all criminal prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is announced.
According to reports, the document will refer to opposition to borders, which Palestine wants according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
It is thought that other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem that is holy to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, pending the signing of this agreement, seeks to have a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The shooters had to be closely supervised by guards during the additional pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director for Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extended instructions on their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council for Martel in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing six fires in total and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been made aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that Apple had informed it of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no injuries had been reported at the site.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released first, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed the maturation of fetal lungs in babies.
Xinhua reported that state investigators found two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by his fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Rare enough, like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that: "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, opponents of Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, stating that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his fitness has not been assured.
He has not been able to take the proper medication to overcome his pain, as they are banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how the Earth was formed by the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political dogma and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be provided and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking facilities, as well as parking and travel, are not available to the playing fields.
The fear of lack of transportation increased the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to take longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's ground squirrel, Geospiza fortes, and the incoming cactus ground squirrel, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can then be twisted and woven; it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be thinned so much that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is evidenced by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H of pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of an electron and a proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet, clean hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel weird and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every dwelling, connected by an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets, in Roman civilization, were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has brought us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier mode of transportation.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger-than-average cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
As a result, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat many more small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the comfort zone, a special function of each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, are generally closer to one another.
Prides of lions behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals with behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
Like a well-trained athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in a group with lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roam.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but it is more like a sentence with words and cries.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by using the wind to sniff out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily as well.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a range or river, or if they go to a new island that they cannot easily return to), they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously needed competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale by breathing).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of its era, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, meaning that nothing in its path escaped.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a tongue like a fork, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat it.
Although we would be familiar with most of their foods, the Romans had many strange or unusual items for the feast, including wild boar, palloin, snails, and a type of rodent called a ger.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, wealthy men liked to eat together at banquets, where they ate their meals lying on their backs.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have included foods that came from the Americas or Asia to Europe during later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted seafood.
The Babylonians built a central temple, called a god's house, for each of their gods.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to care for the gods' needs by holding festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
Housing was not of great importance in the hot climate of the Middle East.
Jewish family life centered on the outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open porches overlooking the street; stone was used to build dwellings.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, on his travels west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time despite his discovery.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of this document, written upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Hence, it is possible that the note was simply a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by the French under the Vichy regime, the French who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers rather than fight them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on 15 August 1940 and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive and shared culture of a fairly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis" meaning "civil", which is related to the Latin words "civis" meaning "citizen" and "civitas" meaning "city" or "city-state", which also determines the size of the society to some extent.
City-states are the precursors of states. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuing cultural imprint and an equitable spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first established a weak central government - with Congress as its only structure - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, since it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, for the enforcement of all its laws.
He also had no authority to violate the laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, were the champions of the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of Japan's island grouping, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins go back much further, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
The Dutch East India Company establishes in 1624 a base in Southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas to the west and north of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main buildings, namely: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of still photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today and above all, in the same format inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio with integers) is thus 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by maintaining a degree of order in an image.
He determines that the most effective location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound European nations together despite differences in language and custom.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church coffers are there specifically for that reason.
The principal organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was being applied.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to deny all shipping access to large parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was little response to this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing attitudes of most states and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a rare way of telling different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a known dynasty.
Also, between each of the dynasties there was a period of instability with separate provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, there was a fierce struggle between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, in which thousands died in the struggle for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were also opened to all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This also applies to the army because instead of army ranks being based on rank, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Nur" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find, even if you know it's there.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above you and the many mountains surrounding you. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper arch" mark looks like a V and the "lower arch" mark looks like a wire clamp or a square without the lower rib.
"Top" means that you have to start at the top and push the bow and "bottom" means that you have to start at the ring (which is where the hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more determined.
You can keep your notes, but remember that the printed arches are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of merchants.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenses of American imperialism's war to occupy the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds was traded on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super profits realized from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
One must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and succeeded by the Late Middle Ages, which by agreement ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the technological drive or necessity of technology to the narrow sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two main ideas in common: that the development of technology itself proceeds in a way beyond cultural or political influence and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are natural, socially unconditioned.
One might say, for example, that the automobile necessarily leads to better roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a small number of vehicles, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a pronounced element of cultural determinism, brought by such writers as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography brought people together and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and, as they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris stands out as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its position declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the native Byzantine culture.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own.
Existential farming is farming that is applied to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses local seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield increase.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and the situation continues to be the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by distinctive and symbolic use of style involving fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is based on some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accidents, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized with adults during their upbringing.
Some feral children are confined by humans (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' non-acceptance of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Feral children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma prior to abandonment or abandonment.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the feral child manifests behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the particular care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to people.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, Scaffolded Learning takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support tool for people undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real, I mean, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little man in the form of the Microsoft Office letter opener.
Virtual scaffolding is appropriated by software and is intended to investigate, prompt and explain procedures that the learner may have found difficult to handle on their own.
Children are sent to the children's home for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should, under any circumstances, grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and nurturing, but they are growing up that way.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system is supposed to provide loving caregivers, safe homes, safe health care and continuing education.
The conservatorship is supposed to provide them with all the necessities lacking in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and pleasures.
For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are proposed as important incentives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects related to motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in explaining microexpressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by accurately interpreting his facial expressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even thought that animals, such as domestic dogs, might have similar abilities to explain human behavior.
Twentieth-century studies have proved that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Separation and recombination mix the variation repeatedly between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to obtain amino acids from the vegetation of the savannah.
Also, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins derived from leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them unless they're cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide large amounts of protein that has all the necessary amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively low-volume alarm clock to bring you to your senses without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while sleeping, you may want to move it to the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking enough fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed to force one to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is in direct proportion to the level of tension in his body and mind.
As tension decreases, the current life force increases, and each individual has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but was further enriched by Mahayana "way of love" theological thought and more Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, through the visual representation of certain deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture led to the quarrel of the states.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would go on for the next 40 years and be fought, really, by authorized armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans fell out of use almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying regions of Eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to move large amounts of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while, at the same time, interfering with the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to move men and materiel across the Atlantic Ocean to come to the aid of Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop the traffic, using mainly submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often under the care of goatherds who were usually children or adolescents, much like the better-known shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the chariots consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of the day.
The sleepers were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place; however, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a sheet of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron wore out more than the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking on two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "standing man").
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk on foot.
Adaptations for walking on two legs have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can participate in the environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
In many cases, this is the same as treating the symptoms; however, we need to find the cause of the problem and eliminate it if we want only a temporary solution.
It is abundantly clear that the world has undergone tremendous changes because of mankind's advances in science and technology, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
Following its passage on July 4 by Congress, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap Leaflets were produced.
The first public reading of the document was made on July 8 by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios known to exist so far are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today think that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have clawed feet and scales, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to warrant an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the most obvious sign of poisoning.
Consult the label for special first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term canker in its formal sense.
The term derives from its long-standing resemblance to bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer insects and bedbugs are nimble, adapted to live in the nest or in the shelter of their hosts.
In the entire United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that rearing a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually drives most scientific research.
But it is not the only one; scientific study is also guided by experimentation, and experiment is evidence used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms related to physiology and behavior often depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been documented that are not simply responses to periodic external cues.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue a period of freewheeling cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the key proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can bring about a host of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells that are affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in cells from the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who have an interest in going to natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is the development of tours, photography and education about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the cities by car to go to their place of work and pass by other people whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth movement of transportation, everyone is somehow connected and supports a car-based transportation system.
Now science shows that a massive carbon-based economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everybody is a participant in society and everybody uses transportation systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear so many complaints about poor water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why are transportation systems causing these frustrations, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic movement is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and of interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a consistent time interval; therefore, traffic flows can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design, and use of road facilities.
Among animals, insects were the first to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them to avoid their predators more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back to their body length.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems logical, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on earth and the widest, carrying eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, six miles wide in some places.
Fully 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors that were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and in its official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of much of the civil service, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements since antiquity, such as gold, silver, and copper, since all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract from mines with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, air, water, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new matter to create whatever we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also make alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could dot the end of this sentence.
Thus, with his invention, the pencil became a good companion for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and uses of the pencil have declined.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever needing to use a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
The atom bomb works on the principle that the fusion of some protons and neutrons into a nucleus requires energy.
Like lifting a heavy cart up a hill, separating the core from the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to split spontaneously or with only the slightest provocation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the dark marshy areas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they keep inside as they grow into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes some people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two widespread theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can be observed when managers start managing their former colleagues.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unusual decisions, impose disciplinary measures, make performance reviews, assign tasks and responsibilities to everyone.
At the other end of the spectrum, one easily transforms into an outsider who thinks he or she has to change everything the team has done and own it.
After all, the leader holds ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior causes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and skill can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a process of reinvention to serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. As a result, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The interconnection between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain functions of the mind.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand our own mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has received strong nuances in science fiction literature, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves the creation of devices for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have morphed into distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into several software applications of personal computers and video games.
Field trips occupy a large part of any teaching methodology. It is not uncommon for a teacher to express a desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Virtual field trips are also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the capital, this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still stored online as a memory block.
While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger initiates efforts to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more savvy about the world around them". The need to feed the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
Using blogs appropriately "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online material, students can determine their own positions regarding writings by others, as well as determine their own views regarding particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital which has a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north harbors the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this, and much more, presents Ontario with elements that are considered by outsiders to be most typically Canadian.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost deserted.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the world's largest island and its wildest continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a profound influence on the islands of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you bring a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they consider harassment and stalking, arm-twisting etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (even if it's due to cultural differences, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia and it was called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of ornaments, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a resort city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Niragongo volcano that covered most of the city's streets and especially the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, you should research any visit outside Goma to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano along with some of the lowest cost mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motor taxis) to move around Goma. The usual price (locally) is approximately 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its ridiculous inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic faraway places.
Timbuktu is today a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the danger from desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Public Broadcasting Service special "Wonders of the African World".
The city has a strong contrast to the rest of the cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is called the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has daily fees for entry and maintenance.
You may also have the benefit of purchasing a "Wild Card", which offers entry to any of South Africa's selection of parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the destination of choice for many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a dazzling ribbon chart highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to Kowloon Wharf.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the land claimed by the British colonialists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal rhizosphere in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to the Bengal and Indian coastal belt.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian part is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just swamps of rhizomes; they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the northern Indian plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, roughly a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that 400 Royal Bengal tigers are now found in the area and some 30,000 deer have also been encountered.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling eastwards and to Jakarta/Bumthang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since intercity buses are often full.
Most prefectures are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking taxis together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-d'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two aisles 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction finished in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was formed as a result of the clash between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
It was the Spanish who began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, go to the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is set equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located on Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
Outside the islands, it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and temperatures over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than it is.
There is no particularly "wet" and "dry" season: the rainfall level is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
No matter how wise they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack you.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep their distance. These are wild, large, and possibly dangerous animals, and you should give them the space they need.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid storing or cooking odorous food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships sunk except one British cruiser, approximately 200 American and German lives lost.
During the attempts at independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful organization in the city brought about the assassination of the main Tupua Tamasese leader Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's stretch between two harbours.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Road are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the fashionable suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a row of shops lining the shore.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be easier to find.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are afraid.
To Australians, the idea of a "plain white" coffee is foreign - a short black is an espresso, the cappuccino is served covered with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Throughout the year, many trips are made on tires, and tire damage from any of these causes is rare.
But again, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770 Bay. Occasionally they may appear outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with individual hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, arranging transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp at the same location, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music may have ended on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your cabin, as the movement on the ice makes a terrible noise for those who are more sensitive.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers for food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and in their seats.
Some places provide free alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and you cannot steer as you would on smooth asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you are stranded.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or blizzard conditions or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many places, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's main tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to trips overland to view Africa's amazing wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, usually approach close to the vehicles, and with standard equipment, you will be able to get a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you may see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or "walking" hike) consists of several hours or ten days of walking.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a confusing situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, the bulk of coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of tickets to the event will be priced from 2,500 to 130,000 yen, with typical tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for rent, even if you do not have one in your room.
If you do not have an iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which could cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause skin irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, deliver poison, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases per se or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is a case of buying goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in some countries.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The segment of road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing isolated virgin forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep in mind that steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and full compliance with them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastas are very good, and in Bavaria they are as varied as those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastes are common, ranging from apple pies served year-round to plum pies served in summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what are called berliner, pfannkuchen, or krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "liquid", depending on the amount of liquid.
Yogurt is generally used in curry in the interior regions of North India and Pakistan; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But the term is intended to mean foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java if used without other qualifiers.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, has a range of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant flavorings favored by Javanese being: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and several aromatic spices.
The stirrups are footrests for the rider that hang down either side of the saddle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but they can be a safety concern because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged back if the horse moves away.
First, most riders wear boots with flat, very narrow soles and heels.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that allow the girth to fall off the saddle if pulled back by the falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
Mountaineers from every corner of the world are constantly trying out new routes between its endlessly possible faces.
Hill-country snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a widespread travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski nomads", whose sole purpose in vacationing is to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is incredibly old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first ski-training club.
Backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski touring.
It is related to but does not usually include alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, where the latter are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a skiing itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot, but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on cleared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, travel to many countries would require numerous visa applications and passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a country in this respect.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you no longer need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in countries such as North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be called antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture around the trade is also important for many people with other professions.
Although traditionally the Sami have not all been involved on a large scale in reindeer herding, they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern crafts.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is usually considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel advisory is issued for your destination, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but they are programmed for their own citizens.
To give an example, U.S. citizens may encounter different circumstances in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory notices are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic in comparison with the more detailed information given elsewhere.
'Severe weather' is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon which is likely to cause damage, serious disruption of social life or loss of human life.
Severe weather can be encountered anywhere in the world and there are different types of severe weather that can be conditioned by geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Forms and effects of severe weather include strong winds, thunderstorms, heavy rainfall, and fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Severe atmospheric conditions of regional and seasonal weather include blizzards, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any danger from severe weather affecting their area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be called a war zone needs professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environments course" may turn up the address of a local society.
A course will normally address in much greater detail all the issues discussed here, generally with practical experience.
A course will be regularly from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of training for first aid and sometimes weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning a sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender declaration (X) or updated documents matching the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies greatly.
After September 11, 2001, checkpoints have become much more intrusive.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through scans without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return currents of waves leaving the shore, often in a tire or similar.
Underwater topology causes the gyre to concentrate in some deeper parts and there a fast current can be formed towards the seabed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, it might be best to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs faster than culture shock (it has a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adjusted well to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you will have adjusted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs from your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's light and sound show is one of the area's most popular attractions for children.
Before the show starts, you can see the pyramids in silence and darkness.
Usually you always hear the voices of tourists and vendors.
The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Images appear on the pyramids and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Vila-Las-Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano provides an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula unite here on the plateau and then emerge again to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In isolated places without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only choice.
Satellite phones can't generally replace cell phones, because you have to be outdoors with an unobstructed line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice calls.
Your local telephone service provider can provide additional information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a sabbatical is travel and education.
This is particularly preferred by school leavers, allowing them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of entering higher education when you return home.
Generally, to enroll in these educational programs, a tuition fee will be required.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in these lakes and archipelagos.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, apart from them, is something quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most special Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days while returning to spend the night on the boat.
If you go ashore only on boat excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises in their brochures feature the German city of Berlin. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea so a visit to this city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes of many, many other people.
For some, a little knowledge of how airplanes work and what happens on a flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important for work documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some lines, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but it was a problem for other lines and smaller companies.
If the items were sent by air, some routes could take days to clear customs.
The only way to get them through faster would be as checked baggage, and airline regulations prohibit unattended baggage, and that's where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first or business class is to collect a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have the company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a rough general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times more for first class!
It is usually not even worth asking for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there are a handful of passengers who are willing to pay high prices for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religious faith in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second-largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now become a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center, situated on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches are interspersed among wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, though the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik affords views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has a quaint octagonal church.
On the tombs of the churchyard, there are some interesting sculptures, in the form of doves, made in marble.
It is well worth the half-hour stroll through the intriguing countryside.
To the north and nearby is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, made famous to outsiders by Lord Byron's vivid account of its beauty.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also, head north to the splendid Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a site of mass graves, as well as a site of almost unparalleled significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the times that passed here and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death here, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Show the dignity, solemnity and respect that this object deserves.
Do not damage the appearance of the object by making notes or graffiti on these structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, the vast majority of signs are marked only in Catalan, because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Common announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but for unscheduled disruptions announcements are made by an automated system in a multitude of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, harsh, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave well, to act like someone who is "bien élevé".
The rugged Parisian exterior will soon soften if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is covered with dense forests, mainly of beech, pine and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a particularly large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, dissimilar soils and different elevation levels.
The region is also the habitat of a huge number of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife can be found there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and wild rooster, along with many more common species.
When entering a monastery, women must wear skirts below the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the spare pants at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each wearer, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these baggy pants.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil exclusively.
A simple dinner typical of the area, especially during the summer, is "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever other ingredients are available such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns next to the word Sie, meaning "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from adverbs.
It also makes reading obviously easier, although the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to detect whether a verb or pronoun has been used in a substantiated form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch for are c and g, as their pronunciation changes with the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r's and r's differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means chariot.
Persian has a fairly simple and generally regular grammar.
Hence, if you read this practical grammar, you will be able to learn much about Persian grammar and better understand its expressions.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a limited knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is too similar and therefore need not be studied independently.
Medieval observatories have largely outlived their usefulness and are now museums and educational centers.
Since light pollution in their day was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses that are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern survey telescopes are very large objects in special areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing known as hanami has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The notion came from China where the favorite flower was the plum.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look much better in their natural habitat, so do not be tempted to remove them as a "lone" specimen.
If you visit a regulated garden, even collecting "samples" will get you kicked out.
Singapore is generally a remarkably safe place and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But since it is located in the "northern tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with either heat (always) or strong sun (less often, when the sky is clear).
Several buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes within Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to provide the basis for holidays around them.
For example, by visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or by cruising to interesting places on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also designate routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many Christmas traditions have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in an open area to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into festivities as soon as midnight strikes to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or wading.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals followed, including horses, cows, goats, cats, dogs, and mice.
If you visit Antarctica or the Arctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to view polar dawns, as the sky will be dark most of the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, visual pollution is easy and usually not a problem, so you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address one another by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group efforts rather than lauding individual achievements.
Often, employees must obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
