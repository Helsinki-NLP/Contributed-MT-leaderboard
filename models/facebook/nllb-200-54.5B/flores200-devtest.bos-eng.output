This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a well-established theory, but it allows for details that fossils usually can't provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top, with a pale or yellow-orange-red underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed crest, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - spines and tiny quills - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably part of a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance.
Research has shown that even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern shows adult feathers and not chick feathers.
A car bomb detonated yesterday at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and wounded more than two dozen others.

The luminosity and rotation together are used to determine the star's Rosby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is due to magnetic field inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and consists of many small particles.

Voting in France is conducted without technology, with voters isolating themselves in a booth and placing a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope marked with the candidate they are voting for.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes of properly counted and authorized voters are put into the box.
Candidates can send representatives to oversee every part of the process, and at night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts have considered it possible that publishing the photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists do seem to walk a fine line in publishing photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is fully in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are laid.
The document will, according to leaked information, relate to a dispute over borders that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly include a future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA accepts a military presence of only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control pilot program were to be under the watchful eye of a ranger, as the pilot program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and park heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were given detailed instructions on safety and training.
Yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) nine members were sworn in before Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
At times violent protests have erupted over the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having information on 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company said was "not serious".
The DOJ responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (Friday at 09:19 pm GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports no damage has been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no tsunami indicators.
A former Philippine police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, the elderly and photographers from the Philippines.
Photographers later took the old lady's place when she needed to use the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began work at the State Hospital for Women in Auckland.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he spent his spare time researching preterm labor.
His research has shown that administering hormones will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first queen of extremity. My first manager. Luna passed away the night she was two months old. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented "Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even weirder...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic following the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The poll revealed two kinds of extreme views: 29 percent of those polled felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent felt that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following an appeal.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because pain medication is banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source for bringing water to Earth along with the organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There's speculation he'll run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter routes and thereby save millions of gallons of fuel annually while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be involved and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and bus shelters are not available near the stadium.
The fear of a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science made claims of the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into different shapes, it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and entangled, it can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then roll them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and creating a kind of protection.
At Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of mining towns in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in mixed company.
When you call someone who's miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call, then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of our light and our view.
To put a satellite or telescope in space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most important thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special skill that every cat possesses and for which they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats and live in large groups called packs.
The pride consists of one to three adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other because it's a big family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and also very deadly to their prey.
Like a true all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a string of angry shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey based on scent by sniffing the ground where the animals have been.
They see very well in the dark because of their night vision, and they move very quietly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, while crossing a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the environment they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptation than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need adjustments like before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to a new environment, it starts to look less and less like another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce food by photosynthesis using the sun.
We use plants to build our houses and make our clothes, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, afraid of nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for any creature in its path.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a forked tongue, and her diet may have included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and she may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also feasted on some strange or unusual foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a puh
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their deities, the Babylonians built a central temple that was viewed as the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open cash registers facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was initially rolled up and placed in an archive.
So it's possible that the note was added simply as a marker.
The Normandy landings (D-Day) and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
Northern France was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil and refers to the Latin word civis, which means citizen and civitas, which means city or city-state and which in some way defines the size of the society.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
Under the Articles of Confederation, during the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government whose only component was Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on often uncooperative state agencies to enforce its acts.
He also had no authority to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the full consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a change in aboriginal grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Picchu - the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film period.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the display format is taken from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually somewhat confusing - 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) equal or approximate this scale of proportions.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is stated that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, found itself in control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite their different languages and customs.
Its dominating force affected everyone - from kings to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for that very purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated internationally accepted law that had been codified in several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering parts of the ocean, causing danger even to ships of neutral nations.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted undersea warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were eager to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time, each stage in Chinese history or each dynasty that ruled was a recognizable dynasty.
Also, the period between each dynasty was a period of divided provinces. The most famous such period was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought among the many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution the professions were opened to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, because instead of military ranks being ranked by class, they're now ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life and often spent time in the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (Light) and meditated.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave, located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if one knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except a clear, beautiful sky and numerous mountains, very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still in existence today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains a series of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upstroke" designation looks like a V, and the "downstroke" designation looks like a connector or a square missing its bottom.
Up means you have to start from the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is louder and more declarative.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the printed string markings are provided for the purpose of the music, and should be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a Mafia member waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the cost and interest on the bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines would represent the ultimate profit of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is usually referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally dated to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic related to the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely outside the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically viable for just a few cars, which is why new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new techniques in medicine to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures associated with those geographical areas emerged and they, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renowned epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more highly prized than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style of dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages began to develop its own style. One of the great developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was when people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming which aims to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seed from a particular ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be recognizable by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through a specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their development due to neglect, accident or deliberate abuse.
Some feral children have been confined (usually by their parents); in some cases, children have been abandoned because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some are thought to have lived independently in the wild.
After being raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble the behavior of the animal that took care of it, such as fear and indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is one form of help but also the little man is a stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are intended to examine, instruct and explain procedures that might be challenging for a student to perform independently.
Children enter the foster care system for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where care, tenderness and education are not expressed, but they are.
We feel that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to meet all the needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access benefits and needs satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"When exploring audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new aspects of motivation".
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions one can detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, Presidential Speech, suggested that people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly evaluate honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century pointed to the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from a group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations between those two bases in each generation.
For a primate with a human-like digestive system, the savannah can be difficult to meet amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and beans, but those are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide an abundance of protein containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking during a normal sleep period and returning to sleep somewhat later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will force the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present, each person has the potential to find their absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, and through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and an awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had now become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses were already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were practically obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and large numbers of people across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to make sure that a country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while also disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean in order to provide aid to Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were most often kept in herds that roamed the hillsides or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goatherds, usually children or adolescents, similar to today's shepherd.
Wagons were manufactured in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to haul more cargo than was possible on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
Railway sleepers were introduced fairly early to fix rails, but it was gradually realised that rails would be much more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, were not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been observed in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even be activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This looks like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and extravagant life-styles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 were made that night, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and he read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and exists today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but the symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and common bed bugs are crimson, adapted for life in the nest or living quarters of their host.
There are about 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide it's not in their best interest, or their child's best interest, to raise a baby.
These couples can decide to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine the way the world works through the scientific method.
However, not only does experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in a wide range of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep ticking even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or they labeled the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the particular piece of genetic material, and whether the germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns on the outskirts and go to their jobs, passing those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive of a transportation system that's based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about poor water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems provoke such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently, so traffic has a kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, links have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was correct, but most believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth move, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors that were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and least populous country.
Vatican City uses the Italian language for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of the country's employees, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be mined relatively easily using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made from a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer ways of writing, the pencil has fallen into a lower status and is used less and less.
People type messages on computers now and never have to get a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more marl on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what causes people to behave in a certain way or attract them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have outgrown during maturation into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of pleasure are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can occur when managers begin to manage their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who ultimately bears responsibility for both the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in a disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The Invisible Team is a management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organization's process of collaborating to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Advances in new technologies allow us to see and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction context, it is an extremely important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence (AI) involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to provide answers to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things became separate disciplines that focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into several home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual field trips, where students can look at artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
The virtual trip is also a great way to look back on the trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and that website changes every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most criticized audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to upgrade the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to start thinking more analytically and critically. By actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lie Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas farther north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, which became particularly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It may also help if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, hold their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (regardless of cultural differences, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Bajja, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of geomags, but it's all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated when lava from Nyiragongo volcano flooded many of its streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
This town is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with one of the cheapest mountain gorilla climbs in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
Because of the fact that it was quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, faraway land.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is regarded as a leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily fees for protection and entrance.
It may be useful to purchase a Wildlife Card that can enter some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider a highlight of a visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the outline of Hong Kong are linked by a shimmering graph made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon Port on the other side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely settled on land reclaimed along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, you can start here.
The Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Yet, the forests are not just salt marshes - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which almost one-third of the area is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and close to 30,000 caribou now live in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
A shared taxi ride is a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, are 378 meters long and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous people in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and midfield players in the world.
In December, the polo fields of Las Cañitas host the biggest tournament of the year.
Small tournaments and games can be watched here at any time of the year.
For tournament news and places to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British currency and United States currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners for an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to encounters with humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Although they may look like docile animals, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peace rally in the town ended with the assassination of the paramount chief Tupou Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is bordered by two harbours.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, a suburb of the upper Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good assortment of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is "Number 1", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines you can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're scared, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "plain white" coffee is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is topped with plenty of cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
There are year-round trips to the reef, and reef injuries are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of the town of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean all the time, their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have accommodations once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may see that it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer or take out other documents needed to travel to that destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to secure a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the musical content on the main stages has been completed, there may be some parts of the festival where music will be played late into the night.
At some festivals there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin as the passage through the ice causes terrible noise for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money and time spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the facilities.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads the friction is low and it is not possible to drive as on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall very quickly to trap you.
Visibility may be limited by falling snow or hail or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal occurrences in many countries, and traffic continues largely unimpeded throughout the year.
A safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the amazing African wilderness, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and standard equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as a "bush walk", "safari hike", or "hiking") consists of a hike of several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some sporting events being held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can speed up drying, and many hotels will lend you an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not in your room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective than others depending on the specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're worried, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they have not seen at home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or at worst an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases alone, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as the road often passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cell phone reception is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made by their southern neighbours, the Austrians.
Fruit pastries are common - apples are baked in the dough year-round, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional gastronomy that is present throughout the nation.
But, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually denotes food originally native to the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now available throughout the archipelago, contains a range of simply spiced dishes.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot remains in the stirrup, the horse may pull him back if he tries to run away.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety levers that allow the leather straps to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls on them in a fall.
In the Cochamó Valley - a premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America - there are a variety of large granite walls and fissures.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes through its endless potential walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain on skis or boards attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity of many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski freaks", who plan entire vacations in terms of skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski-touring, or ski-walking.
It is related to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them, with the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a trail that's similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover longer distances than by walking, but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through the visa process and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen zone in this respect, acts as one country.
As long as you're in this zone, you can cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important Sami livelihood, and the culture around trade is also important to many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and reindeer were raised mainly as draft animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area where the Sámi live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani populations, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are going to visit becomes the subject of a travel warning, this may affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.
You can consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their own citizens.
One example is the fact that American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Councils are only a summary of the political situation in a particular country.
The views expressed are often brief, general, and simplified when compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Weather disasters can occur anywhere in the world. Disasters can be of different types, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Thunderstorms, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of any risk to their area from the storm as weather disturbances may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should have professional training.
If you do an Internet search for "hostile environment course", you'll probably find the address of a local firm.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in far greater detail, often with hands-on experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with the subject of war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
There is an uneven willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify a gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to act in accordance with these documents also varies widely.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who haven't had surgery yet shouldn't expect to go through the scanner and keep their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the backwash of waves hitting a shore, often a reef or something like that.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and there can be a fast current to the deep water.
Most deaths occur from fatigue that occurs when a swimmer tries to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you break free of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes before culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers needed to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that both patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light effects of the pyramids are some of the most interesting things in the children's section.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the quiet before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors.

The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, as many as sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is an area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into a plateau and then rise again into the 220-mile-long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, called Vinson Massif, whose summit called Mount Vinson is 4892 m high.
In remote areas with no cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone because you have to make calls outdoors, with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in the transport of cargo by ship, including recreational craft, as well as in expeditions that have the need to exchange data and voice messages remotely.
Your local telephone service provider should provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
It's an increasingly popular option for those planning a year of travel and study.
This is very popular with high school seniors, because it allows them to take a gap year before college without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of transferring to higher education in your home country.
Usually, tuition is charged to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. 'The land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands on the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht on an archipelago or a lake.
While the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The activity is almost the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is between one and forty).
Most of the various Baltic Sea cruises involve an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, then return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore as part of a boat trip, you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.

Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help some to overcome fear based on the unknown and a lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Time is often of the essence for business documents, goods or spare parts needed for emergency repairs.
For some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they're shipping by air, some routes can take several days to clear customs.
The only way to get the fry through was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to ditch the purse and shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular price for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to ask for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is used in many places.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
That conflict resulted in the establishment in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has a government and currency but has not been recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The most widespread religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with close to 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.

Please treat this place with the dignity, formality and respect it deserves.
Don't desecrate the site by making or carving graffiti on buildings.
In Barcelona, Catalan and Spanish are official languages. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan since it is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are announced by an automatic system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The sudden appearance of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is located in large forests, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and boasts a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the range of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude, it has a very wide variety of plant communities.

There you can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and tetra, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees and must cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries give scarves to women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you'll get a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants below the knee.
And you can borrow these at the door, but these clothes aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these sweaters.
Majorcan cuisine, like cuisines from similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), all using olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli - bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all available spices and toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for "you", are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.

Since light pollution at their peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes image huge objects in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the barberry was the flower of choice.
The emperor held the first behara cherry parties in Japan just for himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural setting, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.

There's a tradition that on Easter night, you don't sleep and you stand in an open area and watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, and parishioners begin celebrating at exactly midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of its great distance from the mainland, mammals have been unable to reach the islands, making the giant tortoise the Galapagos' main herbivore.
Since man came to Galapagos, many mammals have arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
