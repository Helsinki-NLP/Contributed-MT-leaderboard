Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but it provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown at the top and light or carotenoid-coloured at the bottom.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers deduced that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the thin, soft feathers of juveniles.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not juvenile hair.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than two dozen others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as regular matter does.
This theory says that the majority of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of diadem and is made of many small particles.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behaviour is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) AstroGeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters' names.
French electoral law codifies the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly authorised and counted voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process.In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her son.
She remains in custody pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be influenced by the widely published photograph of her.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be putting themselves at risk if they publish photos etc. of suspicious persons".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least before the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Shooters in the supplementary test for pest control had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating damaged iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed about the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino former policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later posed as an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in his spare time.
His research has shown that administering a hormone accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' which are the flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Truly one of a kind. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as unusual as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and miss her...hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believes Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 per cent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games relays, but his complaints raised questions about his fitness.
He could not take the necessary medicines for his pain as they are forbidden by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of delivery of water to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the chanting as "slogans and political stupidity".
It is speculated that he will present a presidential candidacy in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
The Commission considers that, in the light of the foregoing, there is no need to assess the compatibility of the aid with the internal market under Article 107 (3) (c) TFEU.
Fears of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal 'Science' provided a report on the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's sponge, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small molds.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can then be twisted and braided.
It could be made very thin, and attached to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Roll the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, crush them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women met together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends some of the light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet long to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways.The greatest thing the bicycle has done for us is to give us easier and faster transport.
He brought with him the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special task that each cat has and which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, plus a maximum of thirty females and offspring.
Women, in general, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and are also very deadly to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger can trot (though not very well), swim, leap great distances and pull five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of awkwardly uttered words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, holding the soil in place.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move stealthily, too.Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily move back) it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe in, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its day, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth, as well as another set of fangs on the roof of her mouth, which meant that anyone who got in her way had no chance of escape.
Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, peacocks, baboons, and a type of mouse-like rodent that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have a communal meal where they reclined on their sides while eating their food.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods that was viewed as the house of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and, behind it, an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so timber was expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the South of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and to some extent also defines the size of a society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations.Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural imprint and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as proper civilisations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they did not cooperate.
It had no power to override the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), thus making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often called, on geographical position, an 'archipelago'.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the early 15th century when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, begins a transformation in aboriginal wheat production practices and employs Chinese labourers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Much of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by twelve to obtain the nearest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) match this aspect ratio, or are very similar to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs. I
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 14 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employment manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each stage of China and each ruling family were distinctive dynasties.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability with the provinces divided. The best known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms era between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods of time there was fierce warfare between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China where thousands of men died fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of being class-based, army ranks were now caliber-based.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He frequented a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, clearly shows Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
On top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find anything even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except a beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains surrounding it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still in existence today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidlike structures erected in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The 'upper' and 'lower' tick marks shall be in the shape of a V and shall be in the shape of a rectangle without the lower edge.
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start at the fringe (the place where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the downstroke is louder and more assertive.
You can make the marks you want with a pencil, but remember that the bow marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, normally, must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a violent mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a car surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their car windows wide open.
On one occasion a member of the mob beheaded a royal guard who was executed at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you have to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which the events took place was commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological push or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher occurrence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicentre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels move slowly, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the great developments of that time as a result of the crusades was that people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses raised seeds that are native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel forgotten by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by using a distinctive and symbolic style, including mannerisms, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods of demonstrating the importance of socialisation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misadventure or deliberate abuse, were not socialised by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the children was due to the parents' rejection of the children's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child displays behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that took care of it, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the so-called scaffolding learning method is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold but even the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalised into the software and aims to query, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons involving from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it still happens.
We view the Foster Care System as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in her previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and satisfactions.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that similar abilities in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blend the variation "back and forth between the two groups with" each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately getting up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm that wakes you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, thus forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded by the mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is Goddess Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities one clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Germany was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war the disagreement in system, process and culture led the countries to fight.
Just two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise across the Rumen bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them as an easy source of milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in grazing herds on hills or other grazing areas, and were often attended by goatherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn wagons to achieve greater speeds and to pull greater loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced quite early to hold the rails in place.However, gradually, it was realised that rails would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron at the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases.Nevertheless, if we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems, and we must deactivate it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly due to mankind's scientific and technological advancements, and the problems have become greater due to mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten bill signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy is no longer extant.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and pointed claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with cockroaches, which are very suitable insects as parasites of humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nest-adapted, adapted to live in a nest or in the place of their host.
Across the USA, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of the Greek language, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic indications, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycling even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people to visit rural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to parks and study of ecosystem information.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's small towns by car to go to work and pass other people whose place of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is, in some way, linked to, and supportive of, a private car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of grumbling about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air.Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot retract their wings are mayflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than eight times the water of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at some points six miles wide.
Altogether, the Amazon accounts for 20 percent of all the water that pours from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and the best in the technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which, at the time, were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all matter is composed of a combination of "one or more of four" elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now type messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near a typewriter.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something newer is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is taken to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill, splitting the nucleus again then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that tend to split with little effort.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the near side and 100 km wide on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people happy or attractive.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature to adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues.
This type of manager finds difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and brand it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team as their teams may meet in different time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?One of the goals for putting learning organisation concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuous Sequence approach as a method being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical proof of the theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus narrowing the research field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brain.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as built into various home computer software applications and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every class.Often, a teacher likes to take her students to places where there is no possibility to go by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips.Students can look at museum artefacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes this situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog starts working to improve the writing so as not to be criticized.
Blogging also "makes students more aware of the world around them".The need to satisfy the interest of the audience inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs 'can' empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writing and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and contains a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what it means to be Canadian abroad.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling state that she is married, regardless of her current marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring too (just not one that looks expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to assert your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese broke it up and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name "Casablanca" by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a full spectrum of geegaws, but they're all touristy.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city streets, in particular the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the state of the fighting that still persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for trekking to the Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special series "Wonders of the African World".
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African elements.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in southeast South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is spread over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is regarded as the epitome of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in the case of all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and park entry.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission either to selections of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus for many tourists.
The deployment of the buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a brightly lit bar chart as seen from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land on the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists made their home and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves in wetlands - they include some of the last remaining stands of the towering jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts contain small Japanese Coaster Bus services, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, it is 378 metres long and has two carriageways 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadores with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known as having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to see what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular 'wet' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance.These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
However, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa.This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-nineteenth century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located within the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly sandy beaches that are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is unfamiliar. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is heavily creamed (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards.The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Still, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety messages.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the northern hemisphere and can sometimes be seen outside these times.
Although sharks do exist, they rarely attack people.Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendment or change request must be passed to the travel agent in the first instance and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival-goers decide to camp on-site, and many consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may be over, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location carefully, as ice crossing makes a horrible noise for those most affected.
St Petersburg cruises include time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find exit points.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer free alcoholic drinks.However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a short time to make you stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or flying or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in most countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the focus of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to travel overland to observe Africa's wild and wonderful animals, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and near standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes camouflaged and best seen through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a 'bush walk', 'hiking safari', or 'going 'footing') consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be hosted elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Walking on wet clothes can help them to dry.Many hotels have a walking rail and a walking board available for use, even if you do not have one in your room.
If a curling iron is not available, or if you do not want to wear socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to allow the fabric to become too hot (which could cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter unfamiliar ski animals in the regions where they stay.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often passes through isolated expanses of backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate.
The maximum speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit dishes are common, and cooked apples are used in dishes all year round, and cherries and plums start in summer.
Many German meals also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want small but rich meals, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry may be 'dry' or 'juicy' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers the great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cooking, which is now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavourings favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Braces are a support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse escapes.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow heel and breast.
Subsequently, some exits, in particular English exits, have safety bars that allow the leather strap of the staff to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley (Wied Cochamó) - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large granite and rock walls.
The highest points offer spectacular views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes through the endless potential of its walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered ground on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as 'ski bums', planning entire holidays around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called 'backcountry skiing', 'ski touring' or 'ski hiking'.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, ski touring or alpine style mountaineering, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking - but it is only very rarely that you will have the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it contains many independent countries.Usually, to travel through many countries you have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and documentation.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture around trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and kept reindeer mainly as animals to pull heavy loads.
Today many Sámi work in modern trades.Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although used extensively, especially among non-Roma, the word 'Gypsy' is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of other governments rather than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often rapid, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe hailstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone organising a visit inside a country that could be considered a war zone must undertake professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile environment course' is likely to bring up the address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role play, a lot of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but there are not many publications on war zones.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue gender non-declared (X) passports or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents similarly varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking on the beach, often in a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a fast current to deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to fatigue after trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be recaptured or, depending on your skills and if you have not been spotted, you may prefer to wait for rescue.
The re-entry shock precedes the culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and may be more severe.
Travellers who found it easy to adjust to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your cultural habits from your home country.
When you first arrive, people are likely to be patient and understanding, for they know that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the highlights on the children's side.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually the sound of tourists and vendors is always present.The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the sunken caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge into the plain, then rise again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone does not generally replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely by voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your home country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for sailing. e 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the distinguished Baltic Cruises include an extended visit to St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for about two full days while returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you leave on land only using excursions on board you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the brochures.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have about other things.
For some, a basic understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or on things over which they have no control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.Often, time is of the essence in the case of commercial documents, cargo or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you have sent the goods by air, on some routes it may have taken days to clear unloading and customs.
The only way to speed up the process was to send it as checked baggage.Airline regulations do not allow them to send unattended baggage, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your airline to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it does not make sense to look for discounts for business and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge for these things.
The capital city of Moldova is Chişinău.The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic links have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling business centre, built around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
You won't regret spending half an hour strolling around the quaint village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's laudatory description of its great beauty.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the north he visited the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Chapel), site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are, in essence, visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who managed to survive their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and practically everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are marked only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruption is announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, aloof, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is still to behave well, and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well brought up).
The unfriendly attitudes of Parisians quickly disappear when you show them basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes nature park is heavily wooded, mainly beech, spruce and pine, and contains a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, kookaburra, lynx, wildcat and wild roe deer can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover both knees and shoulders.
Many monasteries provide a solution for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or sister at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-length trousers.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance but those clothes are not washed after each wearer and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cooking, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and available condiments such as cheese, tuna oil, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
This certainly facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are "c" and "g", as their pronunciation varies according to which vowel follows them.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the phrases better.
Obviously, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain as museums, or educational venues.
Since light pollution at their peak was not the kind of problem we have now, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The display of cherry blossoms, known as 'hanami', has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the peony was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in natural surroundings, so resist the temptation to remove even 'one' specimen.
If you visit a formally organised garden, collecting 'samples' will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But when you are placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both heat (always) and bright sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
A few buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruises to interesting cities on the Danube or boat trips along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by unbelievers in Christian and non-Christian lands around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, crawling or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey and so the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark all the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution therefore often does not cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the emphasis on group effort rather than encouraging individual achievement.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they take, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without reservation.
