While one experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, so far, none of the drugs have been shown conclusively to be effective in treating the infection already in the body.
Another combination of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but official studies have shown that it is less effective than desired in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as the control arm, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.

Not only does this mean that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already widely understood, but it provides details that fossils in general cannot confirm, such as color and three - dimensional arrangement.
The animal's plumage, say the scientists, was chestnut - brown above and dull or "carotenoid" below.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a rigid neck, called a "rachis", but have other feather shapes - spines and cones - researchers understood that the rachis was a later development than these other shapes.
The shape of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for heat regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that, even though this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult, not juvenile, feathers.
The researchers reasoned that even though this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of a large one, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two policemen and injuring more than two dozen others.

The work done was more than creditable, but the program was written to stimulate observations of the constellation Sagittarius.
The collision the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way has a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
According to this theory, the bulk of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is in a halo-shaped region made up of many tiny particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech affair: voters scramble into booths, slip a printed piece of paper identifying their candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter drops his envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' roll.
France's electoral law makes this process crystal clear.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be clearly visible so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered voters that have been duly counted.
Elected representatives are sent to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following detailed procedures.

He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on trial for the murder of her son.
He has been detained pending his indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be suppressed because his picture has been widely published.
This is common in the UK but the justice system in Scotland operates differently and courts have considered the publication of photographs as a potentially damaging event.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that "journalists seem to take risks if they publish photographs, etc., of suspects".
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for general prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until charges are filed.
The document, according to its unauthorized release, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other reported points of discussion include the future status of the city of Jerusalem, a holy site for both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continuous presence in the valley for a period of ten years once an agreement is signed with the PA agreeing to relinquish such sovereignty for only five years.
The shooters in the pest - control experiment had to be closely monitored by rangers, for the experiment was monitored and its success rate measured.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunters program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Curator of Conservation and Historic Parks, the four marksmen selected for the shooting operation received extensive safety training and drills.
Martelly swore in the nine members of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures leading the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests have been hampered by the failure to hold elections, which have not been held since 2011.
Some 60 incidents of malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had identified 27 appliance-related hazards.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-critical".
The department responded by calling Apple's filing "truly unfortunate".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday night).
The Northern Mariana Islands' emergency management office said there were no reports of damage to the community.
But the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino police officer arrests Hong Kong tourists after their bus is hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several fishermen have been rescued and six are now confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
Photographers later photographed the home of an elderly homeless woman. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births on his own time.
His research showed that if the hormone were administered it would accelerate lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found the flight recorder's black boxes on Wednesday.
Other superheroes have paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Replacement. She was my first boss. Luna died two months ago. This is something special, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as amazing as me...and maybe more...we loved her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place now".
In a survey of 1,400 people conducted ahead of the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia's shift to the Republican Party increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty - four percent of those polled share this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Among the extreme opponents of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 - and 200 - meter freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his hearing complaints, he lacked confidence.
He was unable to use the drugs needed to relieve his pain because they were banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of earth's water supply with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists have hoped to understand the origin of the planets, especially the origin of the Earth, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same - sex marriage.
These rumors, he said, are "just political noise and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than ground - based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate planes more accurately and to provide pilots with more precise information.
Additional transport is being installed so that overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and bus facilities are available at the stadium.
Fears of transportation shortages have raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the birth of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported a new species that originated in just two generations, although this process is believed to be much longer, as a result of interbreeding between the more common Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and an introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape. It can be molded into any mold.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be rolled and plated.
It can be made very thin, even glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the juice is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Wrap two dry sticks together and, with two clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will come into contact with the outer layer, which will crack and form a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sanitation systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the signal and relays it back to earth, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use space telescopes because Earth's gravitational field distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in remarkable ways, but its greatest contribution is its ability to make our lives easier and our journeys faster.
It has brought us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium - sized cats that eat medium - sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are the many small cats (including domestic feral cats) that feed on countless small animals such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is their strategy of adaptation, a special function that each cat possesses that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most active of the big cats, living in groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as as many as thirty females and cubs.
Female lions are usually close relatives, a large family of brothers and sisters.
Herds of lions behave like herds of cubs or dogs, strange animals that resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, but are also dangerous to their young.
A gifted athlete, the leopard can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times the weight of a man.
The leopard (Genus Panthera) belongs to the same family as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The lion's roar is not like that of a full - grown lion, but it makes a loud cry.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are smaller.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate their prey (the wildebeest) by scent, smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they can move with great agility, too.
When a small group of organisms (a population) becomes separated from the larger community from which it came (such as if it moves to higher mountains or a river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot return) it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This environment has different uses and different competitors, so the new herd will need new structures or habits to be stronger competitors than what the children needed before.
Your original flock is completely changed, still requiring the same adjustments as before.
As time passes, the new herd will need to begin to adapt to its new environment, gradually becoming more like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this the process of speciation, which simply means the beginning of a new created species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an essential part of nature.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, expel from their bodies).
Plants make their food from the sun through the process of photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaurus was the most fearless predator of its time, so it was fearless, except for other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were packed with more than 70 razor - sharp teeth, plus another set in the roof of its mouth, which meant that nothing could escape its clutches.
We do not know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly a lizard.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a dinosaur as large as T. rex could not jump at all.
Although many of the foods eaten by the Romans were familiar to us, they did feast on some strange or exotic foods, such as watermelon, peacock, snail, and rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their meals on couches, the rich men preferred to be together at banquets where they could gossip while eating their meals.
The diet of the ancient Romans did not include those that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia centuries later.
For example, their food did not include corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans did not know the taste of turkey.
For each god, the Babylonians constructed a huge temple that was viewed as a dwelling for the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests attended to the gods' needs by means of rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes special pyramidlike towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary of the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not of great importance.
Hebrew families spent much of their time outdoors in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were in open counters overlooking the streets.
Forests were scarce in the land of Canaan, and wood was expensive.
According to Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, but on a journey farther west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even though he discovered this land, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' the peoples, rulers, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had many things in common.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written after the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776".
While it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that when this large scroll (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was new, it was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it is possible that the inscription was inserted merely as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them rather than fight them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies occupied southern France in an operation called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were now on their way to Germany.
A civilization is one form of a very large group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis and civitas, meaning capital or independent city, and in a sense, these words describe the size of a nation.
Autonomous cities build communities. Social culture provides a means of transmitting knowledge from generation to generation, a model of continuous culture and equitable distribution of knowledge.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind the necessary historical evidence and without being recognized as socially valid.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as only one part - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and in the absence of a national cabinet or courts, it relied on the often uncooperative state governments to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to cancel the customs duties and taxes paid between the states.
The Charter required the agreement of all the developing nations before changes could be made, and these nations despised the central government so much that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the North, where Italians compete in international and Olympic events.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan occupies, Japan is often called an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and reported the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India company set up camp in southwestern Taiwan, revolutionizing native grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the ruling Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of Qing Colony in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it cedes Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until the year 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings at the end of the enclosures have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most popular motion picture format is 35mm, the size that dominated the closing years of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but the key point is that its ratio is integrated into the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is somewhat confusing, being 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the ratio of this form (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3.2.
Many popular shapes (the APS family of shapes, for example) equal or approximate this shape ratio.
The often abused and often overlooked rule of thirds is a simple guide to begin to see the magnitude of change or dynamism while maintaining some control of the picture.
It states that the most effective location for a subject is at the intersection of lines that vertically and horizontally divide the picture into three sections (see example).
At this point in European history, the Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, came under intense scrutiny.
For a thousand years, the Christian faith has united Europe despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
From king to commoner to saint, all felt its shattering power.
One of the fundamental beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be earmarked for that very purpose.
For a thousand years, the church's administrative headquarters had been in Rome, and the church's growing power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine had been properly followed.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain began blockading German shipping.
This strategy worked, for it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated the generally accepted law codified in many international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the sea, and it was dangerous even for ships not involved in the war.
Since few nations responded to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response in its submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the trend among many peoples and nations was toward pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and carnage of war during World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 US cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different times; each Chinese dynasty or family that rose to power was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty there were also unstable periods of divided provinces. The best known of these is the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
In those days there were bitter struggles between many rulers for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in Medieval Chinese history, with thousands dying in a struggle for supremacy over the mighty imperial palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system of measurement, the shift from monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also after the French Revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants, bringing prosperity to the ambitious and successful.
It is similar with the military because instead of ranking in the army according to social status, people are now ranked according to ability.
The French Revolution also encouraged many other oppressed, working-class people in other countries to start revolutions in their own areas.
Muhammad had a keen interest in matters beyond ordinary life. He often went to a cave that came to be known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) to meditate.
This cave, which still exists today, testifies to Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Perched atop one of Mecca's mountains, the cave is isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you knew where it was. Once you enter the cave, you will be completely alone.
All you can see is a clear blue sky and a surrounding mountain range, and from your vantage point in the cave, you can see and hear very little.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many monumental pyramids erected in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and a colossal statue, or Sphinx.
A huge pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" looks like a V and the "down bow" looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means that you should start at the tip and move the arrow, and down means that you should start at the hook (where your hand holds the arrow) and pull the arrow.
An arrow pointing upward usually produces a soft sound, whereas an arrow pointing downward produces a loud, piercing sound.
Feel free to write your marks in pencil, but remember that the arrow marks are there for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Queen Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of women merchants.
Transported in a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a noisy crowd that shouted threats against the King and Queen.
A mob forced the King and Queen to open all the windows of their carriage.
On one occasion an angry member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard executed at Versailles before the frightened Queen.
The cost of America's imperialist war in the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes by the American colonial dictatorship to set aside a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government for the use of Wall Street banking houses.
It is true that the huge profits made from the exploitation of the Filipino people were a major source of income for the American imperial treasury.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the events that led to the founding of the order.
The period during which these events took place is often referred to as the Dark Ages, a period of European history during the years 1000-1300 AD or the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.
The Dark Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is believed to have ended about the year 1500.
'Technological determinism' encompasses a broad spectrum of views, ranging from the impact of technology or the usefulness of technology to the firm belief that the outcome of human affairs will be determined by technological concepts through scientific laws and the application of technology.
Most critical interpreters of technology share a general view: that technological development itself follows a much broader trajectory than nationalism or political influence, and that technology has "feedbacks" to the society of which it is a part, as opposed to being socially controlled.
For example, one might say that the automobile led to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The invention of the automobile also leads to a high incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the introduction of new technologies in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism, or Romanticism, has a strong element of cultural determinism, in addition to such writers as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the case of Romanticism, places influenced people's perceptions, and over time local customs and traditions developed that, according to the geography of the community, were superior to the laws they were forced to accept.
Whereas Paris has a reputation for being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
It is famous for being a major center of entertainment from the year 400 A.D. until about the year 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the 12th century because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices that were considered more valuable than those sold in Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the status of the City of Fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
A style of dress popular between the 10th to the 11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slowness of communication, western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe developed its own style. One of the great innovations of the period thanks to the crusaders was the use of buttons for sewing clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and/ or his family members.
Organic gardening is a simple, natural practice that uses local, environmentally friendly seeds and yearly crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced small - scale agriculture, and the same is true in many developing lands.
Microclimates bring together like - minded people who feel excluded by social norms and give them a sense of belonging.
Microcultures give people characteristics that distinguish them based on their age, race, social status, geographic location, and/ or gender.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive, whether it be language, accepted standards of behavior, religion, gender, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often express their cultural identity through the use of distinctive and representative styles, idiosyncrasies, and street slang.
One of the most popular methods used to demonstrate the importance of social acceptance is highlighted by a few tragic cases of children who grew up rejected by adults, either through neglect, abuse, or deliberate molestation.
Such children are said to be "unruly" or feral. Some unruly children have been confined by humans (often by their parents); in some cases abandonment in this way was the result of the parents' denial of a serious mental or physical disability.
Unruly children may have been badly abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals rather than by humans, a feral child displays behaviors (according to its physical capabilities) that are almost identical to those of some animal caretaker, such as its fear of or aversion to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, teaching independence goes beyond that.
Self - instruction is not a method of learning but a supportive aid for learning something new, such as using a computer program or starting a new project.
Tutoring can be done virtually or in person, in other words, a tutor is a type of tutor like a small Microsoft Office paperclip.
Virtual Autonomy is built into the curriculum and is designed to ask questions, motivate and explain procedures that the student may have been too busy to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for many different reasons, including neglect, abuse, or exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of proper nurturing, care, and education, but unfortunately this is what happens.
We understand that placing such children in the Adoption Program is a safer option for them.
Our foster - care system should provide children with safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Adoption is supposed to provide children with all the necessities that were lacking in the family from which they were first taken.
The Internet has combined the two worlds of mass communication and peer - to - peer communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet give rise to other characteristics of user behavior and content.
For example, it is suggested that important motivations for using the Internet are "learning" and "being social" (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "developing relationships" as new motivating factors when investigating the ways people view websites.
The use of video recordings has yielded valuable insights into the interpretation of tiny gestures, tiny facial movements that may last only a few seconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell when someone is lying by accurately interpreting subtle facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge when someone is telling the truth.
He even suggested that animals such as domestic dogs might have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two distinct groups of genes: recessive and dominant.
Their mutation adds a new genetic variant, and its adaptation to the environment removes it from the gene pool.
Separation and reconciliation drive a back-and-forth between the two groups in every generation.
In the wild it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to obtain its amino-acid requirements from the abundant vegetation available.
Moreover, failure to do so has dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most readily available plants would be the proteins found in pulses and foods such as beans and peas, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (mushrooms, insects, eggs) are not only digestible but also rich in proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the wild.
Sleep disruption is the intentional waking up at a regular bedtime and falling asleep a short time later (10 - 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you are asleep, it can be placed on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other regular choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
A person's level of peace of mind is directly related to his level of physical and emotional stress.
The lower the stress, the greater the health benefits. Everyone has the potential for greater satisfaction and fulfillment.
Knowledge is accessible to all. The only thing that can thwart this goal is our own stress and lack of balance.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded upon by the mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is generally very simple. It has Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (power of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga preparation, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is God Yoga. By seeing the different gods the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are awakened and a sense of enlightenment begins.
The common enemy during World War II was Germany, which resulted in the alliance between the USSR and the USA. When the war ended, these countries had poor relations because of differences in administration, customs, and culture.
Within two years of the war's end, the two allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was to be fought, as a proxy conflict, on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense forces had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize in Romania's stronghold.
Almost overnight, however, these plans were thwarted when the Soviet Union's Red Army of over 800,000 troops swept into the battle lines of Belarus and Ukraine after occupying parts of eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is a highly efficient means of transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of navies has always been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the best-known recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to block traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hunt them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, which were often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or adolescents, much like a well-known shepherd.
Wagons were developed by England about the beginning of the 16th century.
Although the chariots were made only of planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to travel faster and to haul heavier loads than could be done on the more congested roads.
Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails could be made more efficient by adding a small amount of steel to the top.
This became a common practice, but the iron would corrode the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, the world's first railway was built.
The earliest known form of human locomotion was walking on two legs, humans first walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
The ability to walk on two legs is found in the remains of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many ways, this is similar to treating the symptoms. However, if we are not to look for short - term solutions, we must now get to the root of the problems, eliminating them.
Clearly, much has changed in the world as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and the high cost of living.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten letter signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop nearby.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides", were made.
The public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the lawn of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that another group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Most people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the management of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common for immediate diagnosis.
A good indicator of indoor poisoning is the presence of a solvent for open medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first - aid instructions for the poison.
The word 'bug' is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The word is derived from a common ancient understanding of Bedbugs, insects that are shaped in a way that makes them ideal as human parasites.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs require care after hatching, being accustomed to living in a nest or in the house of their predator.
Throughout the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle - aged adults
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to develop MS.
The couple may decide that it would not be in their best interests, or in the best interests of the child, to raise the child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works in a scientific manner.
By extension, an experiment, or trial, is an investigation used to test one or more hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations that guide scientific investigation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient writings, especially the Bible in Latin.
What was accepted were Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many have seen that physiological rhythms and behavior are often largely dependent on the existence of natural cycles in our bodies and their conformation to designed rhythms.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not simply responses to seasonal external cues, have been recorded for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Synchronous clocks are self-sustaining rotating objects that will continue in a self-sustaining cycle in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading proponents of DNA genetics.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They have developed two tests to tag the DNA of invading pathogens with radioactive phosphorus or the proteins of invading pathogens with radioactive sulfur.
The resulting changes can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene involved, and whether the affected cells are progenitor cells.
Only mutations in the genes can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature - based tourism invites nature lovers to enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and reading about the environment.
An example is the travel, photography, and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small country towns drive to work and pass by others who serve in their home area.
In this form of transportation everyone is in some way connected to, and supportive of, a car - based transportation system.
Science now shows that this presence of carbon displaced nature from one of its most stable states that supported human evolution two million years ago.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear the same degree of complaints about water quality or falling skirts.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Do transportation engineers fail? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a similar way; thus, traffic tends to be uniform and can be represented mathematically.
To better visualize traffic flow, relationships have been established between the following characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so enabled them to evade predators with ease as well as to find food and mates successfully.
Many hatchlings benefit from the ability to fold their wings back over their body.
This gives them plenty of room in small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as other stars).
This is understandable, for the Earth does not seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and the largest river on Earth, with eight times as many waterways as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to four miles [6 km] wide.
Fully 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of tributaries.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were not surpassed in size and beauty for their unique engineering.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the statues of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least densely populated country on earth.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of working people in a district where Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People knew about basic chemical building blocks such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity, as these can be found in nature in a local form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle said that all matter is composed of one or more elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was analogous to the four states of all matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he hypothesized that they evolve into new liquids to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
It may contain alloys that include nonferrous elements in trace amounts, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of a combination of energy and matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a valuable companion for many when it first appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing systems, the pencil has been relegated to second place.
People now type messages on a computer screen, without ever having to be near a typewriter.
One wonders what will happen to the keyboard when something new arrives.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It has been likened to pushing a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart if they are pushed or not pushed at all.
The Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The surface is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the near side and 60 miles [100 km] thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the lunar valleys and thicker below the lunar rocks.
There may have been many lunar valleys on the near side because of the thinner surface.
Motivation theories are based on finding out what irritates people and what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/ or desires that are instilled in them as they develop into adults.
These theories look at what really makes certain people want what they want and what factors in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories of motivation are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Roughly speaking, the two behaviors may merge as the two bosses begin to dominate their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, reviewing tasks, assigning responsibilities, and assigning blame.
In another, one becomes an outsider who feels compelled to change everything the group is doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often creates tension between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Computer groups operate with the same aesthetic standards, similar to normal groups but with subtle differences.
Computer networks normally serve as a conduit between closely related virtual networks.
Many have more autonomy than members of a typical group and therefore group members meet in different time zones that may not be understood by local supervisors.
The existence of a virtual "invisible community" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a special feature of the computer community.
The "invisible group" is the governing body to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of shutting down a learning organization?
When all available resources are put to good use in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can result.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new process of innovation to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and learning in the organization.
Angel (2006), defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neuroscientific data provide tangible evidence of a pattern of thinking in cognitive processing, thus narrowing the search and making it more precise.
Comparative neuropsychology and behavior support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that a variety of brain injuries, strokes, tumors, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in other mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unseen brain structures and functions.
This provides a wealth of information and tools for building models of reality that help us understand the inner workings of our minds.
Although AI has a strong focus on science fiction, AI forms a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and machine intelligence.
Research in AI involves designing machines to perform automatic tasks that require human thought.
Examples include managing, planning, and scheduling, the ability to respond to problems and customer inquiries, as well as to read handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
Such things have become different values, focusing on providing solutions to life's real problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as embedded in personal computers and video game software.
Often a teacher will want to take his students where it is not convenient to travel by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of a virtual school excursion. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or enjoy the beauty of nature while sitting in their classroom.
Joining a school field trip is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share what happened with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the State Capitol, each year the websites are rebuilt, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an archive.
Blogs can also help students with writing. Although most students start their blog with poor writing and spelling, the presence of many readers changes that.
Since students are often very critical readers, the blogger begins to try hard to write well so as not to be criticized.
Blogging also "forces students to be more aware of their surroundings". The need to feed readers' curiosity encourages students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004)
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and it encourages students to learn beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more critical and analytical; by responding specifically to online resources, students can articulate their positions through comparisons and express their thoughts on topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and home to many galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south of Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled home of the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these factors and more weigh on Ontario's being viewed as truly Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas in the far north are sparsely populated and in some cases almost deserted.
A startling statistic: There are more African - Americans living in the US than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is particularly large, and it is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are sovereign states, or dependencies, of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was reintroduced by the Arabs, and it enjoys great popularity among the Comoros and the Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling mention that they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but a plain one is more expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may have a bearing on what they may perceive as abuse and that it is not unusual to be followed, handcuffed, and so forth.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right).
The modern town of Cablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese tore it down and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan ruler rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive shopping areas in all of Morocco.
In the old Medina, it is easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and many other interesting items, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far south of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by an eruption of Mount Nyiragongo that flooded many of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Despite the relative safety of Goma, all visitors from outside Goma must be screened to understand the nature of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The town is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and other inexpensive destinations in Africa's Monkey Mountains.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. A typical fare (in that area) is 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
In addition to its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has recently come to be used figuratively for strange, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its fame makes it a popular tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The town is quite different from the country towns, for it is much more influenced by Arab culture than by African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature reserves, each containing a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most beautiful of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African National Parks, there is a park maintenance fee and an entrance fee.
It may also be advisable to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a shimmering grid pattern created by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, get off the island and head for the opposite Kowloon beach.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the area that the British colonists have now claimed as their own, for if you are looking for evidence of the colonial history of a region, this is a good place to start.
The Disundarbans is the world's longest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80km (50m) between Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps though - they include the last remaining tigers that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 1,400 square miles [3,850 sq km], one third of which is covered by wetlands
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 antelope have now been seen in the area.
Buses leave from the central bus station between the two districts (across the river) throughout the day, although often, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between two districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Many prefectures are served by Japan's small, comfortable, and sturdy Coaster Buses.
Shared taxis are fast and a convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The twin towers are 275 feet [83 m] high, 1,200 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
Completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when border crossings into Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were a prominent indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi nomadic hunter - gatherers who grew just enough food for their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Maguaycurú and the Payaguá, who made their living from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, called the "Great Province of the Indies", came into existence as a result of the interaction of Spanish explorers with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
From its beginnings in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its national character and identity.
Argentina is well - known for having one of the world's leading polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
Smaller competitions and games are also viewed here at other times of the year.
For information on competitions and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will normally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted.
In the outer islands credit cards will not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with the owners before it is too late to find out which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Located south of the Equator, Montevideo alternates between summer and winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the heart of the tropics; during the summer months, temperatures in excess of 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winters can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but air and moisture combine to make it colder than a thermometer reads
There are no specific "rain" or "winter" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many zoo animals are accustomed to humans, wild animals are nevertheless aggressive and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all wildlife.
No matter how gentle they may seem, buffalo, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
These animals are large, wild, and dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid handling or preparing odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a bloody naval battle in 1889 when seven German, US, and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During a struggle for independence organized by the Mau, a peaceful town meeting resulted in the assassination of the local chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, for Auckland is situated on two harbors.
The North Bay beaches (North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most are shaded by palm trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Bay, on the luxurious sands of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
At times, the beaches are crowded with families and a row of shops lining the bay.
The number one local beer is 'Number One', not a mixed beer, but delicious and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be slightly better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to obtain if you are afraid.
To Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is unfamiliar. Black coffee is called 'espresso,' cappuccino comes in a round (not square) cup, and tea is available without milk.
Chocolate coffee is at the Belgian level. Juices are expensive but good.
Most trips to submerged reefs are made year - round, and injuries from any activity on the reef are rare.
Still, accept advice from authorities, respect all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present along coasts and near estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770' s. They can be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans; most are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not used to living in the sea, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rochhampton.
Making reservations in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Tour operators usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you may be able to arrange other types of accommodations, such as camping, through tour operators.
Tour operators normally provide arrangements that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or a combination of airfare and hotel.
They can also make a reservation for you if you need time to think about the arrangement or to make travel arrangements (for example, a visa)
Any adjustments or requests must first be made through the tour operator and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most concertgoers choose to camp out in the open, and many attendees view it as an integral part of what they are doing.
If you want to see what is going on up close, you should arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the big-band music has ended, there may be parts of the festivities that will continue late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
To cross the North Baltic in winter, make room for a log cabin, as walking on ice can be very noisy for the most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. No visa requirements for cruise ship passengers (see conditions).
Casinos normally make an effort to keep visitors spending as much time and money as possible. Windows and wall clocks are usually up and exits can be difficult to find.
They normally have special food, drinks, and entertainment, keeping guests happy, and keeping them in the area.
However, drunkenness often impairs good judgment, and compulsive gamblers know the value of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or bitter cold.
On icy roads, it is very slippery and not as smooth as tarmac.
During blizzards, there may be enough snow to keep you trapped for a while.
Apparently, it can be prevented by falling or blowing snow or by fog or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy or snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted year - round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction and a favorite with many visitors.
The word safari in common usage refers to a journey into the countryside to see Africa's amazing wildlife, especially in the open plains.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles at close range, and standard equipment can give you a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen well through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle walk", "hiking safari", or simply a "walk") involves exploring the countryside, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with other events taking place at venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics, as it did in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation in 2020 before bankruptcy was declared, you may be in a difficult position.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, the timeframe for which the Olympics are scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing about ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if you do not have one in your room.
If an iron is not available, or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective than others.
In some places one minute of boiling water is sufficient, in others several minutes are needed.
Separators work, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter insect pests that are unfamiliar to their home areas.
Insects can spoil food, cause itching, or in the worst case make us sick, transmit toxins, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can seriously injure or kill humans, are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods that are exempt from customs duties and taxes in some jurisdictions.
Travelers to high - tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmount creates very difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which frequently passes through empty forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: minefields, narrow streets, and sharp curves abound.
The posted speed limits are notably lower on the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and obeying them everywhere is more important than not.
Surprisingly, though, cell phone service is better here than in other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pies are delicious, and Bavarian ones are rich and varied, like those of neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit pies are popular, with boiled apples served year - round, and cherries and plums available during the summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, nuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often accompanied by a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich pies, try the locally made Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen
A curry dish is a dish prepared with herbs and spices, as well as meat or vegetables.
A curry may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common ingredient in curries; in South India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the region.
When used without qualifiers, however, the word usually refers to food from the interior and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
As in all island groups, Javanese cuisine includes a wide variety of easily seasoned foods, the Javanese favorite being nuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
The stirrups are footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide great stability for the rider but can present safety problems because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged off as the horse runs away.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, narrow heel and toe.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety catches that allow the stirrup skin to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier mountaineering destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of limestone walls and cliffs.
Climbers from all over the world continue to find new routes through the seemingly endless walls of space.
Downhill skiing, which includes cross-country skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding down a snow-covered slope with skis or snowboards strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist attraction, and enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", plan an entire trip at a ski resort.
The concept of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is a sport that dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia
Backpacking: This is also called backcountry skiing, snowshoeing, or cross-country skiing.
Associated with but not commonly involving the alpine style of skiing or mountaineering, alpine climbing is done on steep terrain requiring sturdy skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
Under ideal conditions you will be able to cover longer distances than on foot - but you will rarely find the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack on paved roads.
Europe is a very small continent made up of many sovereign states. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would mean going through many visa and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, acts as one country in this respect.
As long as you live in the area, you can cross the border normally without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for all Schengen countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies from place to place, with the age limit being lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be described as vintage items, even though they are newer than similar mass - produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding it is also important to many who have other occupations.
Traditionally, though, not all Sámi were heavily involved in reindeer husbandry, but they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, keeping reindeer as pack animals.
Today most Sámi work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi homeland.
