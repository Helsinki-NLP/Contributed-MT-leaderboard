Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already popular theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally do not, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and pale or carotenoid below.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a fully developed bone chain, called a backbone, but possessed other features of feathers - such as bumps and small projections - researchers concluded that the backbone was most likely an evolutionary outgrowth of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that although this tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not a chick tail.
The researchers noted that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers and not chick feathers.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gajah Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries .
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of a red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness may be questionable since her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered that the publication of photographs may be prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that ""It seems to me that journalists are certainly going in a dangerous direction if they publish photographs or likenesses of suspects".""
The Crown Prosecution Service indicated to reporters that there would be no further comment until at least after the indictment .
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1387 war borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pesticide experiment had to be closely supervised by guards, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers have been selected under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunt received extensive safety instructions and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth temporary election in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that had begun in February.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted over the failure to hold elections scheduled for 1432.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating malfunctions have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of crashes, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded to Apple's call to postpone the report as "really regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (Friday 12:19 a.m. Mecca time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a possible tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took two Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila , the capital of the Philippines .
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The cameraman later substituted for an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1937.
Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
He has shown through his research that when a hormone is administered it will accelerate lung maturity in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders or "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Luna was also praised by fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was my first drag queen. My first manager, Luna, died on a moonlit night. A strong, unique woman"," said Tommy Dreamer.
"Dustin "" Goldust "" Runnels commented, ""Luna was as eccentric as I am ... maybe more so ... I love her and I will miss her ... I hope she is in a better place".""
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 1431 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 1429.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 1431 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed agree with this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, 29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist's fitness was called into question by his complaint, as he was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn 't take pain medication because it was forbidden in the games .
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime so far in 25 moves.
The discovery was verified by multiple people using different hardware and software in early October and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivered to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how the Earth formed since the collision of comets with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo , 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage .
He dismissed the rumors as "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is likely to run for president in 1437 A.D.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There is no additional transport and no tube stops at Wembley, as well as no car parks and no on-street parking and access facilities.
Concerns about transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, away from fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although this process was previously thought to take much longer - due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized ground finch, the migratory cactus finch, and the sharp-billed ground finch.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and stretched. It can be rolled or folded into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It is called the pH of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator of this number using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are electron-deprived protons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Flip the dry powder together and squeeze it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sanitation systems have been found in Minoan houses on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together in mixed company.
When you communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and rebroadcasts it almost instantly .
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has dramatically changed the shape of the world; however, providing an easier and faster means of transportation remains its most important contribution to us.
He provided us with trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of status , a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The lion family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closer together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Tigris) as the lion, the jaguar, and the jaguar. These four are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's roar, but it is more like a shout of angry words.
The leopard gecko likes to eat small animals; it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can. Almost all the animals the leopard gecko hunts are small.
Scientists believe that domestic cats track and locate prey by scent; they sense where they have been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and are also very stealthy. Panthers hunt their prey by identifying their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a few populations) becomes separated from the main population to which they belong (for example if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it previously did.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, and still require the same methods of adaptation as we are used to.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look too different to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants as well. Without plants, animals could not survive.
It was the dominant predatory dinosaur of its time, so it feared nothing, except other dinosaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 razor-like teeth plus another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning it had no escape for anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other dinosaurs, and it was probably carnivorous.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual holiday items, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a vole.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals seated on benches, the rich men liked to hold feasts together where they reclined on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of their gods and considered it the home of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs during festivals and feasts.
Each temple has an open courtyard that leads to a secure enclosure that only priests can enter.
Unique pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the square; shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Greenland has been inhabited sporadically. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Grønland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there previously.
There were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of the countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated January 18, 1190 A.D". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this part of the text is not known with certainty, we do know that the large manuscript (293⁄4 in × 241⁄2 in) was a folded storehouse early in its existence.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings of D-Day and subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
France was ruled by the Vichy. These were the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1359 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 February 1359, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a community.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin civilis, meaning civilian, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also determines how the social mass is constituted.
Autonomous cities are the progenitors of nations. The culture of a civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable distribution of knowledge.
Microcultures often disappear without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, it has no authority to override interstate taxation and tariff laws.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all of the states before they could be amended and the states resented the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the second most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 1927.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, sledge hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1033 AD, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change native grain production practices and hire Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1094 CE, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1053 CE-1330 CE) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1302 CE.
In 1312, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1311-1312, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1364.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1396 A.D., thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image shooting format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Production has continued to the present day, but more importantly the image sensor layout in digital cameras has inherited the image width to height ratio.
The 35 mm model is a bit confusing, actually; it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this image (when divided by 12 to get the ratio of the smallest integer) would be 3:2.
Many common formats (the set of AVCHD formats, for example) equal or approximate this aspect ratio.
Misused and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in a clear image.
The most dramatic location of the main subject is said to be at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European countries together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power he possessed affected everyone from the king to the common people.
A central Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church coffers exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this focus on power and money led many to question whether it met the requirements of orthodoxy.
Britain soon began blockading Germany by sea after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law that had been codified and harmonised in various international conventions over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent shipping from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1901, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each of China's stages or dynasties in power was of a different type.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war arose between various nobles for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest seats in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to the ruler alone.
Also after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the army because instead of being based on rank, army classifications are now based on ranks.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to foment their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that transcended this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor for meditation.
The garment itself, which has survived through the ages, provides a very vivid picture of the Prophet Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain to the north of Mecca , and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all even if you know it's there. Once you're inside the cave, you're completely alone.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky over the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century CE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramids built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (most notably the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and a Sphinx.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
An "up arrow" looks like a V and a "down arrow" looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
A higher sign indicates that you should start at the tip and push the bow, while a lower sign means that you should start at the end of the bow (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull it.
The upper bow normally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to make your own marks in pencil , but remember that curved printed marks are there for a musical reason , so they should always be respected .
Horrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced on 17 October 1204 to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and chanting against the king and queen.
A crowd managed to force the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
A gangster once waved the severed head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The Filipino people bore the brunt of U.S. imperialism's war costs in its invasion of the Philippines.
These were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the principal gains of U.S. imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the Order, in order to understand the Templars.
The era in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages and is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (390 CE - 700 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which ended around 893 AD.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a trajectory largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on societies inherent, rather than associated with, society.
For example, one might say that an automobile engine necessarily leads to better roads.
But building a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new roads are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, leading to the development of new technologies in healthcare to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, which, being in harmony with a society's location, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris was renowned as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 493 AD.
Its condition declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were of higher value than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Paris was dubbed the capital of fashion rather than Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, patterns in the West may lag by as much as 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming, often organic, is a simple system using stored seeds adapted to the local ecosystem, plus crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Most farmers historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel alienated by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through a varied and symbolic use of style that includes clothing, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the unfortunate few cases of children who experienced neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, and were not socially attached to adults during their upbringing.
These children are referred to as "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Abandoned children may have experienced childhood abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been domesticated by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, a feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of its pet, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a support tool that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new business.
Interactive learning can take place both virtually and in the real world. In other words, a tutor is a form of interactive learning, as is a paper clipper in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning in the program is supported internally and aims to ask questions, stimulate, and explain actions that may be difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured and cared for and educated, but they are.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children .
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The alternative care must provide all the necessities they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage patterns and fulfillment modes.
For example, some have suggested "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""ongoing relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites".
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks noted in his paper that the president's speech indicated that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared with some animals, such as pet dogs.
Twentieth-century research has demonstrated the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a latent group and a manifest group.
Mutations add new genetic variants, and selection removes them from the pool of expressive variants.
The processes of segregation and recombination cause variation to randomly shift back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will also lead to serious consequences: growth suppression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources were proteins that could be obtained from leaves and beans, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide protein in high amounts and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors somehow solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet stimulant to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options, based on biochemistry, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positivity your life force gives off. Everyone has the potential to find lasting peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment . The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity .
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visualizations, with Kundalini Yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war, a clash of regimes, actions, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
This war was to last for the next 40 years, and be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 Ramadan 1358, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.
The function of a navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interdicting your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to repel this invasion by using submarines.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Carriage roads were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railway carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and to haul larger loads than the roads that were considered more rugged at the time.
Rail tracks were invented relatively early to stabilize tracks, but it later became apparent that placing an iron bar on top of the track made it more efficient.
This became a common practice, but iron further eroded the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1181, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the earliest mode of transportation. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a consistent manner.
Two-legged forms have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Coelenthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity's scientific and technological advancement, and the problems are only getting bigger due to the increasing population and people's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as Dunlap's Cash Registers.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the balcony of Independence Hall on August 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on August 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on August 9. A copy reached London on February 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios represent the earliest surviving copies of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version is not known to have survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
It had webbed feet and claws, was oviparous, and walked on its hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary form.
A binary digit can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indicator of internal poisoning.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug"" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, insects that are highly adapted to infest humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are characterized by long incubation periods, and are adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their children .
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not unique in this regard, an experiment is a test that can be used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of self-cycles and produced by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Circadian clocks are self-oscillating that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first demonstrations that DNA is a hereditary material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
Two experiments were conducted to label either the bacterium's DNA using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including the wildlife, flora and fauna.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work and meet others on the way who are working in the place they just left.
In this dynamic mode of transportation, everyone supports and is connected in some way to a car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this large carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems . Everyone complains about transportation systems .
Similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, yet fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic has a reasonable consistency, which can be approximately expressed mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a larger variety of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense , because you don 't feel the ground moving , do you ?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching 6 miles in width.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza are unsurpassed in size and engineering excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most workers in the country, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that all things are composed of some combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumed that they transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are, of course, minerals such as silver and gold as well.
You can also find alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing instruments, the pencil was relegated to lesser status and uses.
People now type messages on computer screens, without having to use a mirror.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will look like when something newer comes out.
A fission bomb works by collecting energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
It is like rolling a heavy car up a hill. The nucleus splits again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to disintegrate with little or no movement.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands .
There may have been more lunar maria on the near side because the crust was thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that automatically emerge when they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two common content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
In general, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to dominate their former peers: one is an attempt to remain "like everyone else" (or others).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary procedures, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the contrary, the individual is transformed into an unrecognizable person who feels he or she has to change everything that the group does and has.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same distinguishing criteria as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical communities.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams as their teams may be assembled according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" has been described by Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p. 109 as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the management team, the "Invisible Team". The "Invisible Team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to create a learning organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are utilized effectively across functional departments in an organization, creativity and efficiency can be achieved.
As a result, synergies within the organization to overcome obstacles can result in new innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience-related data provide concrete evidence for a theoretical approach to knowledge inquiry. This narrows the search area and makes it much more precise.
The connection between neuropathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain as never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been used to build various software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are a big part of any semester. Often a teacher will want to take her students to places where going by bus would be impractical.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reminisce about a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins by seeking to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to feed the public's attention inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; by responding effectively to online material, students can identify their own positions in the context of others' writings as well as identify their own opinions on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada 's charming bilingual capital city with an array of galleries and museums that highlight Canada 's past and present.
In the far south are Niagara Falls, and in the north are the beautifully unspoiled nature homes of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a startling demographic comparison: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
The island of Madagascar is the largest of all, and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual marital status, women travelers must declare that they are married.
It is worthwhile to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they may consider harassment and that it is common to stalk them, grab them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (don't let cultural differences make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1168.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least exciting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as tiaras, pottery, leather goods, shisha and all sorts of cheap goods, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 1423 Goma was devastated by an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially in the downtown area.
Any visits outside Goma should be sought to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can ride a boda boda (a motorcycle that doubles as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the typical price (locally) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides being relatively difficult to reach, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for distant foreign lands.
Nowadays Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport.
In 2011 it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stations on the PBS series The Special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is regarded as one of South Africa's major tourist attractions, and its park is one of South Africa's major national parks (South African National Parks).
There are daily fees for maintenance and entrance to the park, as in all national parks in South Africa.
It may be worth buying a Wild Card , which allows you entry to a selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks .
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists visit.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a glittering diagram rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong , leave the island and head for Kowloon Waterfront on the opposite side .
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is where the British colonists made their home, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) through the coastal hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water.
Since 1385 AD, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses leave the inter-district terminal (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those to the east and Jakkar/Boomthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between neighborhoods are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "coaster" buses that are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Barrow (No. 150) and Punahou (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and São Jorge do Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in February 1432, and it was not opened to traffic until the spring of 1438.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in Ramadan 1438 AH, at the same time that the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of a confrontation between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 943 A.D., Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in Algiers , on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas .
In addition, smaller leagues and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island 's only bank located in Stanley across from the West Vic FIC West store .
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted.
On outlying islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners about acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you should exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains roughly constant throughout the year, as there are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals may attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a safe distance. These animals are large, fierce, and considered endangered, so they should be given their own space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1379.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1306 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave port.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans were drowned.
During the Maoist-organized struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount leader Topo Tamasese Lilufi III.
Because Auckland is situated between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the sandy beaches allow safe swimming, and most are shaded by baobab trees.
The Tamaki Road beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are often crowded with a good selection of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main folk beer is known as "Number One", which is not a complex drink, but a pleasant and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more popular.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water, if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is made with a layer of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards . The fruit juices are excellent , although they are expensive .
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and damage to the reef rarely occurs for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April in the northern 1770s. They can sometimes be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Although you may find that it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even package deals that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action , you should check in early to get a campsite near the music .
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stages may have ended, some sections of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing the ice can be very noisy for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises involve spending time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain an entry visa (see conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are often no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment, to keep the guests in a good mood, and to keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs good judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as on smooth asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall to stop you for a very short time.
Falling snow, blizzard conditions, condensation, or ice on car windows can limit visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to cross-country travel to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to vehicles and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, leopards and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle trek" or "hiking trip" or "hiking") consists of walking long distances, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from October 16 to October 28 in 1443 A.D. Some of the events of the Games will be held at secondary venues in different parts of Japan.
With its hosting of the 1984 Summer Olympics, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 1441H before the postponement is announced, you may face a critical situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late spring, most coronavirus-based cancellations did not occur until around 1441 AD, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen while a typical standard ticket will cost about 7,000 yen .
Drying wet clothes helps dry them . Many hotels offer an iron and a drying table for rent , even if they are not in the room .
If there is no iron available, or if you prefer not to wear iron socks, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Don 't make the fabric too hot (which could cause it to shrink or burn in the worst case).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute , in other areas you need to boil it for several minutes .
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealable bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their native areas.
Pests may spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly infect or kill people, are not usually described as pests.
Shopping at a duty-free shop is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain areas.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on spending on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in previous and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important.
Oddly enough, cell phone service seems to be stronger here than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania woods.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are popular where apples are cooked in the pastry throughout the year while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Folk cakes are often eaten especially with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small rich pastries, try the so-called Berliner, Fancochen or Krabben depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry seasoning may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in a curry dish, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, as Indonesia has 17,000 islands to choose from.
However, if used without additional terms, the term tends to imply that the food originated in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of mildly spicy dishes. The predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a rider falls off his horse but gets his foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most equestrians wear riding boots with soft heels and very tight soles.
Secondly, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety rails that allow the occupant's fur to fall off the saddle when it is pulled back while the occupant is getting out.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
