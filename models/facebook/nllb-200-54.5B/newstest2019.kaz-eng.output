When a person reads a book, he should think about what he will get out of it.
Our teacher Askar Tokpanov: I saw you speak on TV.
It's not bad.
He said, go deeper into your mind, read Abai, and don't look away.
He recited all of Abay's poems by heart.
I also read a lot of Tolga verses, along with the poems of Abay and Mugahali.
I read it over and over again.
It will help you to remember what you read.
When I was young, I had a good memory and could fall asleep quickly.
Today, all of this is my wealth.
In fact, I'm very sociable and talkative.
My soul is poured out into the lap of the wicked: he hath crushed my hands in the dust.
What a blessing!
This month I will receive 42,700 tenge.
Whoever hates me has given me so much joy.
Now, that may not sound like a lot of money to some people, but to me, it's a lot of money.
Now everything is for sale, from utilities to food.
The money you put in will pay for one of them.
May he bless you.
Thank you to the President!
The situation of the country is improving , and this is what is meant by &amp; quot; if the country has it , it can afford it , &amp; quot; Yerzhanov said .
This elevator was a relic of the Soviet Union, which was not used in the 90s.
The company &amp; quot; Elevator Agrofood &amp; quot; has restored it as much as possible and now sells high-quality wheat of about 30 kg.
On the one hand, China is interested in wheat from our Torgai region, on the other hand, the Arabs and Russia are interested in it.
In the near future, we will install a German mill with a capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, which will employ another 10-15 people.
We think we can afford to pay more.
Today, 22 people work at the elevator.
We have increased the salaries of 5-6 people earning 32-33 thousand tenge per month .
And that's just the base salary.
Work in agriculture is not always measured by time, and sometimes additional work is necessary to pay extra for the hour , - said the executive director of the elevator Kurman Abdrakhman .
The limited liability company &amp; quot; Elevator Agrofood &amp; quot; is aimed at further development of quality storage and processing of durum wheat .
Now it is being refined and sorted for shipment to Iran.
The President &amp; apos; s instructions will be implemented without fail.
If we do not develop the economy, if we do not benefit the country, why are we here?
This should be the duty of every entrepreneur , - said Kurman Turganovich .
A good businessman keeps his word.
The fact that the bloodthirsty red gendarmes of the Soviet Empire celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol with great fanfare in all cities and settlements of Kazakhstan is a criticism of our country.
This means, first of all, that the Komsomol "spit" on the Independence of Kazakhstan.
Yesterday in the city of Semipalatinsk, the cradle of the Kazakh statehood, the followers of the Red Army led by Nurlan Omarov and former Komsomol leaders celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Red Army.
Once again, I saw red pioneers wearing red ties in schools in Kazakhstan, and I liked it.
And now, when I see that these Russian slaves, that is, slaves without a surname, have begun to openly poison the minds of the younger generation of Kazakhs, I can't say anything to these scoundrels...
How can we understand that these Komsomol members confiscate the independence of Kazakhstan and say that we are slaves of Russia?
It's a shame, because a slave's name is slave.
Ana Tasmagambetova, Aitimova, Sultanovs - their own admission that they are in fact obedient slaves of the colonialists, their open expression of their "unlimited love" for Russia - should be understood, first of all, as an open recognition by today's followers of yesterday's red guards of their Russian identity, which we still deny.
As the author of the famous work "Comrade Kolbin, I will drag those bloodsuckers by the hair and bring them to you and punish them", I, the poet Zhumash Koburi, will not forget the atrocities committed by mothers during the Soviet empire, namely in 1990, when an hour-long radio play was made on the radio "Azadliq" in Munich, which made waves around the world!
At that time, the Kazakh people did not forget!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as a native of my nation of Kazakh origin, I openly condemn the followers of these red gendarmes!
I declare openly that if our state is really an independent state, the day will come when the eternal president of this state will publicly punish those who openly threaten the Independence of Kazakhstan as traitors to the state in front of the people or the whole country!
"My country, my Kazakhs, my heroes" (Abai), this was the moment when the whole country openly denounced the Red Army.
Awake, my Kazakh, for history will never awaken from your slumber.
Don't you ever forget that, Kazakh!
In India, the air is being cleaned.
India is working on a technology to purify the air with artificial rain.

Usha, a local resident, said: "The air has been smoggy since morning.
You can't even open your eyes.
Children can't go to school.
And I went out into the field, and took my rest, and opened my eyes.

Because the air is so polluted, it's hard to breathe.
I was reminded of the clean air of my homeland and how much good work is being done in Australia.

There are a lot of film festivals in the world, but Bastau is a really successful one.
The international level of the festival is beneficial for students, and we get a glimpse of what the future holds for cinematography.
Of course, there's the Oscars, there's the Cannes Film Festival, but you can't just go there, so it's nice to have a stepping stone to the big prizes, like Startup.
The most important thing is literacy, a new way of looking at the world, we want to open the way to the world of big festivals for unknown, young talents, - says Jago Mateo Velasco.
Honored guests of the festival were invited Dean of the Faculty of Film Production of Korea University of Media Arts Kim Yong-doo , sound director of Mosfilm Marina Nigmatullina and cinematographer and lecturer of the University of Karpenko-Karogo in Ukraine Yevgeny Filippov .
The jury and guests of the festival will hold creative meetings and master classes with Almaty students of cinematography and film professionals .
All events of the festival will be held at the National Academy of Arts named after T.Zhurgenov and Turan University .
The platform of the international film festival is important for young people.
From the very first job, a student should see what competition is like, not only what his classmates are shooting, but also how his peers in other countries are searching.
The participation of the film in the festival is one thing, but the exchange of ideas with the filmmakers is quite another.
Getting started is an essential step in creating a creative relationship.
Despite the difficulties, despite the difficulties of making a step into the big cinematography, cinema is developing.
Film festivals are very important for this purpose.
Film is a collective work, the international film language is universal, and we contribute to its development.
Here we not only watch films, but also learn how to make them , said Sergey Azimov , president of the festival .
According to the organizers , the festival of student films , which was interrupted in the Soviet period , continued in the period of independence and this year is held for the 7th time .
Despite the difficulties, the film festival has survived, having managed to arouse the interest of the film community.

The Russian market is interested in Kazakh halal products .
And they laid up corn and wine in abundance, and laid up food in abundance.
Zlak + M company has been producing pasta since 1999.
Their products, popular in the regions of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, have now reached the Russian market.
Our products are Halal, which is becoming more and more popular among consumers.
The exhibition was well organized, but we did not see many competing pasta producers, but the exhibition area is always useful.
We met with several companies, and they gave us good reviews.
The townspeople often asked us to sell the products we took to the exhibition.
All the products from Kazakhstan were in great demand , the company &amp; apos; s sales manager Petr Shaulsky said .
Even before the exhibition began, Chelyabinsk residents stood in line to buy Kazakh goods.
The dairy plant " DEP " in Kostanay has been known in the Chelyabinsk market for many years.
According to Vadim Yamaletdinov, a representative of the plant, the company was forced to transport its products to the two-day exhibition several times.
At the Chelyabinsk market, the products of local producers are more expensive, but the quality of our products is not inferior to theirs.
We sold milk at the exhibition at producer prices, which will certainly please the buyers.
The main thing is that the buyers were convinced of the naturalness of our products, that the milk is not powder, but real natural milk.
Many people asked me: "How can I find your products in the region?"
" DEP " is now working to cover the entire Chelyabinsk region , and then we will go to Ekaterinburg , Vadim Yamaletdinov said .
Do not be deceived.
The mouths of fools and liars will be stopped.
Now they are using the power of social media to make easy money.
Recently , the metropolitan police arrested a 23-year-old resident of Taraz on suspicion of fraud on the Internet .
According to investigators, the fraudster created an account on Instagram and posted information about the sale of skin tones and leather goods.
In order to attract people's attention, he advertised the price of fur shades at a lower price than the market.
Noting that delicate women are attracted to skin tones when the weather is cold, she showed pictures of girls in beautiful skin tones and even the addresses of department stores.
She was so desperate for fame that she used WhatsApp to communicate with her "clients" so that the country would not recognize her voice.
To attract customers, he promises to deliver tons of goods to their homes.
The seller asks to transfer 100% of the purchase price to the Qiwi-wallet in advance.
What do you care?
Those who believed the testimony of an unknown person transferred from 100 to 300 thousand tenge to the account of the fraudster.
Thus, within a month and a day, he deceived 7 residents of the capital and pocketed 1.5 million tenge.
"It's over, it's gone", they say, counting their dirty money, blocking their numbers, closing their accounts, and going broke.
However, the scheme did not succeed.
Law-enforcement officers tracked him down and put him in handcuffs.
Currently , a pre-trial investigation under Article 190 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (fraud) is being conducted against the suspect .
Last week , the controversy surrounding " kaspi.kz " also caused a stir .
On WhatsApp, the following information was circulated: "Bank head Mikhail Lomtadze took the money of depositors and fled abroad".
The reason for this rumor was a technical malfunction in the mobile application " kaspi.kz " on November 1 .
Even the leaders of the media were sent classified emails.
However, the false information was denied by the chairman of the board of the bank, Mikhail Lomtadze.
We received the same message.
He wrote that I had escaped from Kazakhstan.
But I'm in the country, sitting in my office.
We are preparing for the national holiday &amp; quot; Kaspi Kozhym &amp; quot; on November 16 , &amp; quot; he said in an interview with one of the republican channels .
In Germany, a Kazakh woman got into trouble for hitting her daughter.
In Germany, a Kazakh woman was deprived of her child for beating her daughter.
According to the head of the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan Aibek Smadyarov , the incident occurred a few weeks ago .
The girl told her teachers that her mother had beaten her.
Local authorities separated the girl from her mother because German law forbids child abuse.
" Now the woman together with lawyers is preparing the necessary documents for the court , " Aibek Smadyarov said .
During the investigation, the girl will stay in a children's home.
The Consul of Kazakhstan met with the girl and is in constant contact with her mother.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do everything possible to return the girl to her family.

The Head of State supported the idea of establishing the Day of Shymkent .
Today , at the meeting on socio-economic development of Shymkent , the mayor of the city Gabidulla Abdrakhymov asked the President to establish the Day of the city .
Historians argue that Shymkent was founded 2200 years ago.
Now we are preparing special documents for UNESCO.
But even after all these centuries, the official date of our city has not yet been set.
The special status of our city was established by a special decree on June 19 .
In this regard , the city community proposes to establish the Day of the city , - said G.Abdrakhymov.
The President did not object to this initiative.
However, it was suggested to start the day of the city based on concrete historical data.
In fact, Shymkent is an ancient city on the Great Silk Road.
There is Shymkent, Taraz.
In fact, I have no objection.
If we say 2,200 years, let's call it that, let's start there.
But it is necessary to prove it , Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed .
It should be noted that at today &amp; apos; s meeting , the President of Kazakhstan outlined specific directions for the development of Shymkent .
Rules for the fight against "black archaeology" will be approved.
After the "black archaeologists", the monuments were left open and destroyed.
This was announced by the Minister of Culture and Sports Aristanbek Mukhamediuly during the presentation of the draft law &amp; quot; On protection and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage &amp; quot; in the Majilis .
The issue of regulation of archaeological and restoration works on objects of historical and cultural heritage requires revision .
It is no secret that our unique monuments or unexplored objects are often subjected to search and excavation by "black archaeologists", after which the monuments are left open and partially or completely destroyed.
In addition , there are cases when intensive construction works carried out in the territories adjacent to the objects of historical and cultural heritage have a significant impact on the historical integrity and preservation of monuments of history and culture , leading to negative consequences .
In general , there is a need to strengthen the tasks in the legal sphere , which require specific regulation and the creation of favorable conditions for the protection and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage , the minister concluded .
According to him , in this regard , at the legislative level , it is planned to establish a procedure for identifying and recording objects of historical and cultural heritage , as well as monitoring their condition , introducing qualitatively new mechanisms for preservation and use of objects of historical and cultural heritage in their original historical appearance .
In addition , it is proposed to establish rules and conditions for conducting archaeological works and combating " black archaeology " , regulate the legal regime of use of land plots in protection zones , construction of monuments of history and culture , determine the legal regime of use of natural landscape zones .
In the process of drafting the law , international experience was studied and taken into account .
For example, the Russian legislation includes measures to combat "black archaeology" for conducting illegal archaeological research, stealing archaeological objects, evading the transfer of artifacts to the state and others.
That is, criminal liability is provided.
In Italy, there are obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
According to them , it is planned to create and periodically update lists of objects of culture and art of historical and artistic interest and private ownership .
At the same time , the objects owned by the owners of these objects , regardless of their nationality , citizenship , are subject to state protection , - said A.Mukhamediuly.

In addition , scholarships were paid to these students , the total amount of damage to the state amounted to 8 million tenge .
A pre-trial investigation is being conducted on this fact .
