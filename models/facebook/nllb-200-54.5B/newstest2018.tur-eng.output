Our cosmic visitor is the giant asteroid 2014 JO25 .
There are billions, perhaps more, of giant asteroids wandering around the solar system that could have serious consequences if they hit.
These objects, which can have closed or open orbits left over from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass by the Earth.
2014 JO25, a 650-meter-diameter asteroid, is one such visitor and will pass within 1.75 million kilometers of Earth at its closest approach today at 14:24.
This kind of news is becoming more and more frequent.
This is mainly due to improvements in observation techniques and instruments.
We'll be able to identify smaller asteroids that we couldn't identify before.
Last January, for example, an asteroid the size of a school bus passed within about a quarter of a million miles [250,000 km] of the earth.
And what's even more interesting is that the asteroid was spotted just a few days before the flyby.
So there could be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
Imagine if you got the news that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter was going to hit right in the middle of your neighborhood.
Well, asteroids that size probably won't destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow out the windows of every building.
This will be caused by the shock waves from the asteroid exploding in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that hit Russia in 2013 was this size, and it was enough to shatter the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you're in the neighborhood of an asteroid that's 100 meters in diameter, you're advised to go at least 50 kilometers away from your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact determine the depth of the crater and the damage caused by the impact.
Let's look at a few scenarios based on simulations by the European Space Agency.
If a 100-meter-wide asteroid were to hit the Earth at a 45-degree angle at a speed of 60 kilometers per second, it would create a crater about 250 meters deep and 1,200 meters wide.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale, and you'll get third-degree burns on your body even if you're 10 kilometers away from the point of impact.
30 miles away, they'll be looking at smashed windows.
It's even more depressing if it's hit by a mile-wide asteroid.
If such an asteroid were to hit the Earth at the same angle and velocity, it would leave a crater about 2,000 feet [600 m] deep and eight miles [12 km] in diameter.
I mean, an entire neighborhood could be turned into a crater and instantly disappear.
Because of the heat from the impact, you can get third-degree burns on your body even if you're 60 miles away from the point of impact.
The impact was equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage caused by an asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid but also on the rock composition of the area it hits.
The above values refer to a scenario in which a hard rock-like asteroid crashes into a region of sedimentary rocks.
If the asteroid is made mostly of iron and hits a surface formed by cooling lava, the crater will triple in size and the resulting disaster will multiply.
And 66 million years ago, something even worse happened to the dinosaurs, when they were wiped out by an asteroid about six miles across.
75% of marine and terrestrial life was instantly wiped out by the asteroid impact.
If an asteroid as big as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs was headed for Earth, the safest option would be to leave the planet.
Tons of stuff falls to Earth from space every day.
Most of it burns up in the atmosphere.
Some meteorites large enough burn up in the atmosphere, causing flares commonly known as starbursts.
Let's end with another piece of good news.
Studies indicate that an asteroid large enough to cause serious destruction is not expected to hit the Earth for the next 300 to 400 years.
As creatures who live an average of 70 years, I'm sure you're relieved.
Flash bet for the prize: 10 million euros!
The name on the agenda for the Black and Whites who want to reinforce the Stoper area is Gary Medel, who is considered certain to leave Inter...
The 30-year-old, who recently returned to training with Inter after playing for Chile in the Confederations Cup, is awaiting offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, one of the prestigious Italian newspapers, suggested that Beşiktaş had made an offer of 10 million euros to Inter for Medel, who can play both as a stopper and as a front libero.
It is stated that the Black-Whites, who made their offer to Medel, are waiting for a response from both sides, while the Chilean footballer is said to be looking forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite the Gazzetta's claim, the FFP limitation makes it difficult for Black Eagle to pay a price like 10 million euros for Medel.
The Black and Whites are likely to sign Medel on loan, as they did with Caner Erkin, or with a significant reduction in his services.
Beşiktaş announced the transfer of Negredo to the stock exchange
Human rights group issues travel warning for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel warning for people of color in Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The state of Missouri NAACP Travel Advisory Notice, effective August 28, 2017, advises African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise special caution and extreme caution when traveling throughout the state as outlined therein, due to recent suspicious, race-based events occurring throughout the state".
The NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, but also that the state's law enforcement practices disproportionately target minorities, which was influential in the group issuing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations happening to people.
They're being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin", Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We're hearing complaints at a rate we've never heard before".
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racist slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while driving across the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
Chapel said, "The advisory is for people to be vigilant and to warn their family, friends and co-workers that they may be in Missouri".
"People need to be prepared, whether it's bringing bail money or notifying relatives that they're passing through the state".
In Missouri, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which puts the state 16th in the country for the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a business for discrimination in housing or employment.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states' local governments passed immigration enforcement laws ordering the arrest of people for immigration violations; the ACLU says this will increase enforcement by race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
It's Demba Ba at the Beşiktaş
Demba Ba, who transferred to the Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million Euros 2 seasons ago and was rented to the Black and Whites in the middle of last season, returns to Beşiktaş for free.
Black Eagle, who requested a detailed medical report from the Senegalese player last week, acted on the report from the star footballer.
The Black-and-White management knocked on the door of the Shanghai team, which started working for the 32-year-old player, whom the Chinese representative did not consider in the squad for next season.
Not in the list .
Demba Ba, who was not listed due to his status as a foreigner in China, has informed management that he wishes to return to the Black and Whites.
The Chinese team has approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to arrive in Turkey in the coming days to sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated on at Trabzonspor
Castillo underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery on his left knee at Istanbul Liv Hospital, according to a statement on the club's website. "After the surgery performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar, our player is expected to start training with the team within 4 weeks".
Castillo injured his right hamstring in a preseason game against Dutch side Heerenveen at the camp of the burgundy-blue team Slovakia.
The Colombian player, who was announced to be away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to treatment, was also decided to be operated on due to a meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
The referendum exit from Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at a commemoration ceremony in Duhok to mark the third anniversary of the ISIS attack on the Yazidis in Sinjar district of Mosul.
In his speech, referring to the independence referendum that the ICFI wants to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say this with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country".
We've tried everything with Iraq, but we're completely helpless and hopeless.
Our past experience with Iraq has brought us to this point, and there's no guarantee that we can get our rights and be protected.
That's why we need to show the whole world that we can determine our destiny through a referendum to ensure life and security together.
I must stress that the referendum is not an end in itself, but a means to a greater end.
Recalling that after the fall of the Baath Regime in 2003, the Iraqi central government made many promises to the Kurds, Barzani said that the direct referendum decision was taken after the fight against Daesh, saying that the disaster in Sinjar occurred soon after.
"The documents show that Iraq, as a state, is unable or unwilling to protect us", he said.
"He doesn't want us to move forward".
Reacting to the fact that the central government of Iraq did not provide them with weapons during the fight against the terrorist organization DEAŞ, but the Hashdi Shabi, which was established with a fatwa in a short time, was immediately legalized and all weapons were provided, Barzani noted:
Within Iraq's defense system, the Peshmerga were not addressed.
The central government didn't do to the Peshmerga what it did to the Hashdi Shabi.
The Peshmerga are constitutionally considered part of Iraq's defense system.
But with Hashd al-Shaabi not having a presence in the constitution, all means were mobilized in violation of the law.
We're not saying we're against the Hashd al-Shaabi.
The Peshmerga and the Hashd Shaabi fought on the same front, so why is the presence of the Peshmerga and the fight against terrorism covered up while the Hashd Shaabi is legitimized?
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On 3 August 2014, ISIS attacked Yazidis living in the Sinjar district of Mosul, killing many people, including women and children.
He came back from the brink in 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the Air France Boeing 777 was west of Hokkaido in northern Japan when the North Korean missile was launched.
Officials estimate that the missile came within 100 to 150 kilometers of the plane, noting that it landed in the area 10 minutes ago.
Air France said in a statement that the missile did not intersect with the plane's flight path and that there was no problem with the flight.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the plane's route", the statement said.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues.
Americans know as well as anyone that the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what he was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to severely restrict legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, a bunch of boat tour operators and Liberty impersonators would lynch him.
But he attacked its meaning, and particularly the meaning attributed to it after Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the base of the monument in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.
Addressing Acosta, Miller said, "I don't want to get all historical here, but the Statue of Liberty is a shining symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's actually right, but as he says, it's not really about history.
This relates to the contemporary echo of Lazarus's chilling words, only in these a state seems to be inviting not only some elderly immigrants but also the poorest of the poor: "The weary, the poor, / The crowded masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched unwanted of the crowded land".
Never before has the "miserable unwanted" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't making a literary criticism; these people were explaining that Trump wasn't welcome in the United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a larger political and cultural battle: it's really a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his companions, who after his death campaigned to have his words put at the base of the statue, were well aware that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The statue was intended to celebrate the links between French and American republicanism by representing, in a clichéd metaphor, Liberty's incarnation in female form.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in his poetry, the female figure was no longer abstract, it had a voice.
And she gives herself a very unusual name: the Mother of Exiles.
The poem's marriage to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrantism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, the great Baptist John bullshitter for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Liberty didn't invite anyone in, but rather was an early neocon keeping the American fire burning in a darkened world:
It exists to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to light the way to the United States of America".
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about perception.
Lazarus's great creative act was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often terrible voyages.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who are seeking refuge and want to improve their lives.
His statue responded with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would find in any way justified.
Their torch is not to guide but to ignite their only source of power, hatred.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots could make the Great Britain team.
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the Scottish group of 16 in the World Championships squad will make a "huge contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and UK athletics should learn from this.
Black said, "We're embracing it and we're trying to understand it and we're going to keep at it until we get it right".
"I've been talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish Athletics think it's about what they're doing.
British athletics: they think it's about what they do.
So is the guy in the alley around the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely wonderful".
Several Scottish athletes are vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been named as captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a little modest.
"The captaincy speech was incredible".
"Whether they're Scottish or wherever they live or train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and authenticity that Eilidh naturally brought to it was amazing".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best total at the previous world championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the middle-distance runner, who broke five British and two European records last year, leads.
He'll be competing in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another Scot to watch is 1500m runner Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including trials for the British Team and victories at the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move, as many of his countrymen will not only make the team but in some cases compete for medals and a place in the finals.
He added, "The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted on by the other members of the team, so it was already a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me".
"Obviously, I'm proud of all the Scots who made the team.
That's how far we've come.
And they're here as proven athletes, athletes waiting to get on the podium.
What about the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think that went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, in that we have a World Championship on our doorstep.
I mean, it's really just the impact of being able to take advantage of this infield support and the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium that we're successful.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete, and it's going to be such a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't take criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a thing or two about getting negative press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before newspapers began heavily criticizing him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
Of course, he was bothered by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away and we can be led stupidly and silently to slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the case as frivolous, and online comments were full of "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook".
But this is important.
It's especially important when you have someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who's surprisingly popular in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
He has the second highest approval rating of any of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a reactionary firecracker.
He showed great skill in leading his state and a firm commitment to principle.
He was also quite adept at using Facebook as his primary tool for connecting with his constituents, jokingly presenting his hairless head after chemotherapy.
So blocking people from visiting the governor's page, which is a public forum that is officially sanctioned and run by staffers paid for by the people's tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than editing them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hate-mongers verbally attacking people online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor; not trolls.
They all said their comments were disrespectful, inconsiderate and abusive.
In his post, the pastor quoted from the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
He wrote in the comment section of The Post's story, "I politely commented that I was disappointed by the lack of response to his hate crimes and other recent news".
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same issue, it is immediately dismissed by some as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff calls a "concentrated spam attack" others will probably call "advocacy".
The age of Facebook makes it easy to easily appropriate a message by blocking a dissenter or deleting a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to collect and burn critical newspapers or to arrest and silence protesters.
But, digitally, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the landmark rulings on this issue came from Virginia last week.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when it banned a voter from Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was visited by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable mail had a very similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had its unnamed trolls.
People using pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius all wrote letters to newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
According to the George Washington Papers Project, an online collection of historical documents, petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed the office.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent, and freedom of assembly are at the very foundation of our nation.
And real leadership means recognizing that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at the Renaissance Club in the comfort of his own home.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to be in the comfort of his own home over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in South Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who reached the final by leading the next gate before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feels a commitment to the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I watched the Renaissance Club being built, and with this organization we see it come into its glory".
The players will see the field at its best, in perfect condition.
Jerry did an amazing job setting this place up.
He's a tireless advocate for the game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great performance for this field".
Despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, British Eales will be fighting to defend a title for the first time in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special", said the Southport-based player.
"I never had the chance to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the calendar the year after I won it.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
It brings back memories from last year, and it was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was truly special and will always be remembered with fondness".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, is also making a return to the game on home turf.
This event will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, "It always makes a little more sense when you're fighting on the inside".
"You want to do the right thing, but you feel extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played some real golf.
I'm happy to go so far".
Joining the trio on the court are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the 6 Scots in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free and parking is available; there is a charge of £5 per vehicle with one person and £10 per vehicle with two or more people.
All the proceeds are going to Prostate Cancer UK.
I found the answer.
Imagine a "seat" with a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science, Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism!
The number of personnel is 117,378.
The biggest "propaganda base" in Turkey!
Yes, I'm talking about the Directorate of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I'm going to talk about Mehmet Görmez, the head of religious affairs!
For days... I've been searching for the answer to the question in my head...
I want to know the real reason why Mehmet Görmez was removed from his seat...
I've read every article about his transfer.
I don't have one.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DIB).
A Mercedes S 600 model worth 1 million liras was taken by President Erdoğan.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdogan.
So, what happened?
You may say, "Seven years in office isn't enough".
The first DIB President was M. Rifat Börekçi, who served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, as you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
I mean... the president's term is open.
Back to my question, why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
It's settled.
Proximity to Shiite
A source close to the government said, "According to the traditional ulema, Mehmet Dönmez's people were not circumcised".
The code of this sentence is: He didn't keep the circumcision!
The person who uttered this sentence bounced back: - "Found modernist by traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Görmez was seen as innovative.
What did he mean by innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden in a trip abroad of Mehmet Görmez.
The date is December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to participate in the 29th Vahdet Conference to be held in Tehran, which aims to bring together Islamic sects.
He met with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
He prayed with Shiite clerics in a line.
And in the lecture, he said, "The sects are schools of thought that have emerged over time, representing different views and opinions in the understanding of Islam".
They all want to find their way back to God.
And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so strive as in a race.
It is never acceptable to equate sect with religion or to put sectarianism above Islamic affiliation.
Sectarian division, alienation and conflict are a reflection of bigotry and ignorance.
When sects take precedence over religion, it is religion that suffers most.
I want to emphasize again by underlining here:
The Shia and the Sunni are one nation...
"No one can denounce another for not understanding and living Islam as he understands it"...
A year later...
The 30th Vahdet Meeting was attended from Turkey only by Jafari leader Selahattin Özgündüz.
I mean, I...
It's not Sunni, it's Wahhabi
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional ulema".
That's why no one representing the Turkish state attended the next Tehran conference.
Mehmet Görmez has been invited four times since he took office.
The reason was obvious: the anti-Shia "traditional clerics" at the DIB!
Immediately after his trip to Iran, Mehmet Görmez's chair began to wear out from the beginning of 2016.
At the head of this was the then Deputy Prime Minister, Numan Kurtulmuş, who was in charge of the DIB!
Mehmet Görmez was so choked up that he wanted "DIB to be connected to the Presidency".
The bottom line is...
There was a difference of opinion within the state about Sunnism.
Some "traditional ulema", whose theoretical worlds were formed in the madrassas of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, equated Sunnism with Wahhabi-Salafism in the shadow of the United States!
These were anti-Iranians who couldn't even tolerate a trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising that the robed Ahmet said about Mehmet Görmez: "The Diyanet has never seen anything more dangerous".
"Lord, give us a leader who is good to his nation and faithful to his family"...
They were using the term "Ehli Sunnah" as a symbolic concept of hostility towards Iran.
The CIA-backed anti-Iranian campaign that FETO had once waged was now being waged by new names.
And with the FETO conspiracies...
A photo of a young man with whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "Mehmet Görmez's son"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the newspaper Türkiye!
After all...
- Sunnism is resistant to the Saudi Wahhabi-Salafi line...
- That doesn't promote sectarianism...
- Modernist... a clergyman whose consciousness was destroyed by the "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
US cultural imperialism is continuing to rapidly Arabize Turkey.
Don't doubt that the next Head of Religious Affairs will be a representative of Wahhabi-Salafi!
"We support Turkey to protect its sovereignty"
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu is on an official visit to China.
Cavusoglu and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guesthouse in Beijing.
"We hope Turkey will participate more actively in international affairs", Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to safeguard its sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey", he said.
Regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said, "Turkey is seeking close cooperation with regional and international organizations, and international organizations are complementary to each other, not alternatives".
Ruhani is officially entering his second term.
The presidency of Hassan Rouhani, the winner of Iran's May presidential election, has been confirmed by the country's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Iran's newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran Reza Hakan Tekin attended the ceremony, which was attended by high-ranking military and political figures as well as representatives of foreign countries.
Rouhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office after a swearing-in ceremony in parliament on Saturday, August 5.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Turkey's Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekçi.
Security measures at the Cilvegözü Border Gate
Trucks carrying humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning materials will not be allowed to pass through the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Hatay's Reyhanlı district.
According to the information received, the Babel Air Border Gate located near the Turkish border and the Cilvegözü Border Gate were closed to transportation except for humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning material due to adverse security conditions in the area.
Aid trucks are being allowed through the Cilvegözü Border Gate.
There was no indication of how long the restriction would last.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
In fact, he rarely uses a pot.
A housewife places a sweet potato, often known locally as "nota", directly over the fire in her wooden house in Enarotali, Paniai regency, in the restive region of Papua, Indonesia.
Half an hour later, the charred tuber is removed and wiped with an appetizer, hands unwashed.
Degei sits on the muddy floor, with no furniture, doing menial tasks like washing clothes in murky water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a house without a roof acts as a field helmet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned to any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink too much, and there are soldiers.
He says, "Nobody walks around the village after 5pm".
A rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote by a public show of hands before troops invaded.
An existing movement propagating independence from Dutch rule quickly directed its anger at the Jakarta government, which maintained tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights watchdog organizations.
In 2003, the region was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern half of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate, involving a 90-minute flight from the regional capital, Jayapura, to Nabire and a stomach-churning five-hour drive in a rented car.
There is no public transportation.
The town of 19,000 people contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron roofs transformed by rust into various shades of yellowish brown.
Few Indonesians have traveled here, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, referring to her brightly colored, handwoven jacket, dark shirt, and bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies".
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, with 28 percent of the people living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
Yet, these riches, a source of misery for Papuans, provide a stifling existence for Indonesia's powerful military.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units approximately $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
The Papuans' call for greater autonomy threatens this golden goose and their rights are being ruthlessly infringed.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The Archdiocese of Brisbane's 2016 report "We Will Lose Everything" includes testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, including extrajudicial executions, torture (rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report), and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
As Papua's resources brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia, the pressures increased.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83 percent Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim migrants from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive for economic reasons.
Javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado, served with roasted chicken and vegetables mixed with peanut sauce.
The locals are having a hard time competing.
"The migrants sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than the local Papuans in the traditional markets", explains Abeth You, 24, a native of Paniai who moved to the regional capital, Jayapura, for work.
"This has caused the indigenous Papuans, the Papuan mama-mama's (women), to lose their market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter received the votes of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia, as he made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he would fulfill our hope that justice would be restored", says You.
In fact, Paniai's worst was just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle drove through the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers was offended by their manner and later returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
The victims and witnesses said that the group of soldiers, who had been drinking, chased them and beat them with the butts of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers opened fire on the group of children.
One of the boys, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and events escalated the next day.
Some 1,000 Papuan men, women, and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
As tensions mounted, soldiers were ordered over the intercom: "If the crowd offers more than three times resistance, shoot to kill".
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and pleaded for calm, urging the crowd to return home.
No one was willing to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist", he told TIME from the porch of his brightly painted wooden home.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shots, but he says the bullet came from a recovered military rifle.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired", he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, local man Alfius Youw was shot three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Yohanes, who like many Indonesians is known only by one name, told TIME gloomily.
"I saw her die... and I kissed her".
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" the station because it was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Branch Chief Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015, "We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us".
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the deaths did not reach Jakarta until the following day.
Jokowi made an impassioned speech three weeks later in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address historical abuses in Papua.
He said, "I want this case solved immediately so it won't happen again".
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had established a non-judicial mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the '90s, some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through".
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto backtracked, saying he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It'll all be settled by the law".
Wiranto said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been resolved, with the UN accusing East Timor of "crimes against humanity" linked to more than 1,000 deaths during the country's bloody 1999 independence vote.
The families of Paniai's victims greeted such claims with bitter skepticism.
"In the past three years, I have been interviewed four times, but there has been no progress", says Yohanes.
"I'm tired now".
Years later, he says he still lives in fear.
He says, "I'm scared".
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother, Yacobus, echoes the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by soldiers after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the soldier came looking for me".
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured when villagers clashed with the manager of a construction company who refused to help take an unconscious man to the hospital.
Twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Douw drowned in a nearby lake while fishing and died en route to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being brought in, told TIME, "We were very panicked, we were afraid of retaliation".
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
Deiyai's parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is fueling discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribal peoples who live scattered across Papua's verdant mountainous heartland.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claimed to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some are never seen again.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds on discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nuts, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can maintain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family and sell the rest at the local market.
10 notes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities grew between the indigenous Papuans and the new immigrants who arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs that are already scarce often go to better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant institutions", despite being rarely given permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting and improve transparency have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to cover Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting".
The lack of press censorship means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands) urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries that have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's claims, telling reporters in Jakarta, "Indonesia still has a democratic system and free media, so it is difficult to cover up evidence in human rights cases".
The locals want more foreign government involvement.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence with cries of "We want freedom", according to a source who attended the meeting and asked not to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack", says Gobai, the head of the tribal council.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that besides living under the imminent threat of the tyrannical military, they are also wallowing in poverty with meager education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote as a "debt" to Jokowi to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice".
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: burying the body of a victim in a field directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they will at least ensure that those responsible are not forgotten.
"A member of our family was killed", says Yacobus, bowing his head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire engulfed the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story structure.
This is the second major fire in two years to rapidly spread to the towering structure known as the Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given as to the cause of the massive fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighters extinguished the massive blaze around 4am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may reopen questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
Torch management's investigation after the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, the exterior panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation and cladding panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
'Social assistance' good news for more than 4,000 chronically ill patients
According to the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, 4 thousand 300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the social assistance program to be launched for poor citizens and their families struggling with chronic diseases in the first phase.
The Ministry, which plans to provide patients with a monthly support of two-thirds of the minimum wage through the assistance program, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information received, the details and application principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases", which began its work some time ago by the instruction of the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, became known.
The social assistance program, which was launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens struggling with chronic diseases and experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, is the first of its kind in the world.
The Ministry, which has completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, will provide not only cash but also regular psychosocial support to families through the social assistance program.
Thus, it is aimed that poor citizens with chronic diseases and their families who continue their treatment processes at home are not left alone both financially and spiritually.
According to studies, in the first phase, poor citizens struggling with tuberculosis disease and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by the measles virus, will be provided regular psychosocial and cash support under the new social assistance program.
In the later stages of the program, other poor citizens struggling with rare and risky diseases will be covered by the program.
In addition to the support, which is planned to be paid at a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, an additional payment will also be made to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical self-care, are bedridden or whose home living conditions need to be improved.
In order to qualify for support, the household's monthly income per person must be less than two thirds of the net monthly minimum wage.
In addition, citizens who are SSPE patients must have a health board report organized according to the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on the Measure of Independence, Classification and Health Board Reports to be Given to the Disabled".
Survey reveals that more than 1 in 5 U.S. airline passengers carries banned items
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who had unknowingly carried prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they later realized that they had accidentally traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, a jet charter service, also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the participants who admitted to knowingly trying to fly something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, while less than 15 percent were members of generation X.
The most common items intentionally taken from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly bringing sharp objects through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also admitted knowingly bringing illicit drugs on board.
The firm said it was conducting a nationwide survey of passengers to find out how many airport security personnel had inadvertently brought in contraband and how many had done so knowingly.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to knowingly or unknowingly smuggle contraband through security are the ones who fly the most.
However, as the firm points out, TSA regulations are a bit convoluted and confusing.
People often aren't sure what fluids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of drugs seized by the TSA turned out to be illicit liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating the books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international ones.
China welcomed the US statements
At a press conference in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Tillerson's statements about the Pyongyang government were important: "Regime change, regime collapse, rapid reunification of the peninsula, and we are not looking for excuses to send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Tillerson reiterated the Washington administration's principles on the North Korea issue and hoped the US would implement these principles effectively and in a policy focused on concrete results.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priority, Wang said that they expect the parties to find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, stressing that Beijing has long insisted on the denuclearization of the peninsula, the protection of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and negotiation.
Pruitt, the head of the EPA, has given up on delaying Obama-era emissions-reduction laws.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chairman Scott Pruitt reversed an earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws that reduced emissions of air pollutants that cause smog.
Pruitt represented change in that his organization was more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past administrations.
He made no mention of a legal challenge to his former position in a federal appeals court.
What's at stake is that states start meeting the October 1 deadline for 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, had long served as a reliable ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt change is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's agenda to roll back regulation.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay an Obama administration law requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that the rollback of the ozone standards only strengthened the EPA's commitment to work with states to meet the new standards in a timely manner and through complex processes.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said, "Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for rulings, waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and agreed to settle the dispute to set timelines for a decision".
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us".
Still, the EPA statement noted that Pruitt could use his "delay power and all other legally available authority" one more time at some point to ensure that regulations are "supported by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A parliamentary bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is leading a coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The EPA's reversal following our lawsuits is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the dirty smoke pouring into their communities".
New York was joined in the lawsuit by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when general pollutants are released into the atmosphere by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that respond to sunlight.
The resulting foul smoke can cause severe respiratory problems in susceptible people and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise reversal.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said: "It's disturbing that it took so much pressure to get this common-sense step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe".
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological struggle to curry favor with polluters and special interests".
Inflation in single digits
Turkey, which recorded the biggest increase in exports in 6 years in July, reduced unemployment from 13 percent in January to 10.5 percent in April and raised the economic confidence index to a 3.5 year high, reduced inflation to a single digit.
According to the data announced yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose by 0.15 percent in July, while the annual inflation fell to 9.79 percent for the first time since January.
As for the main spending groups, in July, the highest increase on a monthly basis was seen in the restaurant and hotel group with 1.75%, while the group with the largest decrease was clothing and footwear with 3.51%.
On an annual basis, the highest increase was in the transportation group with 15.24 percent.
Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu, who pointed out that inflation decreased to a single digit in July, parallel to expectations, said, "The moderate course of inflation is influenced by the decline in food and clothing prices".
But contrary to the headline, the core indicators are up from the previous month.
"We do not expect a relaxation of the central bank's tough stance", he said.
Despite the decline in headline inflation, core inflation indicators increased.
The B index of the special comprehensive TÜFE indicators closely monitored by the Central Bank rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
Kapital FX Research Assistant Director Enver Erkan stated that inflation may close the year at 9.3 percent, "Inflation may fluctuate until December and fall to one household in December".
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity as early as the first months of 2018", he explained.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will end the year in single digits.
The Fed's tightening will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We'll finalize the reforms at the next Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are happy that inflation has dropped to single digits, but it needs to become permanent.
In order to combat inflation, it is necessary to increase supply as well as reduce food price volatility.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: In the coming months, annual inflation may show some upward trend due to the base effect, but from the first months of 2018, the decline in inflation will become apparent.
We expect annual inflation to fall further.
I wish Fenerbahce success in their next matches.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said that his team's performance in the second half of the 1-1 draw with Fenerbahçe in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round rematch was not enough to qualify.
Speaking at the press conference after the match, Foda stated that Fenerbahçe is a top-level team, "We could not use the wings in the first half".
We tied the game in the second half.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
It's the little things in the game that count.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next matches".
Foda stated that they felt very well during their stay in Turkey and were happy with the hospitality they received.
Fernando is in Istanbul.
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, with whom Galatasaray Club has started transfer negotiations, has arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer arrived at Atatürk Airport and was greeted enthusiastically by fans.
Fernando left the airport to the cheers and affection of the yellow and red fans, who were waiting for him in a special vehicle under security measures.
Thirty-year-old Fernando, who started his career with Brazil's Vila Nova and played for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, plays in midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow and red team after passing a medical examination.
Galatasaray, which continues the transfer work, has reached an agreement with Manchester City for 5 million 250 thousand Euros for Fernando, who has been trying to join his squad for a long time.
Flash from the U.S. move on Raqqa:
Speaking to the Pentagon via video conference from Baghdad, Colonel Dillon said that the Raqqa Internal Security Force (RIGG), trained by the coalition, has begun to deploy in areas cleared of Daesh in the city.
"The Raqqa Internal Security Force, composed mostly of Arabs and local anti-Daesh volunteers, continues to maintain order in the cleared areas of the city and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning", Dillon said.
This week, 230 more people have completed their training and joined the group, Dillon said, adding that "the current strength is 850".
Dillon stated that the group was given basic weapons training by the coalition, as well as training in first aid, armed conflict, screening, and checkpoint operations.
Dillon said the interest in the Raqqa Internal Security Force is intense and the coalition will continue to screen applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main backbone of the PYD/PKK, in the recapture of Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization had appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammed as the co-chair of the Raqqa civil administration council.
It is claimed that the military force in Raqqa will include members of the PKK/PYD.
Dillon also announced that the U.S.-led coalition had collected heavy weapons from an opposition group called Shuhada al-Qaryatayn (Shuhouk) in the al-Tanf camp in southern Syria, which they cut off support for last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhouk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small arms and light vehicles were allowed to remain with them", Dillon said.
The U.S. announced last week that it was withdrawing support from Shuhouk because it was patrolling outside the de-confliction zones it agreed with Russia and was engaged in activities unrelated to the fight against ISIS.
The group wants to fight against the regime of Bashar al-Assad as well as Daesh.
According to leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for his border wall.
Notes of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked by the Washington Post.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump pressed him not to say publicly that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States scolded the president of Mexico for publicly throwing a ball against the wall and reportedly said, "You can't tell the press that".
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States, promising Mexico he would pay for the project.
Notes have also been released of his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which sparked a heated dialogue.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the U.S. agreement to take refugees to Australia was a "farce", "rotten" and "stupid", and that the Obama administration's deal would make itself look "foolish" after he proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended his speech by telling Mr. Turnbull, "That was the most unpleasant speech I've had all day".
Relatives of the patient broke the doctor's nose.
Doctors and employees of Turkey's Higher Specialized Education and Research Hospital left work briefly yesterday morning in response to the beating of a doctor colleague by the patient's relatives.
A large crowd gathered in front of the hospital's main entrance, carrying placards that read "No to violence in health".
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, Head of the Hospital's Pediatric Cardiology Clinic, said, "The slogan 'No to violence in health' seems to me to be insufficient and even a party slogan".
Violence has no place in healthcare.
"If it goes on like this, this nation will soon find itself without a health group to serve it".
The health workers' action was supported by Dr. Kamil Turkmen, Ankara Provincial Health Director, Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, General Secretary of Ankara First District Public Hospitals, Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç, Chief Physician of the Turkish Higher Specialized Education and Research Hospital, and patients' relatives in the hospital garden.
Paç condemned the incident and said:
Unfortunately, violence against healthcare workers is on the rise.
An example of this occurred last night when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient's relative.
Although our state, our ministry and our governorate are taking all possible measures to end these incidents as soon as possible, we demand that our people's sensitivity in this matter also increase.
I condemn the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and my medical staff.
Odabaş pointed out that society needs to be aware of violence in health, "Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we experience from time to time".
"We will also take our own precautions, but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health worker", he said.
Turkmen also stated that the judicial process regarding the incident has begun, "Our laws regarding violence in health have been effective enough".
It's practiced at all levels of government.
Police are working on it now.
In the past, they've always sat vacant, but now it's a straightforward public trial, and the state appoints an attorney, prosecutes the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishment for this", he said.
After the explanations, the workers went back to work.
The incident allegedly occurred around 5:45 p.m. the day before.
Relatives of the patient who died in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery.
Police were called to the hospital as Özbek was being escorted away by doctors and assistants.
While Özbek's nose was broken, the attackers were detained.
A doctor who witnessed the incident said:
When our friend went to inform the relatives of a patient who had died, the relatives blamed our friend and us and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
There was a security barrier between us for 15 or 20 minutes.
If the patient's family had breached that firewall, much worse things would have happened.
In Gaziantep, a heavy blow was dealt to Daesh: 102 sacks...
According to the information received, within the scope of the investigation being conducted by the Gaziantep Public Prosecutor's Office, the Gaziantep Security Directorate Anti-Terrorism Branch Directorate seized 5,100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate in 102 sacks used in making explosives.

The suspects were arrested by the Sulh Criminal Magistrate.
The raid by the YPG in Syria...
The United States intervened .
According to information obtained by AA from local sources, YPG terrorists, with the military support of the United States, entered the northern countryside of Raqqa to fight the terrorist organization DEAŞ and looted the homes of residents of Tel Semin.
The reaction of the civilians, whose homes were looted and confiscated, turned into a confrontation with the terrorist organization.
In response, U.S. forces in the area entered the town in armored vehicles.
Armored Cougar MRAPs, personnel carriers, and Husky mine-detection vehicles were seen forming a buffer zone in the town.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Raqqa, which is under fire as part of the anti-Daesh operation, to enter the cities under its control.
Yesterday, a local activist network called "Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently" announced that 121 civilians were killed by ISIS shelling in July alone.
Don 't put off till tomorrow the quarrels of this old world
Delayed perception of the realities of the country and the world can lead not only to ordinary people but also to countries being dragged into crises.
One of the reasons for the delayed perception of the world realities by the backward East, which we describe as "Orientalism", may be that the reflection of these realities on the geographies of the East is blocked by certain focuses or announced in a surreal way.
Don Quixote and Oblomov The delayed or absent perception of reality and change has also been the subject of the literary world.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is about a madman who still thinks he's a knight in a time when the bourgeoisie is beginning to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is the legacy of a lazy man who thought that when he ignored reality, everything could go on as before.
China, for example, was open to the world and dominated the seas until the end of the 15th century, when a conservative dynasty took over.
It lasted until the execution of the captains of the boats that left the territorial waters of China.
We Turks, who have one foot, eye and ear in the West and the other foot, eye and ear in the East, have experienced constant dilemmas in perceiving reality and change, starting with the Ottomans.
Old and new A part of us tried to carry yesterday into today, to understand today with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think yesterday was tomorrow.
Some of us have been able to move as quickly as think tanks in the developed world in perceiving both domestic and global realities and change.
This has been a constant source of conflict and tension.
The encounters between the madrasa and the university, the Janissary and the modern army, faith and doubt, led to a dualism of dramatic content.
Progressivism is obsolete. Worse, it has not been accepted that positions that were new and progressive at one time will become obsolete and backward at a certain time.
Yesterday's progressives, after a period of time, began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", and those who tried to interpret the conditions of the country and the world in accordance with the current reality, "Traitors".
The most important lesson is that in the Ottoman Empire, those who perceived the realities of the country and the world belatedly dominated the thought and state life, eventually the empire disintegrated, collapsed and the people became poor.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past imparted to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Because this lesson has been absorbed so well, we have been able to be a model country of this geography that has managed to preserve its unity, integrity, stability in peace from World War I until today.
A different approach If we are to survive the process of global change, we need to leave behind the memories and adapt to the realities.
In other words, it will do no one any good to bring up the senseless encampments and blood feuds that crippled our democracy in the past.
Moreover, in today's world, the smallest mistakes can lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography is the Middle East, where we are.

Turkish wind.
Global giants who trust in Turkey's future fought tooth and nail in the wind farm tender held yesterday.
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources has set a new world record in the tender for the national energy transition by reducing external dependence.
The tender will lower Turkey's energy costs and pave the way for a $1 billion investment and nearly 4,000 jobs.
By the beginning of 2019, domestically produced wind turbines will be included in the system.
Eight consortiums, including giants from the US, China, Germany and Denmark, participated in the renewable resource areas (YEKA) wind farm license tender opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
In the auction, the financial bid envelopes were first opened in order to identify the 5 bidders who made the lowest bid.
After the first bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19 per kilowatt hour.
The open subtraction range is set to 0.01 cents.
After the tender was launched, the joint venture groups Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the open reduction.
Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the open subtraction.
MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon are the last two after the Nordex consortium also withdrew.
MingYang-First Construction has had 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy consortium has never used a break.
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak: Today is a record day for Turkey.
Open subtraction went on for 30 laps.
The winner of the intense competition between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid at $3.48 cents/kWh.
While the consortium bid $3.49 cents/kilowatt hour in the tender, it reduced its bid to $3.48 at the request of the tender commission headed by Deputy Undersecretary Alparslan Bayraktar.
With the result of the two-hour YEKA tender, Turkey has achieved a world record.
At $3.48 per kilowatt-hour, the bid was the lowest in the world.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84/kilowatt-hour.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference after the conclusion of the tender, stated that the winning of the competition by the German company Siemens is an important message to the region and the world.
Our goals are big.
Today's result shows how firmly the economy and the energy market are moving into the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I was very proud to show with this tender that Turkey is one of the most reliable investment countries in the region and the world.
"In this picture, which all of Turkey, 80 million of us, will be proud of, the greatest contribution belongs to our President, who has brought Turkey to this point in his 15 years in power and leadership", he said.
Expressing that they have started a new era with an open, transparent and comparable competition tender, Albayrak said: "One of the most important steps of this is that the purchase cost per kilowatt hour with domestic contribution in the wind until yesterday was 10.3 dollars / cent, a historic record of 3.48 dollars / cent, a world record price".
I'm proud of it, for my people, for my country.
Minister Albayrak stated that they aim to commission the first domestically produced solar energy panels before the end of 2018 and said, "I hope that by the beginning of 2019, we will include our domestically produced wind turbines in the system".
The turbines will be installed at five designated sites.
The winner of the competition will receive a total installed capacity of one thousand megawatts with the condition of installing at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these five regions.
The total investment by the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon group will be over 1 billion dollars.
With the commissioning of local wind farms, at least 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year and the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million homes will be met from the wind.
The wind farms will also reduce CO2 emissions by an average of 1.5 million tonnes per year.
The winning company will build a factory with an investment of over 100 million dollars.
The factory will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will carry out R&D work for 10 years in a total of 5 areas, at least three of which are wing, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox.
With an annual R&D budget of $5 million, it will employ 50 technicians, 80 percent of whom will be local engineers.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license is for 30 years.
Kazım Türker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Türkerler İnşaat, which is part of the consortium that won the tender, said that the domestic production in the project will be around 64 percent, 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad, "We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources, and the rest from domestic banks".
Türker stated that the tender reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, President of Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said: "It was a tender that will reduce Turkey's dependence on the outside by another thousand megawatts".
"We are pleased with the result", he said.
SIemens Gamesa Turkey Senior Manager Hakan Yıldırım stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years and said, "We will do our best to reduce the electricity unit cost".
The indigenous content of the wind turbines to be produced at the factory will be at least 65 percent.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be domestic (at least 5,200 parts).
Each of the 5 regions will have a minimum of 50 MW and a total of 1000 MW.
Employment opportunity for 3,750 people 10 years of R&amp;D obligation 5 million dollars money to be allocated to R&amp;D activities every year
Production of 300 to 450 indigenous wind turbines of at least 2.3 MWe capacity.
Investment of over 1 billion dollars Factory investment of over 100 million dollars Production capacity of 400 MW/year wind turbine per year.
Production of electricity to meet the needs of approximately 1.1 million households Production of at least 3 billion kWh of electricity per year Average reduction of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists revive racist lynching to call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury plowed through a crowd of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rattled toward the little Ford Bridge in Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, reached the bridge, a group of armed white men stepped forward to block its path.
The gang leader, a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit, took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants trembled in fear.
"We want that shit, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams pierced the darkness as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene of June 22nd is only a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around "Roger's" neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights advocates have returned to Ford's Bridge in Moore to re-enact the 1946 lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan.
So far, no one has been charged in connection with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "It's unbelievable that in all these years not one person has been arrested, even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are".
"It's a stain on history but a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong civil rights advocate.
For him, this reenactment is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice is never righted.
He said, "We want prosecution, we want results, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first".
"We cannot have healing and reconciliation until we have justice".
The coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynching in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected in the lynching.
But not one of them was ever investigated.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights advocates say the twin motivations of lynchings have always been well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
A high court ruling in April 1946 had allowed Georgia's black citizens to vote for the first time in a primary election later that summer.
According to the FBI, around the same time as the election, black business associate Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight, apparently over a woman.
Brooks stated that the rumor in town was that Hester was sleeping with Dorothy, Malcolm's wife, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins went to jail with Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove away from the prison, they came to the Ford Bridge in Moore and a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It appears that Harrison arranged and ordered the murders".
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement who not only participated in the murder but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks was more succinct.
He said, "It was a voting rights massacre".
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'This is what will happen to you if you register and vote.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Ford Bridge lynchings in Moore.
Her performance is nuanced, compelling, and rooted in a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it brings out the ugliness in all of us".
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or what's going on with me".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day about 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) crowded into a room and listened as Greene eagerly outlined the well-rehearsed play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
For years, he's played President Klansman, but he says it's never been easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because this isn't me".
"But I think it's important to keep that history alive because we don't want to go back to that time".
Across the room, the actors playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were rehearsing their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling at and pushing Hester, who is furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said get the fuck off my property!"
He's responding to the Rascona.
There's a thump.
And then everyone (at least the black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene gets the most laughs.
Rascona said, "What?"
He was nervous, he was surprised.
Was I too harsh?
"No", said Greene with a chuckle.
"I just don't think white people said dick back then".
One of the black players said, "Yes", and jokingly threw rocks.
"You have to press the R".
So the energy in the room changes and a kind of intimacy replaces the uneasiness.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the game but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time Rascona says the N-word, sharp and emphatic.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
The reanimation ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming and gunfire and then silence.
A woman dressed in black funeral attire stands over the bodies of the actors and recites Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy "Strange Fruit".
His voice breaks at every other word.
A hundred yards back, an average crowd of four dozen is wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple flew in from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, most of them from up the road.
They all endured the oppressive humidity of Georgia for nearly eight hours as Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolms and the Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders had remained anecdotal, but now standing in the same spot as the lynching means the air feels cursed.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children squat on their hands, grasping the fake blood and motionless bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead", murmurs a little boy, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and it's over.
The actors throw the noose and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in the suit who plays the Klansman president.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his co-stars and tears roll down his cheeks as the emotional toll of the performance finally catches up with him.
One of the women whispers, "It's okay".
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta and a black couple have a passionate conversation about revitalization.
Denise Duplinski struggles to find the words to describe how the performance made her feel.
He said, "To hear these horrible, awful words and these actions... coming from people who look like you, and they're doing it because they look like you".
"What that does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on", he added, "and they're just called police shootings now".
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention as he eats dinner at his desk and recounts his civil rights memories.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said: "The reenactment is inspiring in a way because it describes what we endured, but it is also instructive".
"Like, if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not examine their past, those who do not know their past, are condemned to repeat it".

Special website from AK Party to congress
By the AK Party, 6.
A website "akkongreler.com" has been set up for the regular Congress process.
On the website, the party organization has placed brochures, materials and visuals to be used in this process.
In the 'Communication strategy' section of the site, the rules to be followed during the congress are listed under 14 headings.
In a message posted on his website, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and AK Party General Secretary Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned the organization's members to respect the party's institutional identity during the congress process.
In his message, Erdoğan said, "We are now entering a new breakthrough period".
We must renew and refresh in order to achieve the 2023 targets with more solid steps.
"We must continue to work hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder tomorrow as we did yesterday", he said.
In order to revive the business, Pearson cut another 3,000 jobs, cut its profit margin.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its interim profit margin by 72 percent as it embarks on another restructuring program to cope with the pressures facing the business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the layoffs, which will mostly come in late 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan in May that would save a further £300 million (US$394 million) by attempting to revive the business that was rapidly shifting to digital learning through a third cost-cutting programme.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in its outlook for this year after reporting core sales of 2.05 billion pounds in the first half, up 1 percent.
Text 2 led to death again!
According to the preliminary report of the Coroner's Office, the preliminary findings of Hakan's autopsy report indicate that his death was a suicide.
A thorough examination of the child's body revealed no signs of physical abuse.
Cause of death was asphyxiation from the elastic bandage around his neck.
It was also determined that the cloth her family identified as a bandage was the same elastic bandage used to bandage the wounds.
According to Muslim Saryar's report from Gazete Habertürk, after the detailed report on the child's death was prepared, it was learned that the report stating that the incident was a suicide would be sent to the Büyükçekmece Republic Prosecutor's Office, which is conducting the investigation.
While the police are investigating the boy's suicide in detail, they are also examining his computer, which was confiscated after the incident.
The police will also take statements from Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that the information obtained from the computer of Hakan, whom his relatives call "cleaned", can be used to reach third parties or a gang.
The police are considering the possibility that a gang drove Hakan to suicide.
The certainty of Hakan's suicide turned his eyes to the violent Text 2.
Metin2, which was banned last year by the Antalya Governor's Office for children under the age of 15 for causing addiction and violence in children, came up again in 2009 with the murder of 13-year-old "minor hacker" Metin Kang.
In order to play Text2, which was designed in Korea in 2005, you have to go to the site and register as a member.
Players try to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
And while they're doing that, there's wars, there's more violence.
The play depicts warfare involving sharp weapons, such as spears, swords, maces, and axes, as well as people being torn apart by wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to gain power.
The family who buried their children the next day after the incident that took place on July 25 in the house on Köknar Street in Esenyurt's İstiklal neighborhood maintained the murder claim.
Her father, Mehmet Ekinci, said: "His whole dream was to become a doctor, we don't think he could harm himself or anyone else because of the game".
That's how he was found, son.
We certainly don't think that our son would hurt himself or others or commit suicide because of an online game.
We knew you were playing this game.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say he got a little bored and took himself out of the game.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one is allowed to enter or leave the building".
My child is said to enter the house at a certain hour.
None of them hold together.
When her brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when his body was found, there were two chairs next to the computer".
Ilker KARAS: He may have joined a gang
Parents generally don't pay attention to that.
They're like, "I want my kid home no matter what".
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a borrowing and lending situation, or swearing.
Or maybe he invited someone from the game over, and they had a falling out.
He may have been affected by problems he had with other people he interacted with through the game rather than directly from it.
It's possible that the child thought the game's visuals, the set-up, were real.
The trauma that drove him to suicide could be related to the blackmail.
If the child is faced with the situation of complaining to the family, there is also the possibility of depression because he can not solve this problem.
He couldn't have killed himself because of the game itself.
There's also the possibility that the kid's involved with a gang.
He might be mixed up with the gang.
There's no way the kid could have done this on his own.
Information systems consultant Füsun NEBİL: Parents should know the interaction of their children
We can't say games are harmful.
Research also shows that play is beneficial for children's development.
The key here is for parents to pay attention to what their children are playing and how they interact with gamers online.
Parents need to know what kind of content is harmful to children and take appropriate precautions.
In Turkey, there are only 2 children in 5 years who are said to have died because of the game.
Which means it's not just video games that can cause a child to take their life.
I wonder what drove this kid to it.
That's what we have to find out.
You have to look at the sociology and the psychology around the child.
Eight-month returns on the Istanbul stock exchange were 50 percent.
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend that began in December 2016 in July and carried its rise to the 8th month in a row.
Thus, the index gained 45.3 percent in this period, while recording an increase of 8 consecutive months for the first time since July 2007.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the world's major stock exchanges, including Germany, the US, the UK and Japan, with its performance since the beginning of the year, did not leave the lead in terms of returns in July.
The BIST 100 index, which ended July with a rise of 7.06 percent, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the United States with a rise of 2.54 percent and the FTSE 100 index in the United Kingdom with a rise of 0.81 percent.
The DAX index in Germany and the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with losses.
As of the January-July period, the BIST 100 index has outperformed both major world stock exchanges and emerging market stock indices.
This year, the BIST 100 gained 37.6 percent, the Dow Jones gained 10.76 percent, the DAX gained 5.55 percent, the Nikkei gained 4.55 percent, and the FTSE 100 gained 3.21 percent.
The MSCI EM index, an indicator of emerging market equities, returned 23 percent.
Looking at the historical course of the BIST 100 index, it has shown similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last gained value for eight consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, recorded a 38.3 percent increase in this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index had completed 8 consecutive months of gains between August 1996 and March 1997, and 9 consecutive months of gains between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Yatırım Research Manager Eren Can Umut told Anadolu Agency that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months and has exceeded 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
Umut pointed out that the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index recorded a 23 percent rise, stating that even if we look at these rates alone, there is a positive differentiation:
The flow of funds to developing countries has continued since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds seeking higher returns prefer countries with higher interest rates.
This is already having a positive impact on domestic markets.
Of course, on a global scale, the appetite for risk is also quite high.
This makes stock indices, which have the status of risky assets, popular.
In the U.S., we see new record highs being tested almost every week as the S&P 500 index has risen nearly 11 percent since Christmas.
Umut stressed that the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) 3 percent hike forecast at the beginning of the year put markets under stress, but the Fed's verbal guidance policy eliminated the uncertainty quite well, noting that there is a market that is insensitive to the Fed's interest rate hike.
Umut stated that inflation in the US is not yet at the desired level, and the expectations that the Fed will not be hasty in raising interest rates and will avoid radical moves are also very influential in current pricing.
Not being able to cancel the healthcare reform known as "Obamacare" by US President Donald Trump has strengthened the perception that he will not be able to fulfill his promises of expansionary fiscal policies.
Umut pointed out that 2016 was a year of many negatives for Turkey's markets and said that the negative divergence and oversold BIST 100 index was in an effort to close the gap with its peers.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with the flow of domestically sourced news, Umut noted that the current outlook can be interpreted more as an increase in risk appetite abroad and a desire to close the gap between domestic markets and similar ones.
Umut stated that he technically tracked some profit selling in the BIST 100 index, which tested new records with levels of 108.600, noting:
Especially the 109,500-110,000 area is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for profit-taking to occur as it approaches these levels.
In the short term, we think there needs to be a new local or global narrative for valuations above 110,000.
For now, a breakdown of the 107,500 support could trigger profit selling.
In this case, even though we're tracking the intermediate support at 107,000, I think we can see a loosening to the 106,000-105,500 area.
In particular, a break of the support at 105.500 could trigger a pullback to 104.300, which is Fibo 50% of the move from 100,000 to 108.600.
Stating that the decisions of both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be in the focus of the global market, Umut said that the expectations for the Fed are already clear, but the possibility of the balance sheet reduction program triggering the strengthening in the US dollar may trigger the strengthening in the US dollar.
Umut noted that this could trigger short-term profit selling in developing country (DC) stock indexes, which are in the shadow of overbought conditions. "What is important is what the ECB will say".
Following the July meeting of the monetary policy board, ECB President Mario Draghi stated that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, and this rhetoric led the euro/dollar exchange rate to rise above 1.1700 levels.
Thus, announcements that the €60 billion per month asset purchase programme will be reduced or terminated will mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative pricing may occur on behalf of the markets of countries with high current account deficits and access to foreign funds such as Turkey".
Erol Gürcan, Director of Gedik Yatırım Investment Advisory, stated that after Trump was elected president in the United States in November 2016, there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets.
Gürcan stated that it is possible to say that the main element that triggered this rally movement was developments that increase global growth expectations, primarily Trump's promises of tax cuts:
The Istanbul Stock Exchange also took the lead in the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained highly discounted compared to similar emerging market countries in recent years, it is worth noting that steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a significant role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), which became active as of March, has had a serious impact on the rise observed so far in the index.
In the rest of the year, positive developments were reflected significantly in pricing and KGF, which had an important role in this rise, gradually reached saturation, Gürcan said.
Gürcan noted that developments such as the 180-day action plan, which has been eagerly awaited for some time, the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the introduction of regulations to support company profits, and the possible tax reduction that has come up in the near future can make a positive contribution in this sense.
Gürcan stressed that the fact that the central banks of major developed countries such as the Fed, ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will tighten their current expansionary monetary policy stance, albeit gradually, is also among the critical risk factors for developing countries.
Gürcan said that the 104.150-104.600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year, is very critical in the possible correction movements in the index in the coming period.
Gürcan stated that if the current uptrend is maintained and the current historical peak level of 108.605 resistance is broken, the index may rise to the range of 110.000-112.000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier was killed in suicide attack
Officials say a suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said in a statement that five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabakh area of the city.
The bombing is the latest violence in Afghanistan this month after more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said the blast on Thursday evening was an attack by a "person-guided improvised explosive device" on a joint patrol with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the wounded were in good condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram air base.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed at least 1,662 civilian deaths, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the volatile security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
After the lawsuits, the EPA stopped delaying the clean air rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed itself a day after 15 states sued the agency over its decision to delay an Obama-era law requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions.
Late Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to move forward with the "Ozone Resolutions of 2015", saying the organization had demonstrated its commitment to working with the states.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue and being responsive to our state partners".
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay for one year until October 2018 the ozone decisions, which measure current smog pollution in various parts of the country and decide where cuts must be made to meet more stringent air quality standards.
Fifteen predominantly Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump continues to seek to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump says is to revive economic growth.
But those efforts drew a backlash from Democrats and conservation groups worried about the public health effects of more emissions.
Breathing ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma", says the EPA website.
The woods have spoken...
It's time for the stopper and the wing transfer!
Fikret Orman, president of Beşiktaş, spoke to Bein Sports about the transfer of the Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stopper.
Fikret Orman said the following...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
We're not looking for a lot of transfers. We're looking for touchdowns.
Now we're going to do a stopper and a wing transfer.
We've got Champions League games coming up, hopefully a good draw.
We're going to have to do a forced wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it's within our budget, we'll transfer it. If not, we won't.
I can't give you any information until we're clear about the lens.
We're a publicly traded company.
The reward of patience is peace.
The ISIS threat is only for August 30th, not for the festival?
Reactions continue after the Ankara Governor's Office banned all public events, including concerts, sit-ins, commemorative meetings and the like throughout August on the grounds of "ISIS threat".
While the governor's decision prohibits "all public events", the 7th of May in Ankara was banned.
The International Grand Ankara Festival is going on.
CHP Group Deputy Chairman and Ankara MP Levent Gök said in a statement to SÖZCÜ, "There can be no question of August 30 being affected by the bans".
He's seriously confused.
Even the governor's office is on the fence as to what action to take...
It's the state's job to create spaces where holidays are celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said "The whole of Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations do not have a security problem".
Aylin Nazlıaka, an independent MP from Ankara, moved the ban to the Parliament.
Nazlıaka suggested that the Prime Minister should answer and said, "Doesn't this ban clearly reveal the AKP's hostility to the republic and Atatürk?
"I learned from Edwina herself that I had been deceived"
Demet Şener, whose divorce case with İbrahim Kutluay is ongoing, was in Nişantaşı with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the day before.
Sener, who sued Edwina Sponza for moral damages for allegedly destroying her home, presented photographs of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence in court.
Sponza, a socialite, filed a complaint against Şener, saying, "Demet illegally obtained my private photos".
"I did not know how to swear"
After this latest development, Şener, who met with his lawyer at Nişantaşı Delicatessen, left the place when he saw the journalists.
When reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, a very cheerful Şener laughed and said, "Allah Allah, I must have broken into your house and taken them".
Aslı Hatemi also said about Sponza's complaint, "There is such a complaint, but its content is not true".
He said, "We have everything. We've submitted it to the court".
Şener said that journalists said, "Lately, everyone knew about your wife's affair with Sponza".
"How could you not know?" he asked in surprise.
What's that?
How's that?
"I swear I didn't know", Şener said. "Should I believe my husband looking me in the eye or the gossip of the world?"
When pressed by the journalists, Şener said, "No". He continued: "No, of course I heard it the first time".
But I didn't believe in any of that.
Everything was normal, everything was in place, there was nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, I learned everything when you sent it to me, so it's new...
Şener, who answered "Yes" to the question "Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?", confused the court by claiming that Sponza himself sent him the photos and correspondence he presented to the court.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with İbrahim Kutluay was staged.
Beşiktaş will sign the contract with Negredo tomorrow.
Beşiktaş Club will officially sign Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
A signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, whose transfer has been agreed in principle by Beşiktaş and Valencia Club of Spain.
The signing ceremony, which will be attended by club president Fikret Orman, will take place at noon.
Meanwhile, the Spanish footballer will undergo a medical tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatari Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani expressed his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honesty and support".
I convey the greetings of the Emir of Qatar to my brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Qatari economy has proven resilient.
While the economies of many countries have been adversely affected, ours has remained robust.
We must work hard to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke the embargo against us in a matter of hours, largely thanks to Turkey.
We're not short of anything right now.
Our natural resources, our natural gas exports are a big boost to Qatar's economy.
Thanks to Turkey, we have not been affected by the brutal and illegal blockade imposed on us.
Today, Qatar continues to lead the world in natural gas and LNG production.
"After what happened, we experienced a 30 percent increase in natural gas exports, not a decrease", he said.
Stating that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey and the work in all fields continue, Al Thani said, "The volume of trade between us amounted to 554 million dollars in the first quarter".
Recent decisions have played an important role in this.
Accelerating the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors as a result of Turkish products proving themselves in the Qatari market, investing in many areas is extremely important for us.
"Thank you very much for your constructive attitude toward us", he said.
The cost of the recent disasters is 300 million TL
TSB Chairman Can Akın Çağlar stated that after the flood raid on July 18, 7 thousand damage notifications worth 116 million TL were made to insurance companies, 800 damage notifications worth 12 million liras were received in the Gökova earthquake on July 21, and 22 thousand damage notifications worth 168 million liras were received in the flood and hail in Istanbul on July 27, noting that the cost of the last three events to insurance was 300 million liras.
Çağlar said, "In terms of hull insurance, the damage caused by the hail is around 3,500 liras per vehicle, and the glass damage is around 1,000 liras".
"In the earthquake, the average damage to housing is 6 thousand liras", he said.
Emphasizing that they are making intensive efforts as a sector to compensate for economic losses, Can Akın Çağlar stated that 3 out of every 4 people do not have housing insurance, 1 out of every 2 businesses do not have fire insurance and 2 out of every 3 people do not have casco insurance.
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious damage costs increases every day.
These costs should not be left entirely to the state.
Insurance policies aren't as expensive as they're made out to be, and insurance isn't just an industry that pays out claims; it's also a risk management consultancy.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance coverage is very important for our people and our country.
Can Akın Çağlar, "The general conditions of the hull insurance state that the insured must report their damages within 5 working days, and this period ended yesterday".
"Will the insured be victimized?" he replied, "Although the statute of limitations in the Commercial Code is two years".
"It's also a natural disaster, so the policyholders don't have to panic, no company is going to say, 'I'm not paying.'"
That's how the German media saw the gigantic tender!
In a period of increasing tensions between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens won Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA) tender.
German media announced this development with the words "German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey".
DWelle Türkçe reported that the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender. "The consortium will invest more than 1 billion dollars in the wind farm", he said.
"The tender opened for the creation of a thousand megawatt wind energy capacity has the distinction of being Turkey's first YEKA tender". The number of companies competing in the tender decreased from 8 to 2 today, the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums faced each other, the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrew from the tender when the 30th round began.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the tender, made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The tender was won by the German company Siemens and we can say that this painting is an important message to the region and the world.
When we look at the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make an important contribution to Turkish-German relations.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to announce with this tender that Turkey is at the top of the most reliable investment countries in the region and the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible match
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia met for the first time Thursday in what promises to be one of the most satisfying boxing matches in recent memory for the 147-pound underdog.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
In a unanimous vote Saturday on Showtime, Garcia defeated former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, placing both fighters in the top five of the non-weight watch list.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you".
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN Saturday night at 7:00.
As the duo posed for photographs, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential match between the fighters would be of "perfect size".
Garcia did the "I fucked an old feather" reminder.
"I went high for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm too young for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
He needs to go to lightweight, then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give it to them".
Lomachenko has joined.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas has asked if it should be pay-per-view; it is part of his strategy to set a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer and have Lomachenko fight in a 135-pound opening bout later this year; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell fight for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
Garcia said, "The fight can be on pay-per-view because all the fans want it", and later stated that he was open to whichever network offered the best financial package.
We're the real names.
No other name arouses so much interest.
Whenever they're ready"...
Garcia said he admires Lomachenko as a "tremendous fighter" and may attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko hesitated to lavish praise on Garcia, saying he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey... you asked for the knockout".
Garcia said the focus is on punching power first, then boxing.
Both said they felt the momentum was building for their own encounters.
"This is a fight that must be fought.
No other fight generates this much attention and buzz.
Garcia said, "I'm more than happy to deal with it".
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the best fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight".
Turkish Resti from Russia to America
The White House does not intend to impose sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
And that's because the cost of borrowing has gone up.
Worried that Western investment partners might consider pulling out of the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin accelerated construction of the pipelines in response.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is building the TurkStream pipeline that is planned to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, accelerated construction at Gazprom's request.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom has also "hurriedly" started construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment test released
The latest results of a Swedish assessment of refugees undergoing a new method of medical age assessment concluded that more than 80 percent of those tested were over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national Office of Forensic Medicine and Pharmacy (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after criticism of the Swedish Migration Board's (Migrationsverket) failure to assess the correct age of some refugees who claimed to be underage.
To date, the Migration Board has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the State Agency of Forensic Medicine and Pharmacy has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002 figure) were judged to be 18 or over, and in 25 cases the Bureau of Forensics and Drug Enforcement ruled the subject was "probably 18 and over".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably under 18".
The tests were only performed in cases where the age of the person was in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The high rate of convictions over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the department released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "in which the persons examined were shown to be 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 reported cases, it found that 243 cases clearly stated that they had turned 18 that year.
The medical method of age assessment, which involves taking X-rays of the 20-year-old's teeth and MRI scans of his knee joints, then sending them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has been criticized in some circles.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who has also studied the biological maturity of people who enter puberty earlier or later than normal.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I think that's not the kind of measurement that should be used.
That's a very dubious way to judge biological age.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend".
However, Göransson, of the Medical Examiner's Office, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being mistaken for an adult is small.
The greatest risk is just before age 18, when the risk is about 10 percent".
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque opens for worship today
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 to the architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship today with Friday prayers after restoration work.
District Manager Mürsel Sarı said that the restoration work, which began in June 2013, has been completed and the mosque is ready for opening.
"The restoration work was carried out in two phases".
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
And the second part was environmental regulation.
In the first part, about 16 million liras were spent, and about 11 million liras for environmental regulation.
First, the lead of the wooden dome was opened, after they were renewed, the outer walls were cleaned of dirt, rust from external factors.
Drains have been made to stabilize it.
As we enter the mosque, we see that it is richly decorated.
It's a work with a star motif, and it's very rich in terms of penmanship.
There's a mix of styles here.
"There are also traces of Seljuk, Ottoman and Baroque influences, considering it was built in 1885".
He's got a job.
"The chandelier in the central square of the mosque is German Emperor II".
It was partially malfunctioning, so it was refurbished, cleaned and hung in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
On either side of the mosque are symmetrical wooden cages called salamluk.
We know that they were built by our Great Khan Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we know that he made these with his own hands and assembled them here.
They're still here in their original form.
Sari said that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is expected to attend the opening ceremony of the mosque.
Pantic's claim in Goztepe
Ukrainian media reported that the 25-year-old Serbian, who failed to make the squad at Dinama Kiev, could be loaned to the yellow-and-red club.
Having started his career with Red Star Belgrade, Pantic played for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alavés in Spain.
Pantic signed for Dinamo Kiev in the middle of last season.
The governor of West Virginia has announced he's switching parties.
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced he was switching parties at a rally with President Trump on Thursday night.
Governor Justice said, "Like it or not, the Democrats have abandoned me".
"Today I say to you with much prayer and reflection... today I say to you as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor".
The rally was drowned in cheers.
Justice added, "So tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to Republican".
"If I was the coach, I'd tell you it's time to build a different game".
Mr. Trump had promised to make an important announcement earlier at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and the Democratic nominee, Justice, did not endorse Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the state's only billionaire according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes states that he inherited his father's coal business and owns coal mines in five states.
His net worth is approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Convention released a statement Thursday evening saying, "Gov. Justice's party change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather work to prevent our country from becoming great again".
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, "With control of only 15 governorships and the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message".
I will do what is best for Turkey.
Olympic third, Turkish record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but he came to Turkey for F.Bahçe.
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national jersey...
First European champion, then third in the Olympics...
And now one of Turkey's most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, who competes in the 400-meter hurdles, spoke to SABAH ahead of the championship, which begins today.
When you were young in Cuba, they didn't want you because they didn't like your grades.
You hired a trainer and improved yourself.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Part of me thinks you chose Turkey for the money.
What do you say, huh?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
From that moment on, I drew a line in the sand.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of Fenerbahce.
I got into the national team thanks to Fenerbahce.
They made me an offer for reinforcements.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries when I was younger, but after the opportunities I had in Turkey, I had a lot of success in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Athletics Championships and win a different title.
You cried at the press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey's sponsorship of me, I remember my childhood, when I was thrown out of the Cuban National Team at the age of 23.
And of course, in Turkey, people approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt similar things when the Independence March was played.
I couldn't hold back the tears.
I'm also very grateful to Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I'm very happy to belong to the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs give out.
You said before that you might have a Turkish lover.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
Do you want to share your experience?
The biggest advantage of being with a Turk is calmness...
Compared to Cuban women, I have peace...
Turkish girls take care of their relationships.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You're together all day, does he interfere with your eating, for example?
She eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laugh) I don't really follow a strict diet, but sometimes it interferes with what I eat.
My trainer, Massimo Matrone, often gives me stern warnings about my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How are you with Turkish food, does your girlfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook very well, but my lover cooks better.
(Laughter) Dry beans and rice is my first choice.
I just laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He replaced me with other young men.
We met in Cuba after winning medals for Turkey.
He looked me in the face, pointed at the young athletes around him, and said, "Look, I raised him".
I just laughed at him.
My eyes , my nerves .
I'm curious about your racing glasses.
I just use it for concentration.
As soon as I put on the glasses, I cut myself off from the world and build walls on both sides.
I just focus on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Tokyo 2020?
This is Felix Sanchez.
She won the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2012 London Olympics when she was 35 years old.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, why not.
TURKCELL gives support
Turkcell Deputy General Manager İsmail Bütün said that they believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in London and said, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best way in this championship".
Good luck to all our athletes competing in London.
"We will continue our support for the further development of Turkish athletics and greater achievements for our country", he said.
Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for the doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as Russia's sincere apology over the doping scandal but stressed the time was not right for the country to be readmitted to sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country was right to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were taken from them by force in the competitions".
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF president Coe told reporters, "I think today was a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation".
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted him, having survived so many turbulent days and done everything possible to ensure the federation's reconstruction"...
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had agreed to his readmission criteria.
Coe said, "I think it's a very constructive day, and I think we're moving forward, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that now is not the right time to restore Russia's rights".
"We must do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to separate the clean athletes from the flawed system".
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met many of the criteria for reinstatement.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still working freely.
Don't deny the news of 'tanks for YPG' from the US
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has announced that no tanks have been given to any of the parties fighting in Syria.
Claims that hundreds of trucks loaded with tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
The Embassy issued a statement entitled "Clarification Regarding False Reports in the Press Regarding Trucks Going to Syria", which said:
Over the past few days, there have been a number of false reports in the press falsely claiming that the United States has sent hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. has not provided tanks to any group fighting Daesh in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military assistance, consisting primarily of small arms and ammunition, supports Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) elements within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Syrian Arabs, including the FSA, are fighting to clear Daesh from the region and return to their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be higher than last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut stated that 55 percent of all investments that came last year came after July.
Ermut stated that there was no decrease in investments due to the July 15 FETÖ coup attempt, on the contrary, there was an increase, "Maybe there would have been more increase, ket struck".
Maybe if we didn't have these conditions, if we didn't have some regional developments, we would have seen more of a multiplier effect.
We're more hopeful for next year because of him.
Let's hope for a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
We're already up 11 percent in the first five months, compared to the first five months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more", he said.
"Whether it is global or regional developments, it does not make us worry", Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that normally 75 percent of direct investments until 2010 came from Europe:
That number has dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share went from two percent to seven to eight percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we've been trying to do that, the Gulf states have had some problems of their own.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two important players.
But the problem between these two countries is upsetting us, and it's causing investors to postpone their decisions a little longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, we may be experiencing some delays because of that.
Arda Ermut recalled that some incidents took place in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, reacted clearly and decisively to this situation.
When he spoke to investors in countries experiencing the most severe political crisis, President Erdoğan's reaction was, "Look, problems are between governments, certainly not between peoples".
Secondly, these people came and invested in my country.
They're no different to us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, if they have the slightest problem, they'll come to us and we'll solve it.
"We will definitely not allow them to be victimized", Ermut said, adding that they continue to support all investors.
Ermut said, "We can guarantee that in the coming period".
You'll see that neither German companies, nor investors from countries where we have some political problems in any way, will have any problems.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase investment from these countries.
We think the investment from here will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment climate.
"But we will do our part and do our best to ensure that our investors and the perception of the investment environment are not affected".
TYDTA President Ermut said that after the One Belt One Road strategy, Turkey began to see great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are solved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In the relations with Germany, there is not a single investor who says, 'We had problems because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we are running away.'"
"Currently, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are from German companies", Ermut said.
So almost 10 percent of the companies that we interview from all over the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
The guy's got an investment to grow, or he's got an issue, and we're keeping it open as a project.
"So German companies are actually still an important part of our daily business flow", he said.
Emphasizing that all state institutions should be careful during the periods when perception operations are carried out in Turkey, Ermut said that the issue is sensitive and can be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut stated that the events of the past 2-3 weeks are a good lesson and said:
Investors and politicians always have different agendas.
And we've always seen that economic relations always sort of set the stage for political developments.
Germany will continue to be an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany is also increasing this kind of rhetoric.
I think once they're gone, things will be a little bit better.
In Saudi Arabia in particular, both countries are careful not to make negative statements.
As a result, an investor investing in Turkey is investing in the markets of all surrounding countries.
So there's been a bit of a slowdown, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of uncertainty in the region.
But we're still in discussions with these investors.
My personal view is that investors are waiting for a decision that they can perhaps make more quickly.
We don't have a Saudi investor who says, "I see uncertainty in a negative sense because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm getting out of here".
On the contrary, we still have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who meet with us while they are here on vacation, and we follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut reminded that the international direct investments (IDIs) that came to Turkey last year were 12.3 billion dollars and said, "I think we will definitely surpass it this year.
"But how far we go will be affected by these regional developments, global uncertainties".
Ermut, who hoped that the impact would normally be more, said that it may be a little more limited, pointing out that it went with an increase of 11 percent as of the first 5 months, pointing out that this could be avoided, "Hopefully if there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of the year better than last year".
Pointing out that a significant part of the withdrawn investments will continue to be real estate, Ermut said that new investments can be seen in logistics, health, fintech, information technology, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
Emphasizing that they will announce new investments in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may have an investment announcement in the sense of manufacturing in the near future".
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There could be investments from interested countries", he said.
Operation against 4 wine companies in 9 cities: 55 detained
Istanbul Anti-Smuggling Branch Directorate teams found that the foil coating covering the cork on the products sold by 4 wine companies was kept long and loose and the bandrols were not glued to the bottle, the TAPDK bandrols glued to the coating were collected after the products were sold and marketed by attaching them to newly produced wines.
The police claimed that the state lost 20 million 400 thousand liras in taxes due to the repeated use of banners by the suspects.
Police teams carried out simultaneous operations today at 55 addresses, including factories and warehouses of 4 wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.

Police teams searching a warehouse were filmed removing the caps from wine bottles ready for sale.
Police teams were recorded examining bags full of TAPDK banderole hoods collected from used bottles.
How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris?
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Barcelona, Spain to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
From UEFA, the governing body that oversees the European game, with the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, to Paris Saint-Germain, anything can happen.
Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that they financed Neymar's transfer without suffering huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will command a salary in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France:
Given that the team's money comes from an energy-rich Qatari family, PSG can certainly afford to sign Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on players, but they must balance this with legitimate sources of income, provided they have a direct link to football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that incurred large debts in pursuit of success were effectively cheating and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP began to monitor clubs' losses rather than concentrate on their debts.
The change meant that the model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with potential, spend heavily to improve the team and build a global brand) became a more difficult endeavour.
During the 3-year FFP evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
Despite Platini's dishonorable dismissal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin, is still determined to discourage excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules moving forward".
Although PSG will pay Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount over the duration of the contract for accounting reasons.
Neymar signed a 5-year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown in the annual accounts for the next 5 years as a cost of 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw the heaviest sanctions imposed on Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and ordered to limit its Champions League squad to 21 players instead of the normal 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is wary of clubs that may try to cheat financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to count as legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's earnings from PSG could come through payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar will be an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, and such a move could easily be uncovered by UEFA regulators.
The sanctions imposed on PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant against attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA is not in preventive talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
The latest published accounts show that PSG made a profit of over €10 million on a turnover of €542.4 million in 2015-16.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gifts and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30% after the signing.
Clearly upset by the departure of one of football's greatest players, the Spanish league tried to block Neymar's departure, claiming that PSG had violated FFP.
"This is an open case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's definitive ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose own club is owned by an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being financed by a state.
"It's a consequence of ownership and it's completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play because for a country to have such a big player representing a country can lead to having different methods or different interests.
'Ceiling price' revolt from insurers
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been losing money in the traffic division since 2006.
The sector, which lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, made only 19 million TL profit in 2016.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta are traded on the Istanbul stock exchange.
Speaking at the meeting where TSB's first six-month results of 2017 were evaluated, Çağlar said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, with the implementation of the ceiling premium, they estimated that the loss of the sector would increase to 2.3 billion TL this year, the estimated damage-premium ratio to 125 percent.
Çağlar, who said that the 2015 figure will be reached this year, pointed out that the loss recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profit of other branches, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we are increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy".
"Seventy-five percent of the industry is foreign, and our partners abroad have in a sense financed the bad driver", he said.
The ages went on like this:
We don't expect to make a profit on the traffic, but looking at the last 11 years, we can't show a single year of profit.
He said, "We'll accept that, but we're still hopeful that we can carry that loss in a reasonable environment, along with other policies".
Çağlar said that there are dramatic price increases when the damage in traffic takes away the profitability of other products, "In 2012, there were price increases in traffic insurance of around 30 percent, in 2015 it almost doubled, we recorded the biggest loss in our history".
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, our profit in traffic at the end of 2016 was only 19 million TL", he said.
Çağlar said that they expect the free tariff to be passed next year, "In the free tariff, we will lower the price of the good driver and apply a high price to the bad driver".
"But the Treasury is looking at the overall trend, and the Treasury has the final say on when".
The Undersecretariat of the Treasury, stating that the increase in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a wide section of society, has implemented a maximum premium (ceiling price) since April 12.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance policies to be arranged were determined on the basis of each vehicle group, step and city groups determined by taking into account traffic density and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the "Risky Insured Pool" application was implemented for groups of vehicles with high damage frequency in compulsory traffic insurance.
The premiums and damages related to the pool's motor insurance policies will be shared among the insurance companies.
The premiums of these policyholders will be determined by the Treasury Department.
Çağlar said that with the implementation of the ceiling premium in traffic, the premium production in the first 6 months of 2017 decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and when inflation is taken into account, the discount in traffic policies reached about 30 percent.
Çağlar said that this year traffic will again take profits from other branches, "This loss cannot be sustained with these ceiling prices.
How much more damage can the industry take?"
Çağlar said that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, and that the capital of the sector will be finished in three years when only 2.3 billion TL is lost from traffic.
He said, "We're trying to tell the Treasury what our problem is at this point".
After these developments, Çağlar was asked if foreigners had come to the point of reducing their weight in the Turkish insurance sector, "They have not yet reached that point".
They expect to invest more in Turkey, because in the Netherlands, the average is six policies per person, while in Turkey it's 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place that really needs to grow", he said.
So they haven't given up on this place.
But even though the company makes a decent profit every year, he keeps all the profits and uses them to grow the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 was 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year it was 23.1 billion TL, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
Chaglar said he doesn't expect the industry to finish the year with 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Good news for thousands of chronically ill patients.
The details and application principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases", which began its work some time ago by the instruction of Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, became known.
4 thousand 300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit from the social assistance program for poor citizens and their families in the first phase.
Patients will receive a monthly allowance of two thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also make additional payments to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical self-care, are bedridden, or whose home living conditions need to be improved.
Payments will be made through Social Assistance Cards provided by PTT.
Those who are unable to go for reasons such as geography, illness or disability will be paid at the door.
The programme is also a world first in many respects.
One out of every 10 firms to invest is still German.
Arda Ermut, head of the Turkish Investment Promotion and Support Agency of the Prime Minister's Office, stated that German companies in Turkey are seen as Turkish companies and that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world.
Ermut said, "There is not a single investor in relations with Germany who says, 'We are running away because of this situation.'"
"About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are from German companies", Ermut said.
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"The Germans are an important part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut said that Abraaj Group's partnership with logistics company Netlog is a good example.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed pointed to the economic growth in Turkey and said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey".
Özer, on his way to becoming the last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer, who was given two weeks by the administration to find a club, signed an official contract with Osmanlıspor in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, 4 hours before the end of the transfer, Özer Hurmacı, who signed a contract with the green-black club until 2019, contributed significantly to the team with 5 goals and 4 assists while wearing the uniform in 29 league and 2 cup matches.
The management, who blocked Özer's way back, signed Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday instead.
It's the transfer of the century!
Barcelona announced the transfer of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of €222 million.
The transfer development, which the football public has been following with excitement recently, has been made official.
PSG paid the Catalan club €222 million for the Brazilian, the player's release price.
Neymar became the most expensive transfer in the history of football with this bonus fee.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the French Ligue 1 has announced the signing of Brazilian star Neymar to a five-year contract.
In a statement on the club's website, the 25-year-old Neymar, who became the world's most expensive footballer by being paid 222 million euros in bonservice termination fees, signed a contract to wear the PSG shirt until 30 June 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar stated that he was very happy to wear the shirt of the French national team, "Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and ambitious teams".
The reason I joined this club and my teammates is to win as many trophies as our fans want".
PSG will pay Neymar 45 million euros for each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the French representative over 400 million euros.
The maritime workers' strike ended with a raise.
İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company İZDENİZ A.Ş. and the Turkish Seamen's Union (TDS) affiliated to Türk-İş failed to reach an agreement on the increase clause in the collective agreement.
On July 12th, the workers of IZDENİZ, a member union, went on strike.
The strike, which lasted nearly a month, ended today at 3:00 p.m. after the workers were given a raise.
According to the signed collective labor agreement, the salary of the ground staff of İZDENİZ will be increased by 12 percent.
With the Income Tax exemption obtained after İZDENİZ, which renewed its fleet, was registered in the International Ship Register, the salary increased by 25 percent and the increase rate accepted for the staff with the status of a seaman was 5 percent.
İZDENİZ General Directorate announced that the flights in the inner bay will continue with normal tariffs, Yassıcaada flights will start on Tuesday, and Foça and Urla flights will start from next weekend.
TDS Chairman Hasan Pekdemir stated that they blocked transportation with their 23 days of strikes and said: "The people of Izmir will be relieved".
As a result of the strike, improvements have been made to the rights of our workers on land and at sea.
We gladly leave the table.
An average of 28 percent will go into the pockets of those working at sea and 20 percent on land.
We had friends who worked for minimum wage.
We've also made significant improvements to their salaries.
Nostalgia is niche with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
It's nostalgic for the characters' glory days in the '80s, for the grunge era of the '90s (when brainiacs like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for the year itself, 2001, before it went on to bigger things, starring Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd.
As a cultural product, it's both an abstraction and an embodiment of our Facebook age of perpetual memory.
But as a series, it's kind of out of date.
"First Day of Camp" was an unexpected success, and not just because of its absurdist humor (it featured a story about the origins of a talking box plant, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By concentrating on the main comedy (middle-aged actors playing juvenile horny children), he realized the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.
Now with adults playing adults, "Ten Years Later" is less emotionally based and its parody more random, including a monologue about a perverted stalker movie from the '90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some single-row roller skates, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
A lot of the basic stories are the same.
The soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, still haunted by Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
There's also another insanely treasonous plot involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter) now being perpetrated by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the series are the interludes.
It's especially nice to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd with the mustache from Matt Dillon's "The Bachelor", whose Andy, once the most popular kid at his old school, now looks like an old man.
There may be moments of random madness that fuel this series (such as a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" sequence) until it reaches what I think is its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene has the gang of friends going to see the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans", the film "Blonde Bombshell", and even "GLOW" with its iconography of East versus West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, looks like found TV: a 1980s Romanian cop buddy drama in which two Bucharest police officers fight for truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles are played by Gregor the wolf and Iosef the idealist, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with English dubbing of their dialogue by Channing Tatum (who is also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There's some nice visual comedy. (Police watching chess on TV while Americans watch football)
The celebrity voice cast, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny, makes for a good guessing game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so dedicated to making a clumsy propaganda drama look like reality (including a murderer wearing a Reagan mask) that it often plays exactly like it.
It can't go past six long episodes, and the comedy isn't fast enough or frequent enough.
While Gregor and Iosef were constantly visiting the American embassy, where in the lobby there were always two fat men eating a pile of hamburgers like hungry wolves, "Comrade Detective" could have better fulfilled its propaganda satire if it had been shortened to a narrower length.
His message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn anything into mass-produced food.
The Romanian creators of fiction are not wrong: we do this to our own recent past and even to theirs.
FETO's ancestors are the Kadyanis.
The British government has learned from 50 years of experience that our family is loyal and selfless.
The highest levels of government have acknowledged that this family has a long history of loyalty and service to the British Government.
The British Government must be wise and careful about this seedling that they have planted with their own hands, they must examine everything thoroughly and decide carefully.
When trying to understand FETO, the starting point is the organization of the Hashshashin, but an essential difference is forgotten, that FETO is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and acts with colonial motives.
In my opinion, the 'pioneering movement' that needs to be addressed in this regard are the Qadianis.
In the English eulogy in the introduction, the person who describes himself as 'the sapling planted by the hands of the British Government' is Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiyani, the founder of Qadiyanism.
Born in Qadian, a small town in the Indian state of Punjab, Ghulam Ahmad declared that on "December 1, 1888, Allah commanded him to take the oath of allegiance from his followers and form a separate congregation".
Ghulam Ahmed went a little further, in 1891, he said that according to the revelations and inspirations he received, Isa b. Maryam died a natural death like other prophets, and Allah sent him as the messiah and mahdi awaited by Christians and Muslims.
According to this, the Messiah and the Mahdi awaited by Muslims are the same person, which is Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani.
(Islamic Encyclopaedia, published by TDV)
Ghulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians in India, which came completely under British rule after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, recalls the portrait of Gülen defending Islam against irreligion with the Presidency of the Society for Combating Communism in Erzurum, which was founded with purely sanctifying motives but later revealed to be supported by the CIA.
Like Gülen, Ghulam Ahmed's favorite imperialist idea is that "jihad" is a Muslim's struggle only with himself, and if you can practice your religion freely, there is no dimension of imperialism to fight.
In fact, if you remember, Gülen went a step further and praised the Crusader attacks in a sermon last year, even though the wound of our history is still open.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
For one thing, they won't touch your wife, your daughter.
They won't touch your temple, untouched crusaders!
Apart from the similarity of the theses with FETÖ, such as the idea that the Mahdi and messianism are united in him, the idea that his congregation will be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad only means the struggle with the soul, the way of spreading Qadyanism also took place in the field of education and civil society in general.
The total number of Qadiyanis' centers in the world, where the number of their 'doctors' is said to exceed 2 million, is 1869, and the number of countries where the emergency aid organization "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
There are also 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 printing presses owned by Qadianis in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and about 16,000 mosques worldwide.
When we consider that the "first Muslim scientist" to win the Nobel Prize, Prof. Abdussalam, the "first Muslim actor to win an Oscar", Sir Zaferullah Khan, who served as the President of the United Nations Court of Justice, are also Qadianis, we can see more clearly the depth of the global powers' approval of the Qadianis.
Let it be noted that the 30,000 strong gathering of the Qadiyanis in England last week was also glossed over as a stunt.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that the Qadianis, one of whose slogans was "Love everyone, hate no one", actually meant "love your occupiers/colonizers".
It is possible to trace the origins and motivations of structures such as Hulasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ul Kadri back to the Qadianis, and all of these organizations are in fact supported to corrupt societies in order to serve imperialism and serve colonialism.
"Last wish" came from the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her final days in a Washington, D.C., hospital with pancreatic cancer, expressed a yearning for the coffee-and-chocolate milkshake served at a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put the beverage on dry ice and paid the $123 (U.S.) fee to have it shipped by "express delivery" to the hospital 400 miles [600 km] away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul İnşaat, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put up for sale Dia Mare in Mimaroba and Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalıkavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by Çamoğlu Mimarlık Architects, was developed to take maximum advantage of the sea.
Dia Mare is located on an area of 11 thousand square meters, with a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The rough construction is completely finished and the project will be handed over to the new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has a large number of apartment types ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company, which will commission two new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapı in 2018.
He transferred 753 million to subsidiaries.
Barış Yarkadaş said that in TRT, where 6 thousand 760 staff work, many programs are made outside and exorbitant prices are paid.
CHP deputy, "TRT 2016" again attracted the nation's taxes to AKP companies.
He said, "It's called robbery".
The source that TRT passed on to the subsidiary production companies was revealed with data obtained from official documents.
The official response to CHP Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş's application under the Law on Access to Information has revealed how TRT's resources are being spent.
Yarkadaş said that in TRT, where 6 thousand 760 people work as staff, despite all kinds of technical possibilities, 753 million 500 thousand TL were transferred to subsidiary companies in 2016 through programs made under the name of external production.
The CHP deputy used the expression, "The meaning of this is emphatic".
Barış Yarkadaş, "The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are practically looting TRT".
He said, "Millions are paid for productions that aren't seen or aren't sure if they're being filmed".
Yarkadaş recalled that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the people's taxes, "the institution with 7 thousand staff turned into AKP's barley".
He said, "What did these companies sign up for that 7,000 people couldn't?"
Yarkadaş stated that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was 224.456.182 TL, adding that after taking into account staff salaries and other expenses, the advertising revenue remained negligible.
Comrade, "TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, cannot receive advertising because it is not watched".
Besleme journalists get money from TRT, they make propaganda on behalf of AKP.
"The burden is on the people", he said.
CHP's Yarkadaş continued: "TRT gives 660 million TL annual salary to the staff; but it gives all the work to foreign productions".
753.5 trillion pesetas have been paid to supporters from TRT, the people's pocket.
This is an outrage.
He gave up the suicide , got down on his knees and apologized to his wife .
The incident occurred at a parking lot on Değirmen Street in Eyupoglu neighborhood.
According to reports, residents saw a citizen hanging from the fourth floor of the parking lot and reported the situation to the fire and medical teams.
Firefighters responded to the scene and set up a perimeter while medics were on standby.
Yunus G., a 34-year-old father of three, who refused to commit suicide after psychologists and police teams were called to the scene, apologized by kneeling in front of his wife N.G., who was watching him in tears.
On the other hand, in the street where Yunus G. attempted suicide, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks watching the situation, while some citizens recorded it with their mobile phones.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce soon that it will leave interest rates unchanged, after reducing speculation that slow economic growth and spiraling inflation will be an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "sluggish" as household incomes shrink as they hold interest rates steady.
Decision-makers on the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25%, thus requiring fewer increases this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that household incomes would continue to contract, with inflation still expected to rise close to 3% in the spring.
However, he signalled that interest rate increases were necessary to curb Brexit-fuelled inflation over the next few years, and said borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to roll back part of the massive post-Brexit economic recovery package launched a year ago.
The Bank said it would end the Periodic Financing Scheme, which offered cheap funding to banks from next February, but expected to offer a further £15 billion (£115 billion in total) under the scheme.
Minutes after the rate decision was taken, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) continues to be slow in the short term as contraction in real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption".
Regarding interest rates, he stressed that "some tightening in monetary policy" may be necessary to alleviate inflation, and that they will be "a bit higher" than the market expects.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "gradual" and "limited".
May's estimates compare with the bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next at 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to leave it unchanged came after the latest growth figures, which disappointed with GDP at 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter, tempered expectations of multiplying growth.
Growth will probably remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will start to pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
While the bank says the contraction will get worse before it gets better, the latest inflation report leaves little to cheer for households hit by rising inflation and paltry wage increases.
The bank said that monetary policy would "not prevent" a hit to incomes over the next few years, but that it expected wages to improve "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
Increased demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by offsetting some of the decline in consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote that sent the pound tumbling.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully affect prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's latest interest rate decision, inflationary pressures on struggling households were mounting and demand for a rate hike was rising, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, but the bank said it was expected to rise once again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess over their 2% target was "entirely" related to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent declines in swap rates, the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as lenders demand business is done and the year ends positively.
The market for re-mortgages is looking particularly good for those nearing the end of their current contracts, with many free options and low interest rates becoming more popular than ever".
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Following a High Court battle over NHS funding for the drug, patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by around 86 percent in high-risk individuals, will be provided by health services to around 10,000 people through a 3-year pilot trial.
The High Court decision last year agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld it, saying the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities were funding it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed as a 'new and serious intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'turning point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first clinics to enroll the public, with more clinics joining in October and being fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a range of HIV medications that reduce the risk of contracting HIV before sex.
The trials showed that PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough of the medication in their body to prevent HIV infection from taking hold.
These medications can be taken every day or up to two hours before sex.
Eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and those with HIV-positive partners who cannot be successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible men, women, transgender individuals, and individuals whose partners are not known to be controlling their HIV status with antiretroviral therapy.
People living in the UK and registered with a GP will also be able to register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed an agreement this week to provide the drugs through an international tender.
The trial was designed to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, administered and delivered at scale.
Mr. Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in three decades of progress toward conquering one of mankind's major health problems".
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: 'This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If properly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, PrEP has the potential to transform the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people who are at high risk of HIV, through this NHS-funded trial in the UK, will have access to a new and powerful tool that is truly personally controlled and non-negotiable with a partner, which will lead to many lives being improved.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now must be to rapidly roll out testing across the country and ensure that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the experimental PrEP drug is available, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the fact that the PrEP trial has started and has been delayed by months of delays and then government resistance.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
The trial will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important that this trial be rolled out across the country as quickly as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in the community.

The two mysteries of death
Umut Makbule Çilingiroglu (51), the Washington-born daughter of former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroglu, fell to her death from the 19th floor of a business center that was also used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
Melis Salihoğlu, a 24-year-old student at Koç University, was also found dead in his home.
It was suggested that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
Two mysterious deaths occurred in quick succession and were ruled as suicides by the police.
"I was depressed"
Ümit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, the daughter of Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, who served in the government of Nihat Erim in 1971, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1.
A Kuwaiti tourist who was staying in a room on the 19th floor saw Çilingiroğlu's lifeless body and called the hotel management, who called an ambulance and police.
The medical team determined that Çilingiroğlu died after falling from the 19th floor to the hard floor.
His mother, Mediha Çilingiroğlu, told the police, "He was depressed lately".
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a granddaughter with leukemia from my other daughter.
"He was concerned about my granddaughter and was affected by her illness", she said.
Çilingiroğlu's body was taken to the Forensic Medical Institution and is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is being investigated whether Çilingiroğlu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
'CANINA KYDI' is the claim
The other suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, 24, a student at Koç University, was found dead in his home.
Allegedly, the girl's father went to his daughter's house near the school, where he had not heard from her and could not reach her by cell phone.
The father found his daughter's lifeless body in the house.
Beloved by her family, friends and neighbors, it was suggested that Melis hanged herself in her home.
Melis Salihoğlu's death has plunged his family and relatives into mourning.
Following Melis, a friend wrote on social media, "The sun was beating down on us".
The green grass beneath our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eyşan chasing that little plastic ball.
"What was the need to die now?" he wrote.
Living in luxury, the penthouse and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for property renovation, went into downsizing in 2014, moving from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court.
It's on the first floor of a fancy Queen Anne-style terrace, and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne was convinced before she packed her bags.
"Before that, I was living with my ex-boyfriend in a much larger area in Knightsbridge", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something to match my price.
I was shown the flat in Earl Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and proposed that day".
After the first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment was completely renovated.
It was originally a one-room property with a complicated layout; you had to go through the kitchen to reach the bedroom.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, and lots of light.
That was my condition".
To this end, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed hired Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not just a structure but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a suspended floor that you could stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they could be stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel in such a way that it was the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement, with many additional dramas, allowed Erfan to have two full-size rooms on top of each other.
An old-style copper skylight from Retrouvius for the mezzanine overlooks the magnificent living space below.
Mirrored gold-colored furniture, silver accents, and old-style Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
Mirrors placed at each end of the short corridor make it appear longer.
The mirrored firewall in the kitchen feels like a window into another room.
The mirrored units in the hallway provide storage for Joanne's entire set of cutlery and silverware.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a greater sense of space, is that you can close the kitchen when you're not using it.
The pop-up kitchens are not new.
What's unique about this one is that it has a garage-style lift-up door.
"We used a bit of engineering on this one", explains Erfan, the steel-reinforced polished MDF door.
"It has a counterweight so when you push the door up it slides really easily".
Through clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom and an improved seating plan.
"At the end of the day, residential space is what you sell, or what your property is valued at", says Erfan.
"Initially, a real estate agent will come in and do a calculation based on the seating area".
Here, while increasing the floor space, they've managed to use quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
"Materials are objects that you touch", says Erfan, "so they help you bond emotionally at home".
"At home, you don't fall in love with the wires in the wall.
These things are important, but they do not tug at your heartstrings".
It's proof that through good design and increased square footage, an apartment can go from something standard to something quite spectacular.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens is in Beşiktaş with his bonservis.
At the end of 1.5 months of negotiations, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with the Lens bonservice, which was originally thought to be a rental.
After a week of intense negotiations, Lens have signed the black and whites for a bonus fee of 5 million euros.
The Dutchman has signed a five-year contract worth €2.2 million per year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official announcement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples.
Model Çağla Şikel and actor and singer Emre Altuğ, who have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for about 4 years, entered the world in Sortie.
The couple immortalized their wedding ceremony, which they described as "the most special moment of our lives".
The couple decided to separate after 7 years.
The brothers are fighting over a $500 million real estate empire.
Forty years after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors down from his younger brother Paul, who has taken himself to the High Court over how properties and business assets should be divided.
Paul had wanted out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court was still wrestling with whether to break it up.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, accumulated since they bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain with 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in property, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contracting sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement made with their deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as "a major driving force and dominant figure" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul one-third.
A court filing says that means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million.
For Paul, the division of property and cash is proving contentious.
In his first affidavit to the court in 2015, he wrote, "The partitions proposed by Colin left him with what I have always considered the best estates".
Last Friday was the first Supreme Court hearing after several failed mediations.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the existing business; Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin argues that's not true, but he accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
Colin, in his initial sworn statement, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate that family is the most important priority".
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails filed by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and top lawyers like Allan Myers, QC and senior legal counsel retained by both sides, add to the costs of the case.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family who ran grocery stores and delicatessens starting in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They mortgaged their property to buy the Collingwood estate where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he founded Westco there "during my senior year in high school, when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave their assets to their sons in an amicable manner.
"Luigi often told me that he wished he had never taken a brother to court", he wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; according to Colin, Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the business.
Both Luke and Mark, says Paul, "were unhappy with the terms of their financial separation".
According to a 2015 biography by the TV star's best friend, Eddi McGuire, Colin tried to keep a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded with a text message saying, "I can't say much because the case is in court".
She wrote: "It has been very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts".
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to fall into the current dispute", she said, adding that she was "still hopeful for a resolution".
By Friday, that hope seemed lost.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future".
Trump's new personal pen plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff will restrict the flow of information (including news media reports) to President Trump in hopes of keeping his boss more stable.
Here's a little bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he outlined a fundamental problem President Donald Trump plans to solve with the White House: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information should flow through him, whether on paper or in briefings, because the president would be able to make better decisions when given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others have tried and failed to moderate Trump by controlling his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits are still good.
Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February, "If candidate Trump is sorry he didn't get a fair shake in the media, it was productivity-enhancing to show him he got a fair shake in persuadable media organizations".
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check was to ensure his personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise".
Okay, I got it.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't, like Trump's tweets would be far more inflammatory without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his people were able to get him out of harm's way even a few times, then it was worth it.
But no one could stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of competing factions, people who were always trying to advance their own agenda with the materials they presented to Trump (which could be reliable or unreliable) and promoting their own worldviews.
Politico reported in May that throughout this whole story, advisers strategically tended to feed the president dubious information.
One example, detailed by reporter Shane Goldmacher, was this:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted furiously to negative clippings from the press, especially leaks that have had a chilling effect, and is preoccupied with finding out where they originated.
That's what happened in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com that accused special assistant Katie Walsh of being the "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn't matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he had made false accusations in the past and then retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff questions about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-special pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "tried to put in place a system that managed and documented the paperwork Trump received".
What was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
He may emerge as a more effective executive than Priebus, but Trump is still his own man and his aides are still vying for influence.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's task very difficult.
Crypto FETÖ"cüleri revealed with a special pattern
İzmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation he started after the secret witness code-named "Sarmaşık" said that the Chief of Staff of the Naval Forces Command, Rear Admiral Cihat Yaycı, was a FETÖ member within the scope of the investigation into irregularities in the "military espionage investigation" and the leak of some information.
In the study, it was emphasized that contrary to the fact that Admiral Yaycı was not a member of the organization, he helped the investigating authority in decrypting the members of the crypto organization in the Naval Forces Command and played an active role in the fight against FETÖ.
In the decision, which pointed out that Yaycı was given to the Naval Forces Command in accordance with the so-called martial law order in the coup attempt on July 15, it was underlined that Yaycı had fought effectively against FETÖ since the first day of the coup attempt.
The following statements were used in the decision of non-follow-up issued by Karakaya: "It is understood that Yaycı worked on the identification of crypto Naval Forces Command personnel through a special template for the identification of FETÖ members belonging to the crypto secret services class and a special system created on the basis of 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria".
It has been decided that it is not possible for the Attorney General's Office to evaluate an assessment based on speculation about Yaycı, who is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization as a result of his struggle and has made great contributions in this direction.
Rear Admiral Yaycı has been tried for contempt before.
It turned out that FETÖ was behind it and the alleged crime was a conspiracy.
Former Air Force Pilot Staff Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that Yaycı insulted him, turned the complaint into a document.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van, former General Staff Headquarters Legal Advisor Colonel Muharrem Köse, who authorized the investigation, former General Staff Headquarters Intelligence Chief Lieutenant General Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge Major Erkan Ağın, former Navy Captain Necmettin Aksoy, who authorized the prosecution, former Judge Captain Akif Us and former Judge Lieutenant Serdar Çamiçi and former General Staff Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, who testified as a witness against Yaycı, were expelled from the TSK because of their links to FETÖ.
It was revealed that some members of the organization, including Tuncay Opçin, a FETÖ defector, targeted Yaycı with their social media posts before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
The travelers crossed the moat, back to their 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the wealthiest landlords in the West Midlands are fighting back against determined travellers who have overrun a council-built moat to reclaim land outside their mansions.
The travelers parked their 20 trailers outside what was once Solihull's fashionable thoroughfare and was referred to as 'the rich man's neighborhood.'
Undeterred by the ditch the Council had dug to stop their advance, they returned with horses, babies and a load of wagons, having only been driven out in May.
Cleverly, the group found a gap in the defense, infiltrated their vehicles through a section left unbarricaded.
Angry residents lashed out at Solihull Council, saying it was 'useless in solving the problem'.
An unnamed resident said: "They arrived on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath where they were throwing stones at passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of its actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent out, and now they're back again.
More came in last night, probably more today".
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with the lengthy removal orders taken to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I'm not happy to keep paying my taxes when the council can't even stop this.'
A local resident, who did not want to give his name, said: 'As a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, and we were immediately mobbed by a new group.
Their numbers had increased, and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware that there is an unauthorised encampment on the Streetsbrook Street property, and we are taking the necessary legal steps to remove them as soon as possible.
To aid in our collection of evidence, it is vital that as many residents as possible call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police.
This will help paint a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to the court.'
Galatasaray has listed Ndiaye on the stock exchange.
According to a statement sent by Galatasaray Sportif Sınai ve Ticari Yatırımlar AŞ to Borsa İstanbul and published on the Kamuyu Aydınlatma Platform, the yellow-red club will pay Osmanlıspor 7 million 500 thousand euros for the player's bonservis fee, 750 thousand if he plays a total of 25 matches in the league, cup and Europe, and 750 thousand if he plays 50 more matches.
Galatasaray will also pay Ndiaye, who has signed a four-year contract, a total of 11 million euros in guaranteed fees, 2 million 750 thousand euros for each year.
In addition, Ndiaye will receive a bonus of 5,000 euros for each point scored by the yellow-red team in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
The statement also announced that the player has the right to terminate the contract unilaterally from 15 June 2019 for 18 million euros.
The rush of the last day!
They stormed the fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in Istanbul last Thursday's storm and hail.
While many of the drivers who received reports from the fire department filed their reports to have the damages covered by insurance companies, drivers who had not received reports to date also queued up for reports.
Drivers with helmets who didn't report to the fire department today, as this is the last day of the reporting period, came to the fire stations and requested a report.
Today is the last day
The drivers first had their vehicles photographed by firefighters to determine the extent of the damage.
The drivers, whose vehicles were found to be damaged, later filed reports with officials.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've had it recorded, I'll have it photographed".
It was busy when I arrived.
He said, "There was damage to the windshield".
The driver, Erbil Kılıç, said, "We came running".
We're in the queue.
We got the picture.
"Now we'll wait for the report", he said.
The skyscrapers that stand like walls between the sea and the land are breathtaking
CHP Member of Parliament Nadir Ataman issued an earthquake warning about the giant structures rising on the coast and noted: "The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand an earthquake of magnitude 6".
It is said that the stakes were not driven so deep that the solid rock was 25 to 30 meters below.
Istanbul's Ataköy coastal district has been left breathless by high-rise hotels and residences that form a wall between the sea and the land.
CHP Bakırköy Municipality Member of Parliament Nadir Ataman reacted to the giant shopping mall, hotel and residence projects built one after another in the district.
Ataman pointed out that the buildings on the coast cut the wind, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest in Florya.
Eighty years later, they've reached a point of urban understanding where they've erected giant skyscrapers in wind corridors and changed the climate.
He said, "We can't breathe in the county".
Ataman stated that the buildings rising like a wall on the Ataköy coast are changing the balance of the climate: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers".
These buildings need to be built in the direction of the wind.
But our skyscrapers rise above the windy corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures upset the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of Bakırköy people with the sea, adding that they will apply to the Monuments Board and go to court.
There are non-surgical treatments for alopecia.
In cases where phenol is used, the success rate is as high as 83 percent.
In this method, diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills the hair follicles.
Another non-surgical hair loss treatment technique is the laser method.
Various lasers burn the hair follicles and surrounding tissue with circular beams, causing the tissues to stick together as they burn.
With these two non-surgical methods of treating alopecia, patients can return to social and work life more quickly.
Dr. Mert Atak stated that excessive weight, sedentary lifestyle, sitting for long periods of time, dense hair and body hair and not following hygiene rules cause hair loss, and the symptoms of the disease include pain, infection, abscess and swelling in the tailbone.
Italy toughening approach to migrant rescue boats by NGOs
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules affecting their operations.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new statute, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate", Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German charity Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew actively collaborated with human traffickers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has only been active for a year, declined to comment on the content of the detailed charges brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the organization said: "For us, saving human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue area at this time".
"Only after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation can we make an assessment of the allegations that are being made at this time".
The Italian authorities had been watching the boat of Jugend Rettet, the Iuventa, since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board rubber boats full of migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allowing the smugglers to escape in the boats, to be used again.
According to the prosecutor's files published by Italian media, at least one such encounter allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, more for humanitarian efforts than any other reason.
According to the charter, boats like the Iuventa had to have an Italian police officer on board to oversee their activities.
Of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS, and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Tuesday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" to its own rescue operations.
Among those refusing to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues in recent weeks was an indication that efforts to strengthen Libya's coastguard and its cooperation with local governors were bearing fruit.
"In recent days", the minister said, "we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel".
This month, he announced plans to hold further talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in the hope of reaching Europe.
The last-minute punch!
In the Russian capital of Moscow, watermelon was eaten and vodka was drunk as part of the annual celebration of the "day of the paratroopers".
A Russian who attended the event and overindulged in alcohol attacked Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who was broadcasting live from Gorky Park.
Reporting live on the day's events, the reporter warned the man who suddenly appeared and shouted "We will conquer Ukraine" to "Please be quiet".
The drunken man, said to be a former paratrooper, punched him hard after the reporter warned him.
Stunned by the punch, the reporter tried to get away from the man.
Millions watched the shocking moment live on television.
The Economic Coordination Council has met.
The Economic Coordination Board (EKK) met under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economy Mehmet Şimşek.
After the cabinet change in the government, the first meeting of the ECC under the chairmanship of Şimşek started at 18.30 at Çankaya Köşkü.
Turkey's macroeconomic outlook will be discussed at the meeting.
The meeting chaired by Şimşek was attended by Finance Minister Naci Ağbal, Science, Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlü, Labor and Social Security Minister Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Customs and Trade Minister Bülent Tüfenkci, Development Minister Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Undersecretary Osman Çelik, Central Bank President Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrats.
You can get rid of a hernia in 45 minutes.
Noting that only 5 percent of patients need surgery to treat a hernia, Associate Professor Dr. Oğuz Karaeminoğlu says: "The first step is rest and medication according to the patient's examination and imaging results".
Stating that invasive methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, intra-disc interventions) should be tried especially in the patient group where the pain continues, Oğuz Karaeminoğlu warns, "If all these methods cannot be successful, if numbness and weakness in the legs are evident, then the operation becomes difficult".
Karaeminoğulları explains that today's minimally invasive 'fully closed hernia surgery' has also reduced the hesitancy of patients who have not been successful with invasive methods.
Although microscopic surgery has better outcomes than open surgery, there are some complications, such as a long recovery period, adhesions to the spine, recurrence of the hernia, and possible future slippage and infection.
Often microscopic surgery is described as 'closed surgery' but microscopic surgery is also performed with the same approach as open surgery.
With a completely closed hernia, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissue is preserved.
A fully closed lumbar hernia only takes 45 minutes.
The special commission is at work
CHP deputies Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Yarkadaş and Turan Aydoğan, who is a member of the High Disciplinary Board, will be part of the commission.
The Commission was informed of Berberoğlu's statement on 4 October at the Istanbul 14.
The hearing in the High Criminal Court will be followed by appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeal.
CHP General Secretary Kamil Okyay Sındır and Deputy General Chairman Bülent Tezcan signed the letter saying, "The independence and impartiality of the judiciary and the fact that it does not take orders from anywhere other than the law is an indispensable condition for justice".
"Our MP, Enis Berberoğlu, did not demand any special status while performing his duties as a member of parliament, did not take refuge in the immunity armor of his parliamentary duties, wanted to maintain his belief in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary", it said.
It has been argued that the process of the trial was such that the court preferred to implement political orders rather than conduct the trial.
The article argued that despite the Constitutional Court's finding that the MPs' arrests were wrong, the fact that the arrest warrant was issued before the verdict was finalized is clear evidence that the court made the decision under influence.
Michelle Carter was convicted of texting Conrad Roy urging him to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years of supervised release.
Carter was convicted in June of vehicular manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
Mr Roy's father told the court on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was granted bail pending appeal.
Although she faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, her legal team argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter was sentenced with teary eyes, hands clasped and eyes on the ground.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy".
He ended her life to heal his own.
He didn't accept responsibility".
"He showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible situation for which he deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not see that her "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness played any significant role in her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There is not a day that goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I handled everything, and I'm trying to be there for her sisters with all the pain that we will carry forever".
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the fact that she could never attend her brother's wedding, or be a mother to his children, was "in the back of her mind".
He said, "It's a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life that the person you were with every day since I was born is no more".
Since there's no Massachusetts statute that criminalizes telling someone to kill themselves, the case is likely to generate controversy.
Carter was 17 when Mr. Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case gained national attention when it was revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged her to end her own life.
While he was on vacation with his family, she sent him several text messages two weeks before his death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, lots of ways".
Moments before her suicide, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and, "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz instructed that Carter not be allowed to profit from this case through the press, saying that Carter wanted to attract attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, saying: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail".
Stunning growth prediction from Mehmet Simsek
Şimşek, in his statement, stated that inflation in Turkey should fall to low single digits and said that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his speech, Lightning said:
The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, the uncertainties in our immediate geography will also diminish.
By increasing our resilience to shocks with some reform, I believe we can put Turkey on a growth trend of over 5 percent.
I told you months ago.
Because the worst is over.
Gradually, we're going to shift our energy from those areas to focusing on inclusive growth, job-creating reforms...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
Reform on the one hand, political uncertainty on the other hand, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we'll have better luck and less trouble in our immediate vicinity.
Whether we like it or not, many of our traditional markets have collapsed.
Libya is like Iraq.
We're not just losing Sundays, we're facing an exodus of over 3.5 million.
When we look at the last 15 years, despite all these shocks, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent.
Turkey, that's us, we have solid problems.
Now, with some reforms, by increasing our resilience to shocks, and by removing more of the question marks from investors' minds, we can put Turkey back on a growth path above 5%.
To be honest, I'm from here, we have such a generous pension system.
I think it's fair to say that our pension companies aren't doing enough.
Once it's auto-joined, the performance will be strong.
What's the point?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go out and spend effort and expense.
We've taken these concerns into account, given the underperformance, and we've worked out how we're going to allocate global assets to which investment areas.
Deposits, as you know, have a high yield.
First of all, there will be a performance in addition to the 25% that the government gives.
Plus the rest in Treasury bonds, where the risk is usually low.
I think you'll be more interested in the coming period when we look at the big picture.
Because they're going to see the performance.
In the other field, it's not a failure, it's a success.
We restructured the BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, there are 70 billion pounds of savings.
I gotta hand it to you, the system works.
There are 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, and there are 775 million liras in savings.
We're asking for a little more effort from the companies.
Give them a little publicity, tell them about this system.
We're in a holding pattern.
Maybe if we stretched it out a little...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the returns, see the savings, and stay in the system.
The clearance rate is 38 percent.
Almost half of those leaving are in voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two separate retirement accounts.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're out of the car pool.
We were actually expecting a drop of about 10 percent.
That means we're overly optimistic.
For once, the system works.
We put a ceiling on the premium.
Insurance companies are one-sided. Sometimes they explain.
They raised their premiums too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said that the judicial decisions did not take into account the existing regulations.
We just made a clean break.
We told you to do what you had to do.
They said, "No, we are waiting".
And we said, that's not gonna happen.
We have a disagreement here.
Of course, when this ceiling premium went into effect, some companies backed out.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of at-risk policyholders.
I'll say it again.
I prefer to run this system by competition.
I mean, I don't think these price ceilings are right.
I'd like to see this in 3D.
Consider the system we've created.
Two, get the system up and running, a pricing on that trail.
In addition to that, the burden is heavy, almost 30-31 liras of every 100 lira premium paid goes to SGK tax deductions.
I'm working right now, so we'll talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is advancing rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also decrease dramatically, structurally.
But this is compulsory motor insurance.
The cover of SABAH saved his leg.
Buerger's disease, which begins in adolescence, used to affect males but is now more common in females.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehtap Dursun.
Two years ago, he developed chronic pain in his foot.
Faced with the risk of losing her leg, the young woman, who had difficulty walking, went from hospital to hospital.
A friend of his recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
SABAH showed the headline 'He saved the life of Azerbaijan's Minister of Emergency Situations'.
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to emergency surgery.
Dursun soon recovered from his injuries and is now receiving oxygen therapy.
Audi to Modify 850,000 Diesels as Car Manufacturers React
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
Referring to European cities, including BMW's headquarters in Munich (where a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles is being considered), the BMW board chairman said the firm believes "there are more smart options than driving restrictions".
Daimler said on Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies identified these moves as recalls.
European automakers had heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles to help offset carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
However, the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are classified as carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automakers must install to neutralize diesel exhaust is also rising, making it difficult for cars to remain competitively priced.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring signs of trouble.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed its use of a device known as a defeat device and adjusted emissions to comply with regulations while a car was being tested, relaxing them under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against criminal extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, which expanded the United States-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker has an excessive share of Volkswagen's profits.
Don't jump to conclusions
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, President of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned against jumping into shallow places of more than 2 meters, where the depth is not certain.
Every year, thousands of people risk paralysis from neck fractures and spinal cord injuries from diving into shallow water.
Neck fractures most commonly occur at the fifth or sixth vertebra.
Fractures at this level are characterized by involvement of the nerves that supply the respiratory muscles as well as the muscles of the arms and legs.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "In this type of accident, the cervical spine, which is our most valuable organ, is severed or compressed by the broken spine due to the fracture".
He said, "In the case of spinal cord injuries, incorrect first aid not only increases the damage to the accident victims, it can also lead to death".
Scuba diving is the fourth leading cause of spinal cord injury.
The average age of the wounded is between 20 and 29, and most of them are men.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, "You shouldn't jump into the unknown".
He said, "No matter how well you dive, you can still get hurt".
Prof. Dr. Çağlar also reminded:
Paralysis of the arms and legs can occur to varying degrees, depending on the level of the spinal cord where the injury occurred.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceptive.
What seems deep to you may be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, coastal warning signs have reduced the number of people jumping into shallow waters by 70 percent.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "In Turkey, although 28 provinces have a coastline, unfortunately, there is not a single warning sign outside Istanbul".
"Before every summer, the health directorate of every province, schools and social awareness projects should have information lights or information boards on beaches and pools", he said.
TÜRK Neurosurgery Association Spinal and Peripheral Neurosurgery Group Chairman Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil suggested the following in case of injury:
The first thing to do is call 911.
The neck should be held as steady as possible, not moved, fixed with a rigid collar.
An airway must be provided and the patient must be placed on his back to drain fluid from the lungs.
It should not be held by the legs and dangled to drain the water.
No attempt should be made to correct the deformity of the patient's neck.
The cervical vertebrae may be fractured.
However, if the spinal cord has not yet been damaged, first aid and improper positioning of the neck during patient transport can cause broken bone fragments to press on the spinal cord and cut and damage it.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
It's become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there's a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less rain in spring and mostly in autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a leaf pest that transmits microorganisms, and they are abundant in very dry weather".
And a lot is at stake.
In addition to attracting vacationers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Where there should be very tall plants with a few large flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped or nonexistent or weak spikes.
So we have less of the fatty parts".
Solutions under consideration include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mud-and-water mixture and developing drought-tolerant varieties.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the latest unrest in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials, and the endless drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office that was targeted by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, just perceptions and gut feelings.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a list full of bad guys who make it dangerous to cover Mexico's chaos.
As the violence continues and the body count rises across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
Among the latest to die is Javier Valdez Cardenas, editorial director and co-founder of the inspirational Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", writes Valdez in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt but his presence is everywhere, with a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger and the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of Riodoce's building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, glasses and his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after her death, and the reporters talk about their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it has prosecuted only two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with many of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In Rio de Janeiro, although their hearts are broken, although the ground is now more treacherous, they insist on referring to the violence in Sinaloa.
Without information about the killers, without justice, negotiating security is of little use, says Ibarra.
He says, "It's stupid to waste my time in this workshop".
"You don't trust anyone until we know why".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce's office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He was able to drive only a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forcibly removed from his vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the title of his newspaper, which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman got into her car and drove away, hitting her nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by his wife and two grown children.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to run free.
But there's been almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the US in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival groups battle to fill the void.
Never mind that one or more people are shot and killed on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums of drug lords larger than most people's homes.
Forget for a minute the "calm" that only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, was wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, a February broadcast featured an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups at war with Guzman's sons.
This article may have angered the sons; potential gang members bought every copy of the edition as soon as it was distributed to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper with the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican-originated violence against journalists.
He had survived so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in the Northeast in 2013 when he joined five colleagues in unveiling Riodoce by selling $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without talking about drugs", Bojorquez said.
In time, the paper gained a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved publishing vital investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were drawn to a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for having the courage to pursue the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to go on living".
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life".
"As a journalist, you have to accept your role, or play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
The staff at Riodoce miss Valdez, the joker who swore like a bellhop, the friends who were generous with hugs and advice, the teachers who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to a bar across the street called El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking: Did his love of routine collapse?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and survive.
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their kids, their clean jobs, the secret airstrips they use to smuggle drugs".
Bojorquez said, "These things were out of line".
The result was a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation at the best of times.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, editorial director of Riodoce, said, "Smell is a sense that can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say the old rules don't apply in Sinaloa, just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The ground keeps shifting.
Suddenly no cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training; days ago, spyware sold only to governments was found to be used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought refuge in the shade of a tree from the 104 degrees Fahrenheit [40°C] heat.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, half-seriously, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of cops that the governor himself said were untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters ventured into the mountainous countryside effectively controlled by drug gangs.
In this week's issue, Riodoce examines three main stories.
Former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez had his brother murdered in Sinaloa.
There was also the exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at the most expensive restaurant in Culiacan, one block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official explanation as to who was kidnapped or how, so caution prevailed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew: The restaurant was a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated almost every level of politics for the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational cases.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events at that scene, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons during a military raid.
Only months ago, readers would have turned to Valdez's column for the best source of information about the kidnapping.
"We already knew what happened before", said Villareal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender build.
"All communication channels with our sources have now been cut off".
Valdez's office is being repurposed as a repository for banners and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, while the staff is turning into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some banners and demonstrated for another journalist at the local prosecutor's office the next morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been found and DNA tests have confirmed it's him.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal in organized protests, writing "Help the Press" on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is far away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked to be reassigned to something other than doing government news, feeling that his anger was compromising his neutrality.
Valdez said that journalists in Mexico are constantly "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by order of politicians and security forces collaborating with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You die in Mexico because they want to silence you".
The murders were clearly a cold shower.
No one has forgotten the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note said to be signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news".
A computer keyboard and a headset lined up next to his severed head.
Following the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in the northern border state of Chihuahua in March, some publications, such as El Norte, chose to shut down.
Others, like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo, continue after their manager was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial entitled: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states, even the country.
It's a twisted decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still roam the streets, waiting for danger.
Sometimes they're captured, as evidenced by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, along with four women, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
It's a daily dance with these high-stakes decisions for those who stay behind and keep working.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that covering the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter".
At midnight on a recent Saturday, as the editorial staff of Riodoce sat drinking beer on the sidewalk outside their office while preparing to finish the final issue, their phones began to ring simultaneously.
A series of gun battles involving rival gangs and security forces near the coastal resort of Mazatlan have left 19 confirmed dead.
As promised in a series of cartel messages found in the vicinity, the war continued to heat up.
They put the story on Riodoce's website using their cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens are going off nearby, there's another gunfight in the area.
Bojorquez glanced quickly at the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Under a giant portrait of his newspaper's defeated founders, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you think of closing", Bojorquez said, "when the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out to cover the street?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
Researchers now report that the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner are so well preserved that experts have described it as the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the skin of the scales was reddish brown and that it had a 'troubled past.'
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best preserved dinosaur genera in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived from the mid-Cretaceous Period, 110 million to 112 million years ago.
Its remarkably well-preserved condition has baffled researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable.'
The herbivorous armadillo is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while excavating the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that looked strange compared to the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years unearthing the wild animal from a 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) mound of earth.
After such intensive work, the finished result is now ready to be presented.
Lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display, said: 'If you squint a little, you can almost believe it's asleep.'
'It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
By examining its skin, researchers found that although it was covered in armor and looked like a walking tank, this plant-eater likely faced a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
Heavily armoured, the dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and employed a protective technique known as countershading, used by many modern animals.
Experts suggest it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend in better and evade predators.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers have now completed their work and have named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team that painstakingly spent more than 7,000 hours unearthing it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species has allowed Dr. Mitchell and his international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and the body armor.
They discovered countershading, a common defense mechanism in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature is darker than the bottom.
Although countershading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds that of any countershading animals alive today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently oppressed and hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose hiding over confrontation as a method of survival.
But most modern animals that use countershading (such as deer, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and much more likely to be prey, meaning that this nodosaur faced a serious challenge to its survival.
'The powerful hunting of a huge, heavily armoured animal shows just how dangerous dinosaur predators in the Cretaceous could be,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the surface of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans probably extended farther inland than they do now.
"Nodozor is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered and preserved in scaly skin, but also in that the original shape of the animal is preserved in 3D", Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks pretty much the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to reconstruct it; if you squint a little, you can almost believe it's asleep.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, two-legged meat-eating dinosaurs, roamed the Earth.
Although it's the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armoured dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by some of its massive ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11.5m) long, 6-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was dragged out to sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and it's intact from nose to hip.
The creature averages around 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It has two 20-inch long horns protruding from its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armoured grazer hobbled around in what is now western Canada until it was swept out to sea by a flooding river.
But the dinosaur's underwater grave preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that pieces of skin still cover the bumpy armor layers across the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this degree of preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it is.
Fossilized skin fragments still cover the dinosaur's skull, dotted with bumpy layers of armor.
His right front leg is lying on its side, five toes bent upwards.
I can count the scales on your feet".
Don't be afraid to whiten your teeth
White teeth and an aesthetically pleasing smile are everyone's dream.
While people resort to various methods to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, president of the Association of Oral Laser Applications, warns against products sold in stores or on the Internet.
"Tooth whitening can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of the teeth like fingernails", says Berk, noting that such commercial products scratch the enamel and permanently stain the teeth.
Noting that maintaining dental health prevents the occurrence of many diseases, and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health by providing both dental and gum health and a beautiful smile, Berk shares the following information:
Unless there is a defect in the tooth structure or genetic factors, young people usually have white teeth.
Teeth darken over the years as a result of aging, the wearing away of enamel, and the frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasives, or dark-colored beverages.
Teeth can be whitened with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that adhere like fingernails, with minimal or no abrasion to the surface of the teeth.
You should never whiten your teeth with over-the-counter products.
Because these substances scratch the enamel surface, permanently staining the teeth.
Keçiören Municipality has been providing "Home Dental and Oral Health Service" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens since 2011.
65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has been confined to bed for 24 years in Uyanış neighborhood of Keçiören, said, "My wife found out about this service of Keçiören Municipality".
We called the city, they came right over.
"I'm already paralyzed from the neck down", she said, "so at least I'm not neglecting my dental hygiene".
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı neighborhood, said, "My mother has been bedridden for 7.5 years due to old age".
When I got to city hall, I saw the posters for this service, and I called right away.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have problems with my teeth too, and when doctors come, they look at me too.
"Very pleased", he said.
No health insurance is required for the service, which is completely free.
"Kidem" incident in the Turkish army
My dear readers, at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council (SMC) held the previous day, very interesting decisions were made, especially regarding the Navy.
This task force is commanded by a rear admiral, not a vice admiral.
It's practically unheard of in our military.
So how did this happen?
Force Commander Oramiral Bülent Bostanoğlu has completed his term and was about to retire...
And it did.
Now it was the turn of the only admiral, Veysel Kösele.
Veysel Pasha, who was a victim of a coup in the past and was imprisoned for some time, was supposed to be a commander in the normal senior rank.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to make it very clear, starting at the very top of the Marine Corps, commanders number one, three, four and five have not been promoted.
That leaves only one vice admiral in the Navy.
The vacant position was supposed to be filled by Admiral Veysel Kösele, Commander of the Navy.
And then what happened?
Rear Admiral Adnan Özbal, ranked sixth, was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but a junior officer is being appointed in his place!
A senior is subordinate to a junior.
I wonder what's gonna happen next.
A vice admiral of superior rank does not and cannot serve under a lieutenant general of inferior rank.
He doesn't take orders from her, he can't.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this painful situation, if he is not sent to retirement, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the insulting message he received from the government: "Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!"
The news of his resignation had spread around the time I wrote this article yesterday afternoon, but the situation had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's look at these events again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, forced him to resign, and replaced him with a sixth-rank Koramirali, violating our army's traditional understanding of "Kıdem".
There's bound to be politics involved, and we don't know what goes on behind the scenes.
Maybe soon someone will tell us and we'll all find out!
My dear readers, I tried to explain very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the issue of seniority is very important.
It's not just the rank.
For example, an officer who finished 10th in the Military Academy is more senior than an officer who finished 11th.
The one promoted to general from the first rank is more senior than the one promoted from the second rank.
We saw concrete examples of this in the War of Independence.
Ismet Pasha, commander of the Western Front...
You have two armies at your command.
The Army and the 2nd Army.
It's 1922, and our armies are about to launch a major offensive to drive out the Greek army.
At this stage, there are some worthy names waiting to be appointed to command the army.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered the command of the army, but he says, "Immed is senior to me, I cannot come under his command".
Also known as Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Ataturk's teacher at the Military Academy...
A beloved and revered commander, whom he called "Master", and who fought in many battles.
In 1919, he was captured along with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and deported to the island of Malta by the British.
Returning home, he too is reluctant to command the army and says the same: "The commander of the western front is junior to me, I cannot take orders from him".
However, Atatürk persuades him, and Yakup Şevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha. He was a member of the Ottoman parliament.
A soldier who talks too much, always criticizing.
A commander who has fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on several fronts.
He was exiled to Malta by the British, escaped and came to Ankara via Kusadasi.
When he was offered the command of the army, Ali İhsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight under the command of Ismet, who is junior to me"...
But he's being persuaded...
But since he took office, he's been constantly arguing with the commander of the Western Front, Ismet Pasha, causing trouble and disturbing the army.
And shortly before the great offensive, he is dismissed and retired, replaced by the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali İhsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never improved.
The problem of seniority in the Turkish army is prominent not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course it should.
Veysel Kösele is the latest example.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after arriving in New York City for a visit, the St. Louis native sat down on the bed of her Airbnb rental and started scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
It's a match to someone from high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the street".
Surprised that no one else in his feed shared this information, he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah was constantly being retweeted in his feed.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was shot and killed by an unarmed black police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is wild".
But death was not new to him or to his people.
He left his phone to return to tweeting about people gathering on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were police tapes, people screaming, and photos of a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another officer, he said, cocked the trigger of his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals".
Ferrell recalled him saying, "'That's unusual.'"
"'This is not the kind of murder we're used to, nor is it typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying".
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to drive to Ferguson with her the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" Coming to theaters August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the perspective of the people who live in that community and fill the streets with the answers they seek.
As Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with his daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and a matching tiara, they returned to the conversation "about the black experience and the black condition" they had had many times before that morning.
"Remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe in?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old kid, and it wasn't right.
I couldn't not take it", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening here today... is the result of what happened in the past.
He must know it, see it, and grow into it.
Not only do we need to become better at activism and organizing, but we need to know the layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we need to do to liberate, to liberate ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't experience crude racism firsthand, she's no different than any other black woman-child.
I feel like I'm hurting her by protecting her from all of this".
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which had become something of a campground for activists, across from police headquarters, where they waited to talk about the issue that later resulted in Officer Darren Wilson not being charged.
There, Ferrell and her daughter contacted local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They packed bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism was completely transformed after August 9th", she said, noting that while a student at Missouri State University, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequity in the black community.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It just came to me".
Weeks later, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his director of photography, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or do you want to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism has been voiced by countless individuals in countless situations, usually white, who have come to a community to profit from its pain and its resistance...
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson couldn't be condensed, and we decided to do it differently".
Folayan had already contacted co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on behalf of death row inmates.
His involvement warmed Ferrell to the project, which the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting, along with six other area natives.
"This is not a documentary in which someone speaks for us or to us", said David.
"That's what was important to me, how these people were going to be represented because that's how I was going to be represented".
Folayan said, "While the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, he proved to be the most outspoken of the film's participants, as he demonstrated that the movement is "not about a messianic leader, it's about community coming together".
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
Laughing at his first glimpse of the finished product, Ferrell said, "I felt naked".
"But in doing this work and in humanizing black people, I realized there could be some sensitivity".
Ferrell's story also solidifies and re-centers the role of black lesbians in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which derived the slogan #BlackLivesMatter from social media following the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify as gay.
"Black lesbians in leadership have generally kept the movement alive", Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly at war on many fronts.
Black lesbians have to bear the brunt of it".
Folayan agreed, stating, "The movement is really sustained by black women and many gay black women".
However, Ferrell insists that "this is not some sort of affirmative action" and that he was not chosen because of his identity.
"He was the one who set the energy in motion", she says.
"But it's no accident that she's on the front lines, because as a black lesbian woman, you have a lot to lose by living a life at these intersections.
You can feel his energy through the screen".
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras are long gone, but troubling racial connections remain between the community and the police.
Ferrell's on probation for another two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home as "chaotic".
And yet, Ferguson holds on to the song he wrote in his head three years before he hit the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round, it's flat!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, "The world is not round".
The world is flat.
They get people used to things like that by scaring them.
Oh, man, that's a lot of questions.
Because the more information you decode, the more information you get.
This is madness.
Is the world flat?
Or does it spin in a circle?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving said, "For years, I believed what I wanted to believe".
I thought the world was round and spinning.
You really think we're circling the solar system?
Nothing they send out comes back.
He's not coming back!
The information they're giving us is highly inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, has struggled this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaging 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York, there are many faces, white, black and brown, hanging from wires in the ceiling, each of which bears an almost unmistakable resemblance to the other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from ear sticks and cropped hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks, famously sent his cropped hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibit, which opens August 2nd, is called A Suitable Similitude.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combined her discipline with expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman and leading dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama three days before she left office.
By algorithmically analyzing the DNA extracted from Manning and creating 30 portraits using what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg revealed not only the tractability of the DNA data (that there are many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of interpretations) but also its identity with a rigorous, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but openly identified as a woman as a teenager, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six under the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
His image was suppressed by the prison, so that he had only one photograph: a gritty, black-and-white selfie of a visibly agitated Manning sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-yellow wig that matched his own.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was enjoying success with the massive success of her 2012 project Stranger Things.
In it, the artist produced portraits by scraping DNA from forensic debris like cigarette butts and chewing gum to paint a picture of what these people might have looked like.
That's when he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning when she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait that could accompany this article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibit.
She couldn't be visited or photographed during that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA profile done.
The artist and his imprisoned muse exchanged many letters over the course of two years, becoming unlikely pen pals.
They even produced Printed Images, a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, in which the president pardoned Chelsea's sentence and imagined a future in which she could see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama actually called for Manning's release just days after the book came out was a kind of happy coincidence that came after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
As Donald Trump wages war on government whistleblowers and transgender troops and finds new, tweetable ways to further fuel the sharp divisions he's been asked to heal, there's something deep and powerful about this exhibition opening right now.
When asked about the odd timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason".
An artist statement written on the gallery wall, with Manning's oversized signature beneath it (the "i" in her last name is dotted with a heart), called for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on "gender, race, sexuality and culture".
Across the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: lots of C's, G's and A's written in pencil...
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to convey how amazingly similar we all are, at least as biological creatures.
"What I hope people take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open to interpretation the genetic data is, how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, who was exhibiting her video work Simulated Memories in 2007.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and this is 30 of them".
The final piece in the exhibit, which is housed in a single room, is a page from the aforementioned short comic book.
Here's Manning walking out of the United States Disciplinary Barracks, King Kong style, with a speaker in his hand.
It says, "When they shut you down, they win".
"So never shut up".
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote me".
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibit in person (as he rather presciently imagined from the comic book), but when he does he will be greeted by masks, which are genetic replicas of himself, gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything in the exhibit, the genetic haplogroups were written in pencil up to Manning's height (5'2, Manning's height), which was done specifically.
Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits, "In the past I would have put them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd".
"I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement that was taking shape with Chelsea, as well as the movement behind her release".
A Northwestern instructor and an Oxford University employee are wanted for murder.
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University lecturer and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook County records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for first-degree murder without bail for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged role in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
An alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27th.
Officers responded to a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple deep lacerations to her body.
Official sources say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem was on administrative leave and barred from Northwestern University campuses.
Cubbage said, "This is a criminal case under investigation by the proper authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with that investigation".
Warren is a senior finance fellow at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville University said in an emailed statement, "We are in contact with UK police and stand ready to assist US investigating authorities in any way they need".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Communications for the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
Guglielmi said, "Police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to locate him are intensifying".
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police had just received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza, who had received a mysterious tip that something was going on in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as horrific.
Guglielmi also said it's unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
Guglielmi said, "We believe the victim had a relationship with faculty member Latham".
The management at the Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying, "Police are still working through the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
Italy has seized the German ship.
Italian police say the Iuventa, a search-and-rescue vessel in the central Mediterranean, was seized yesterday off the island of Lampedusa.
The police also shared with journalists the recordings of telephone conversations allegedly belonging to two members of the organization, announcing that this operation was carried out as part of an investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
Members of Jugend Rettet, who allegedly "also operate in favor of illegal migration on the Libya-Italy line", are alleged to have brought asylum seekers directly from boats of Libyan human traffickers to Italy on at least three occasions.
The members of Jugend Rettet questioned by the prosecution are alleged to have committed this crime in collaboration with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
In response, the organization issued a statement saying that their priority will continue to be to save human lives and that they are evaluating the charges against them.
In addition to the ships of the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about nine international NGOs are involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had drawn up a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations to follow, and they were required to sign it.
Last minute: 5 buffets of Banlı who attacked Büyükerşen were sealed
Tepebaşı Municipality sealed five buffets rented from TCDD by retired police officer Mahfuz Banlı, who was detained by police after the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yilmaz Büyükerşen and arrested by the court where they were removed.
According to Habertürk, the Municipality's teams were accompanied by a large number of police and SWAT teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "In the short term we will complete the WADA roadmap"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that it will not take long for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria to become operational again.
"A certain stage in the fulfillment of the roadmap criteria has been completed, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was reviewing the second part of the WADA Regulatory Compliance Roadmap, recently published on the institution's website, which outlines the criteria governing RUSADA's re-operation.
According to Mutko, it doesn't contain anything that would concern Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future".
However, one criterion mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the reported results of a WADA-approved alleged state-sponsored doping investigation into Russian sport conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Referring to the issue, Mutko said: "While our anti-doping system admits a failure, we are also conducting the investigation.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no state program, and we will not accept something that does not exist".
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russia's anti-doping bodies but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains contradictory positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept the report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2005 following a doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), this June testing was allowed to be planned and coordinated.
In July, following a visit to the agency's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to become operational again.
100 million people watched it!
Beşiktaş's "Come to Beşiktaş" video announcing the transfer of Negredo reached 100 million people from 18 countries in a short time.
The video, embellished with dialogues by Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared on the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The president of Galatasaray will not return empty-handed.
Former Galatasaray president Faruk Suren harshly criticized president Dursun Özbek, who went to Bucharest to convince Mircea Lucescu and to the capital Ankara for Ndiaye's transfer.
Here's what the legendary president had to say for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek meeting: "We were finishing when we left".
The President of Galatasaray doesn't leave empty-handed, nor does he return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray president does not go to footballer
The footballer comes to the President's feet.
Of course they meet, whether it's a kiss on the hand or a hug...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go near him.
You're giving 9 million euros to a player that Osmanlıspor bought for 300,000 euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested heavily, of course you'll play, and it'll be seven and a half, nine...
Özbek's actions: I do not want to criticize.
But the situation is clear.
G. Palace values are eroding.
It's not just football, it's everything.
It's the Court and the General Assembly that will change that.
But I understand the members are pleased!
Start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but the surveys weren't working.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, misleading.
Even though he pledged anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"It never had any consistency or objectivity", says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce hair-care company in San Francisco.
So he called in some outside help.
A new kind of human resources start-up is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
They produce and license software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct multiple-choice surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow employees to bypass senior management and go directly to the board of directors to report a malfunction.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City start-up that measures employee engagement through software analytics tools provided by companies, said, "There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is your company's Fitbit?"
Errett says that by using Glint, he has a better understanding of what his employees are thinking and feeling three years later.
It offers quick surveys and multiple-choice surveys to specific teams, as well as a heat map showing at a glance which departments of the company receive the most complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, so that the reasons for these can be tampered with.
Companies are beginning to understand that to avoid becoming the next Uber, they need to be knowledgeable about their workplace culture; Uber has been in a scandal ever since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassment environment where those who openly say what they think are punished.
For startups like Glint, this demand for oversight means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Convercent, a Denver Colorado-based start-up that helps companies detect and prevent bad behavior, increased amid controversy over Uber's discrediting earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed on as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct personalized "pulse" polls, collect real-time confidential responses, and generate heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous tip line where employees can report misconduct.
If the president is accused, complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said, "The court of public opinion has captured the regulators".
Quinlan said that if a company mistreats its employees or behaves unethically, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee layoffs, or lawsuits, even if regulators don't step in.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to keep its employees informed of policies and procedures and to provide easy access to company headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or an e-mail address associated with company headquarters, make a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, said these were often intimidating and uncomfortable experiences, not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from executives sitting across an office, city, or state - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices - can be identified and resolved faster.
Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said, "I can approach this employment experience with a more holistic, 360-degree view".
"We also protect our shareholders from corporate lawsuits".
After the collapse of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 2002 due to ethics violations stemming from the Enron scandal, companies took ethics, values, and employee relations more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media came to life", companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from going viral.
He said, "Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy".
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge recurring fees for use of their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that's been validated by the venture capitalists who back both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnected nature of companies, their cultures, and their need for venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's vice president of global benefits and employee experience, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said, "When people are happy to be at a company, when they feel their voices are heard, and their work is satisfying, they are more invested in making that company successful".
Investors make money when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when their employees are genuine and feel a sense of belonging.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee authenticity and sense of belonging, it's not surprising that they find support.
Having data on employee engagement is important to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the people in charge of the company don't act.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if that expectation isn't met quickly enough or at all, it can lead to frustration and make employees feel disconnected.
Russell Raath, who's the head of consulting at Kotter International, a management consulting firm, saw that companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection, and he said, "If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations".
"Because if you don't follow up, employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported at Glint.
And after gathering feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to help solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights into its own employees, and hopes that in the long run, this will translate into being able to retain more workers in this type of industry, which is known to have high employee turnover.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people".
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose businesses".
It's been a long day for the Bruins with the NCAA canceling two practices a day.
It's 11:00 at night, and a group of UCLA football players are hanging out on the sidelines of the team's new on-campus practice facility.
Some have stripped off their jerseys, revealing backs slick with sweat from the rigors of the first day of training camp.
For a significant portion of the team, these free minutes constitute their lunch break.
After three hours of practice, the players enrolled in summer classes will return to their dorms and study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings the following morning at 6:30.
"The next three days are torture for these guys", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning Monday to Tuesday.
Designed to take the pressure off the players, the NCAA's elimination of two practices a day actually lengthened their days, at least until the finals end on Friday.
So UCLA's first three practices are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already tight schedules.
Instead of two practices a day, it's more like one; the Bruins are moving the start of camp up nearly a week from last season, and are practicing during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to train 18 times through August 20 before preparing for their official opener against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, even though it adds new pens to the players' busy training schedule.
"We put a huge load on them for three or four days", said Mora, "and it's very demanding".
"And they've been through this recently; they work, they're great kids.
I think we'll have more time when we come on Saturday, it'll be really great".
UCLA will stop training when camp is over, which is no easy task considering the adjacent parking lot and adjacent Luskin Center, a luxury hotel that's been pelted with soccer balls and covered with a protective net behind the goal, stretch across the line of sight of their field.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel beginning this week, but Mora acknowledges there may be a problem with these rooms becoming vacant during the season.
Mora said, "We'll have security".
"It's a real concern, and it's not far-fetched to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and videotape a workout.
If you have a video of a practice, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
Facebook increases its story verification power to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third-party story verifiers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday as it tries to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on the firm's website, they said they would use updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to story verifiers, potentially showing the story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with French voters facing a flood of fake news ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts ahead of elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new story verification feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook's news feed product manager, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more sources about what they're reading and sharing to make informed decisions".
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "related article" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating comics: the story of a castle in England
In its recent past, tiny Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a broom-haired Yorkshireman with a passion for historical documentation, Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the valley of the River Bewl in Kent.
"I think it's beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years", he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection it is to hold this letter in my hand".
Spanning from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, A Castle in England documents families who lived in Scotney, with each story being painted by a different named artist from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: she also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a project she found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"I've even had my eyes gouged out by a fingerprint on the side of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the King James supporters".
"That was his thumbprint!
And the letters always stink because back then you had a fire for light.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes him feel like he's there.
Oh, I like the archives!"
As someone who loves old papers, having support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and being able to spend almost four months in a castle ("To be honest, I overstayed my welcome by staying a little longer than I should have") seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" Victorian-era castle, combing through archives, and studying its many treasures and antiques, such as hyena heads mounted on the mansion's walls and bottles that had spent centuries in ditches.
He toured the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he would "drink whiskey and write".
Scotney's detailed history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had barely begun to handle the archive, which he describes as "centuries of aristocrats saying, 'Oh, throw him in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British empire, maps marking the boundaries of who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree over which two families fought.
Forget about it, man!"
Some stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point for a broader introduction to English history, including The Labourer, who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"In this book, The Knights Families of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"The Peasants' Revolt had started nearby and I thought a revolt would be a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family who hid a Jesuit priest for 7 years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, featuring 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who allegedly stuffed a coffin with stones and staged his own funeral (a revelation made years later when his coffin was exhumed).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite Scotney family: "These gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooked, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Over the generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying rich older women; I imagine them as a bunch of handsome men with a knack for wooing heiresses".
Rhodes, having completed his tour of duty at the fort, seeks other singular writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week assignment for a comic about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place in her heart.
She says, "I was sad to leave".
"It's like, 'Oh, now I have to go and face fucking reality.'"
'Maho' reaction to Meral Akşener
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) General Secretary İsmet Büyükataman made a written statement regarding the recent resignation claims regarding the MHP in social media and the press.
Büyükataman used the expression that "hatred flowed" to the MHP from social media and "from the corners of some old rifle Marxists", claiming that "games and machinations were resorted to to prevent the nationalist movement from continuing to exist under the MHP roof after September 12".
The great man, he said:
"Those who can't digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who can't stand the Turkish homeland, even if they have a corrupt record, a swollen criminal file, their ideology is blurred, their mind is confused, they rub their hands".
410 members of the MHP Kocaeli Gölcük Provincial Organization and 215 members of the MHP Bursa Yenişehir Provincial Organization have resigned.
250 resignations, 300 resignations, and so on, to mislead the public.
In the columns of the newspapers lies abound, deception deepens.
We have not received a single resignation, and the number of beneficiaries in the aforementioned places does not exceed the fingers of one hand.
Describing the resignations as "so-called", Büyükataman said that the opinion polls, which he also referred to as "so-called", were an attempt to mislead the public and manipulate perceptions.
Büyükataman said, "Their propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating a perception against the MHP will backfire".
Saying that MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, MHP General Secretary Büyükataman said the following about the resignations:
The sword of the former Marxists is not enough to destroy the MHP's place in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
Behind all the commentary, behind all the perception management methods, is a dirty calculation.
Because politics and the media have set their sights on the MHP base.
It makes no sense to us that those who did not work for our party when they were among us should resign now.
Those who can't benefit from our party at their own expense have resigned.
People who have never done anything good for the MHP, who have never shared our memories, who have never understood our countries, who have never joined our struggle, and even if they do, they should find something else to do.
The efforts of those who cannot tolerate the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party to foment discord and seek factionalism are a futile effort.
And it will inevitably backfire on its owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish nation that has stood upright despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, Büyükataman called those he claimed were targeting the MHP "political counterfeiters", "political kidnappers", and said, "The nationalist movement is not ownerless".
He said, "Rooted and nurtured from across the ocean, the external forces within will not achieve their goal at any cost".
MHP's Büyükataman, who used the phrase "Tasmalı traitors will go crazy and will be ashes in the fire of hatred", listed the opposition parties and terrorist organizations together in his statement and claimed: "From CHP to HDP; from there to Perinçekgil, from PKK to FETÖ".
Yesterday, we resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned Turkey without MHP, MHP without Türkeş; We fought to the end with the bastards who wanted a government without MHP, a Parliament without MHP.
Now we're gonna ruin the games, make the players miserable.
"The patent of nationalism is with the MHP", Büyükataman said, alluding to Meral Akşener and using the following statements: "Just like in an old Greenwich film, Banker Bilo, Maho said he would take the villagers to Germany, and after driving them in a truck for days, he left them on a mountain slope in Istanbul.
That's their business, but all we're asking these people to do is go somewhere new.
Kjaer has signed for Sevilla.
Kjaer, who was transferred from the yellow-and-blue team to Sevilla for 12.5 million Euros and went down in history as the most expensive defensive transfer of the Spanish team, has signed an official contract.
The Danish star will wear the number 4 shirt in Seville.
Big relief from THY for families with babies
According to a statement from THY Press Advisory, the national airline, which puts the comfort and satisfaction of its passengers at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", prepared by examining the needs of infants between 0-2 years of age and their families, began to be offered to passengers traveling with infants on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit, which comes in a specially designed bag, includes a diaper change, a disposable feeding apron, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a newborn wet cotton handkerchief, and a breast pad.
Paraben-free, alcohol-free, paint-free, and free of harmful chemicals, the products are designed with the baby's delicate skin in mind.
Washington is changing the rules on green cards.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said there will be a new US immigration plan that changes the Green Card rules.
It calls for cutting legal immigration to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-based visas.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates who have self-sufficient financial resources and skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
The authors commented on the match Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz
Kadıköy had regained the enthusiasm and splendor that I had not found or seen for two seasons.
A team with a "barbecue heart" that Aykut Kocaman brought out in his absence was on the field to make a "stand behind us" agreement with his fan.
We can criticize his play or his positioning or his performances, but I haven't seen a game that's been this engaging and this searching in a long time.
He showed it in the first game, but yesterday he put his own shoulder on the shoulder; Fenerbahce's field commander now Valbuena.
His age was a problem when he transferred, but Big had what he called "a never-give-up attitude".
30 years ago, we gave the naming rights to the atomic ant to Reza Çalımbay.
If he succeeds, it will be the most fitting tribute to the French actor.
He's been all over the field, he's been involved in all the passing arrangements, he's always been in charge, and he's put on a big show for his short stature by scoring a goal.
Alper's playing in front, remaining in the position of second striker, left the Sturm Graz team "limited" in the field for a long time.
With Fenerbahce closing the period without a corner, they were constantly looking for a formula to overcome such a hard wall.
They've got the ball, but they can't make an effective pass into the opponent's penalty area.
This may be interpreted as a "need a center", but we're looking at a game that's hesitant to pass to Ahmethan, a game that can't get its only center into position.
Either the team doesn't trust the young player, or his performance needs to improve.
They missed two clear chances after the score was 1-1.
It was important for them to get through the round, but it would have made the night even better to have this fan standing up and applauding the players' struggle and shouting "goal".
There'll probably be one or two more transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahce needs number 12...
We're on the verge of a very bright and cheerful season with this style of play that's captured the hearts of those in the stands who are trying to get ahead.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is setting up its harness, he needs more time.
Physically, they're in good shape.
The quality of play will improve.
You can clearly see the confidence of all the players on the pitch.
They need last night's applause to turn over a new leaf.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned.
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder, a new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry comes out.
Yeah, I know.
Sexbots are big right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robot Science (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type.
Commenting on the release of the new report, Mr. Sharkey said: "People kind of laugh at them, but companies are actually doing a lot of referrals, and we're going to see more of them".
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable counterparts to robots with silicone skin that is warm to the touch, with specifically human-like responses performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robot to suit their own tastes by choosing everything from the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and nail type or color.
But with so many robots with personalities to make a Stepford wife look innovative, it's even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to customize their own robots based on character traits they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including the shy "Frijit Farrah" and the "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurer" personality.
True Companion's website enthuses: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as closely as possible".
So it likes what you like, it doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
They also have moods during the day, just like real people.
He may be sleepy, eager to talk, or "all business".
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human interactions, but the overly submissive female personality traits, the rape connotations when approaching Frijit Farah, are the most thought-provoking.
On its website, True Companion describes Roxxxy as a vibrator, but for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" states the website.
But these sex robots aren't just a fetish or a sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to sexual desire through subjugation as an optional extra.
Many men will not naturally own sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are currently on the periphery of consumer culture.
However, what leaks through the cracks can be highly instructive regarding the times in which we live.
Most people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
With a president in the White House boasting about sexually assaulting women, it's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots come at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide.
What's creepy about The Handmaid's Tale TV series isn't the graphic depictions, the hooked bodies or the gouged eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical resemblance to real women (in the proportions of porn movie stars, of course) as technologically possible.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch and to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", robots clearly don't represent real women.
They can't separate or leave their wives.
There are no activities or backstories, nothing to suggest independence or break the fantasy of total enslavement.
In other words, they're pleasure slaves.
Or, as we say in 2017, concubines.
Attack on US military convoy: dead and wounded...
A suicide attack in the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
One NATO soldier and three civilians were killed in the blast, which also wounded five American soldiers in the convoy and a translator working with NATO forces.
In an official statement by NATO's Resolute Support forces in Afghanistan, it was stated that a suicide bomber detonated a homemade explosive during a joint patrol mission of NATO forces with the Afghan National Army.
The wounded personnel are being treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
The wounded are in no immediate danger.
Local media reported that the suicide bomber was a Taliban member.
Trump's big move?
Making Mitt Romney look like a paragon of common sense.
The micro-scale of the political divide that polarizes the US electorate, dividing families, has become the reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers across the United States were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We all strive to burst our so-called filter bubbles.
Less talked about is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has had a falling out with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone he knows, including his Republican brother with whom he's argued about policy for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
That's a good thing at the dinner table, of course, but it seems to me that in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left has been reinvigorated by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency has created a push to the right for all of us.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrifying possibility that one day his bizarre behavior will no longer be shocking.
There's an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who defy his standards and suddenly seem like the epitome of sanity.
I find myself nostalgic for Mitt Romney's bizarre version of insanity these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are really very minor offenses according to Trump.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican nominee only needs to be sane to be judged to have made immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel run by the New York City Parks Department and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are gigantic, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder (all clowns making funny faces and animals turned to look over their shoulders in fear) and the jingling music are strangely exhilarating.
In other words, many of the stereotypes of a city can be disappointing: the views of tall buildings become boring, the skyline becomes too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach the dreamer.
Thirty-five years on, and I still can't quite get over the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage wasn't actually a Swiss cottage (theme bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count) but a vast roundabout in North London.
However, the carousel in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, such that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go there and all have a great time.
If I could give the merry-go-round a grade, I'd give it a perfect score, but thankfully, no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was asked to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars before passing on my credit card at a garage sale.
Same thing at the coffee shop on my street corner, with an option to match the note with a 15% tip for whatever was purchased over the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be an impartial exchange, but also to put pressure on the server to personalize an event that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman in Bonmarche stood there grinning apologetically, I gave five stars to the experience of handing her a credit card in exasperation.
They put on their bathing suits when the temperature rose above 41 degrees .
In Tunceli, one of the hottest days of the season, people flocked to the beaches of Munzur.
Since noon, young, children, old, women and men who entered the beaches along the Munzur River tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling off in the ice-cold water.
Especially because Tunceli citizens living in countries such as Germany, Holland, France and England spent their holidays in their homeland instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean, the beaches along the Munzur River were full.
Suna Tosun, who was among those who cooled down at Munzur Beach, stated that she preferred Tunceli instead of western cities for vacation, "I did not want to spend my vacation in the west to cool down with my family in Munzur, it was better to stay in our own land".
"Munzur's ice-cold water is like nowhere else in the world, Munzur cools us in these temperatures", he said.
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said that they preferred the Munzur River in Tunceli to the beaches of Çeşme or Bodrum and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists that prison officials said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed a previous verdict of manslaughter.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he killed Steenkamp by shooting her repeatedly through a bathroom stall door at her home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he had mistaken his girlfriend for someone who had sneaked into his cabin at night.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to appeal once again against Pistorius's six-year sentence, which they feel is too lenient this time.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to the South African High Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces up to 15 years in prison if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first Hajj caravan has departed.
Haj candidates who will go to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of Religious Affairs were dismissed with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
The ceremony, held at the External Lines Terminal, was attended by about 200 pilgrim candidates as well as their relatives and citizens.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) distributed roses to pilgrims going to the holy land with a scheduled flight.
The Haj caravan in Ankara was dismissed from Esanboga.
The convoy also included martyrs and martyrs' relatives who benefited from the practice of "hajj for veterans and martyrs' relatives" implemented for the first time this year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
According to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on charges of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
They were released the same day while the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and still impose severe penalties on those caught resting in non-reserved areas.
There will be checks throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court may impose a fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
AT THE beginning of July, 22-year-old Joey Hoffman and two friends went to Turkey for a vacation.
Joey Hoffman went missing on July 8 in Silifke after driving around Adana and Mersin in a rented car.
When her friends couldn't reach Hoffman despite all their calls, she contacted her family in Holland.
While police searched for the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
Printed and distributed by
Robin Hoffman, who is here appealing to the police, printed missing persons notices to find her brother and distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman said they last heard from her brother on July 8th.
Then I came to Turkey with two friends, and we went to the police here.
So far, we haven't heard anything or found any clues.
He said, "We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until we hear from him".
Congratulations to Ayşe Ceren from the Second World
At the 2017 World Youth Championships in Palette Swimming held in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş finished second in the world over 400 meters.
Osman Aşkın Bak, Minister of Youth and Sports, congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş for winning the silver medal.
On the first day of the 2017 Palette Swimming Youth World Championships in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş came second in the world over 400 meters.
Ceren missed out on the gold medal by just 27 seconds as she took her place on the second podium with a stunning performance on the track where she competed with 8 finalists.
In the 400 metres, Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal with a time of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Eight male and eight female athletes represent Turkey in the championship.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying.
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far claimed 30 lives, was a man who called his mother at the time of the fire and said, "I don't want to die, Mum, it's not fair".
Italian Gloria Trevisan, who said, "Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye".
Among the dozens of people unaccounted for after the fire were 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and her Italian boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family, who live in northern Italy, said in a statement that they had received confirmation from British authorities that both young men had died.
The lawyer said that the families of the young people are experiencing great pain and asked the journalists not to insist on getting an explanation about this.
I think I'm going to die. Bye, mom.
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria called her mother, Emanuela Trevisan, on her cell phone shortly after the fire, and that she cried when she listened to her mother's last recorded conversations.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours following the fire, which started around 1:00 a.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was said to be calmer in his first speeches, said, "Mother, bad things are happening here, there's a fire".
We're trapped in here, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting for rescue.
"We tried to open the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working", he reportedly said.
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, who became increasingly worried as the fire grew, were reportedly:
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I'm going to die.
I had a whole life ahead of me; it's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I won't be able to hold you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. Goodbye, mother.
I'm going to heaven now and I'll help you from there.
It's the fault of the Italian government.
Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who both studied architecture, moved to London in March from the northern region of Veneto after graduating last year and struggling to find work.
Gloria Trevisan, who had been able to find only a 300-euro-a-month job in her country, was soon working in London for 1,800 pounds (about 2,060 euros) a month.
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria Trevisan's family was going through financial difficulties and that she had gone to London to help them.
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately", he said.
The tragedy of Italy, unable to provide jobs for its youth
Loris Trevisan, Gloria's father, expressed his anger: "It is the fault of our government that forces our young people to flee abroad to find work".
In Italy, the unemployment rate is 12 percent, and among young people, it is over 40 percent.
To compound the problem, in recent years many young Italians have begun emigrating to other European countries, especially England.
Last year alone, more than 110,000 young people were forced to leave Italy because of unemployment.
Italian media commented on the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi, saying it was a tragedy for a country unable to provide jobs for its youth.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate IBS
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products may help alleviate the symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable medical condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's essential amino acid tryptophan aids the development of immune cells that develop a resilient gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to prevent foodborne germs from sneaking into the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote endurance, protecting delicate tissue from damage.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, inflammation can result in bowel disease.
In experiments, mice carrying a specific bacterium in their gut were found to produce a type of immune cell that promotes endurance.
And bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna said: 'We have established a link between Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacterial species that is part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a cell population that promotes resistance.'
Mice with more tryptophan in their diets had more of these immune cells".
If the same thing happens in humans, he suggested, a diet rich in L. reuteri and tryptophan could promote a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
Her postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, was working on a type of immune cell that promotes resilience when she discovered that one group of lab mice had these types of cells, but another group of the same species kept in a different location did not.
He suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice, in other words, the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
They sequenced the DNA of the guts of the mice, and they found that the mice that had immune cells had six types of bacteria, but the mice that didn't have immune cells didn't have any.
Mice that lacked a gut microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell because they were looked after in a sterile environment were given L. reuteri and immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of this liquid, which is free of bacteria, into immature immune cells taken from mice.
Immune cells turned into cells that promote endurance.
The active ingredient, when purified from the liquid, turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have the same resistance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us harbor L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop in humans as they do in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control inflammation in the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially in cases where L. reuteri is present, high levels of tryptophan cause this population to spread".
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic.
The £40 million transfer from Chelsea began in United's final pre-season match, a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and saw Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira take up the position of holding forward while attacking as they pleased.
However, Matic, who was left out of the Maviler's pre-season tour of Asia, had a serious lack of match fitness and only managed 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted this needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, the genius of his way of thinking, he thinks about football".
"We'll help her get ready sooner".
As Mourinho began to shape his starting eleven for the start of the season, like Matic, new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also made appearances at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants three more transfers, but the club insists he has already done an "outstanding job" in completing three of his four priority transfers.
He added, "I thank the club for taking three out of four".
"I'd be happier if they got four out of four, but they worked really hard for me".
Last year, 197 people were sent to the hospital.
ACCORDING to the Swedish Institute for Social Welfare, the diagnosis of gender dysphoria has increased from 1 in 100,000 in 2005 to 8 in 100,000 in 2015.
The Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital has received 197 referrals in the past year, mostly children and adolescents who were unhappy with their birth gender.
Lousise Frisen, a child psychiatrist at the same hospital, said that the increase could be due to becoming a more open society: "Openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society".
Gender dysphoria is not known to be related to sexual orientation.
Drugs operation in Izmir
Ödemiş County Police Directorate's Smuggling and Organized Crime Bureau teams conducted an operation at the home of 36-year-old F.T. in Ülker Sokak, 3 Eylül neighborhood.
A search of the house yielded 33 ecstasy pills and a delicate scale.
F.T., who jumped from the balcony and tried to escape, was caught and taken into custody.
F.T. is scheduled to be arraigned in court following his arraignment.
Transferred to Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams in the Süper Lig, has signed winger Turgut Doğan Şahin, who played for Kasımpaşa last season.
According to a statement from the yellow-and-black club, the 29-year-old winger has signed a 2-year contract as part of the transfer process.
"Winger Turgut Doğan Şahin, who played for Kasımpaşa, has signed a two-year contract.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor". were used.
A British inventor has implanted himself with a microchip that allows him to enter his home and car with a wave of his hand.
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in his body, enabling him to open his front door, access his office, and even start his car with a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and finger and now offers the service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be performed to medical standards, Winchester collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to the microchip implanted in cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also modify locks on homes and vehicles to be compatible with the chip at a cost of £300 per key.
The man, who is married and the father of a child, had this technology installed in both his home and his BMW Z4 so that he could operate the car with his hands on the wheel.
The White House show cost the taxpayers thousands.
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter over the south lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention at the July 17 White House launch of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products manufactured in all 50 states.
It was displayed alongside a helicopter from Connecticut, a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter; the White House War Room requested the helicopter's presence by an individual order (also called FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn for "unusual" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an email to his superior, the Deputy Commandant of Marine Corps Aviation, the day before the event, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization".
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The memo added that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be required for the return flight due to duty time limitations.
While unit security personnel stood inside the aircraft while it was on the ground, the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event.
It is unclear from the recordings provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 investigated whether the organization violated that provision.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked was whether he had violated the Hatch Act, and we were told he had not".
"Looks like you're locked out", the XO replied.
The "Made in America" organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and is not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even formal organizations have political implications.
At the event, the president referred to the healthcare reform efforts underway in the senate at the time and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents are supposed to use them to travel.
But it's unusual to be officially asked to use them just for a photo opportunity.
Trump gained attention in February when Air Force One went behind the scenes of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with messages about his predecessor's use of Air Force One.
White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibit, with products made by American workers from all 50 states with American materials".
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights over the Washington area and practice dropping the President of the United States on the South Lawn with a point-blank shot at the White House.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
An official said the flight for the Made in America organization was part of the aircrew's training needs for that month.
Unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers weren't charged for any other tricks involved in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said their company was not involved in arranging the display of the helicopter on the south lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact expense incurred by the organization.
But according to the DoD's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD's VH-3D meet rate is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit logs show the aircraft flew approximately 30 minutes each way from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual operating cost of the helicopter is far less than that.
Walters said, "It's very misleading to taxpayers to base an expense on recovery rate estimates".
"These rate estimates include sunk costs in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses".
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs but do include fuel, maintenance, and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of the helicopter for the event.
Spicer said, "The idea here is to showcase what's being done in America this week".
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs depend on it.
And like most Americans, I think we're all very proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So of course it's appropriate to highlight that".
It's unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as it circled the south lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about the company's products in his fleet.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well, I have three of them".

According to the U.N., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women.
The head of the U.N.'s mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can be representative if all segments of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy head of the U.N. Assistance Mission, says hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against the election process, which comes at a time when international military operations have become more of a consultative role.
This year's elections mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women will contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million registered voters.

GMB is concerned about McVitie's investment in the Glasgow plant.
A union is seeking assurances from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's that they will be given a long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross area.
More than 500 people work at the factory, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, says they've invested more than £5 million in the area over the last few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to know" if there was a change in their operations.
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland demanded that McVitie's "address its concerns that funding is not being provided for the modernisation of its production lines".
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "It is deeply concerning to our members that we are unable to see any clarity from the facility's general manager on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tollcross.
Families have worked here for generations and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical pillar of adequate employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a job, pay and welfare perspective, the circumstances of Brexit, rising costs of living and chronic production decline mean that there is an urgent need for a four-headed production presence at McVitie's in Glasgow's east end".
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The plant manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting at Tollcross two months ago with employees and GMB representatives, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
At that time, we told our employees that, like all companies doing business in a highly competitive and uncertain economic environment, we were constantly reviewing our operations in order to remain competitive, which is true for all of our businesses and facilities.
He added: "We have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross facility in recent years, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and if there are any changes to our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Necip and Utku are in Beşiktaş for another 4 years
Beşiktaş Club has extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
On the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), in the section containing data about footballers, it was seen that Beşiktaş extended the contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black-and-white team and signed his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, began to wear the uniform in the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who rose to the team captain, played a total of 254 official matches with Beşiktaş.
The TFF website also contains information that the goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, whom Beşiktaş included in the squad last season as a rental, has signed a contract with him until May 31, 2021.
According to Utku's website, he was released from his provisional transfer status on 1 August 2017 and his licence was renewed on 2 August.
Utku Yuvakuran played for Beşiktaş in the Under-21 League last season.
The young goalkeeper participated in only 2 Turkish Cup matches in the black and white jersey.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer that triggered his £189 million release clause, but have they warned Barcelona about breaking the world record set three years ago?
The sensational offer set the summer transfer window in motion, with the Ligue 1 side poised to break the world transfer record by more than doubling the previous amount when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
PSG's offer of a £500,000-a-week after-tax salary suggests that Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-earning professional athlete when the transfer is completed.
Although a source close to the Catalans' management insists that the club has always done its best to keep an eye on him since his arrival from Santos in 2013, Barcelona are known to be angry about the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
But was the football world warned of this scenario three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to all clubs interested in signing one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be against them, we will contact their players".
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, there will be consequences".
Spanish club Barcelona seems to have crossed that line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona are feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their biggest assets, Neymar.
The penalty for preventing the reading of the Sala has been overturned.
The defendants Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yilmaz, who allegedly tried to prevent Mustafa Baki, the Imam of Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque, from reciting ezan and sela, were charged with "knowingly and willingly helping the organization despite not being a member", "resisting not to perform duty" and "insulting" Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
Taking into account the fact that the victim withdrew her complaint and the manner in which the crime was committed, the court decided to impose a fine of 7 thousand liras on the accused Gülşen for "insulting a public official due to his duty", and sentenced the accused Yilmaz to one year in prison for "resisting not to perform his duty".
The panel decided to commute Yilmaz's prison sentence to a fine of 6 thousand liras.
After the two defendants were fined, their lawyers filed an appeal.
The case will be examined at the Istanbul District Court 23.
He came to the Department of Corrections.
After completing its investigations, the chamber decided to reject in principle the appeal application of accused Kenan Gülşen on the grounds that the sentence for "insult" was applied in the legal context, the action was qualified as correct and corresponded to the type of crime provided for in the law.
According to the High Criminal Court, when the accused Nait Yilmaz met the imam Mustafa Baki, who came out of the mosque after reciting sala, he said, "You are throwing the nation into the street".
The president has been taken.
"This case is over", he said, adding that his act of attempting to walk on him and hit him caused the victim to be unable to read the adhan and prayers that he was supposed to read at certain intervals.
Although the local court stated the reasons for the act, the chamber stated that the act took place when the victim finished the prayer and recitation of the adhan and informed the public in front of the mosque, the chamber noted that in the concrete case, there was no duty that the victim began or continued to perform, without discussing whether this act constituted the crime of attempting to injure the victim because of the public duty he performed and without explaining and showing how the defendant's admission that the victim tried to prevent the duties to be performed later was achieved.
The Chamber stated that the accused has no criminal record, the victim has not suffered any material damage due to the crimes attributed to the accused, and the moral damage does not constitute an obstacle to the application of the judgment.
SENTENCE WAS CANCELED, FILE RETURNED Considering the appeal claims of the defendant Nait Yilmaz's lawyer on these grounds, the chamber decided to cancel the verdict against the accused and return the case to the court of first instance.
Six Europeans on Interpol's list of known suicide bombers
The German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (International Police Organization) sent a list of 173 potential suicide bombers to law enforcement agencies in European countries last May.
The 132 people on the list are reportedly from Iraq, North Africa, the Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six people on the list are said to be European citizens.
They reportedly came from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Bosnia.
In Germany, it was reported that the person with ISIL connections was a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
In the fall of 2012, he traveled first to Egypt, then Turkey, and finally to Syria.
In mid-July, ISIS announced on its social media accounts that he had died in Raqqa.
The German Security Service did not respond to the newspaper's questions on the subject.
It was alleged that the names on Interpol's list were captured in operations against Daesh in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, American intelligence services examined the list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol reportedly sent the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
Die Welt, citing German security sources, reported that ISIS may try to send some of the names on the list to Europe to carry out suicide attacks.
The horror of sending off a soldier with a pump-action shotgun: 5-year-old Yıldızsu could lose her eye
In Job, young men shed blood as they bid farewell to soldiers.
A large group of people had gathered in the park in the Caradolap neighborhood the night before to bid farewell to their comrades who were going to be drafted.
Allegedly, M.K. and Ö.A., who were in the group, fired into the air from time to time with shotguns.
After the soldier's farewell, the group began to disperse.
M.K. was passing a playground full of kids when he fired a shotgun into the ground.
Five people, including a child sitting on a park bench, were injured by falling debris.
That moment was captured on the park's security cameras.
Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balkir, Yıldızsu Unus and İnci Kaya were transported to nearby hospitals by ambulances.
One of the injured, 5-year-old Yıldızsu Unus, is at risk of losing his left eye.
Yıldızsu's grandmother, Meryem Kaya, told DHA about that time.
Kaya said that the incident happened while she was holding her grandson, "The celebration of soldiers began at 20.00".
It took two hours.
The fun of soldiering is over.
The young people are beginning to disperse.
We were supposed to get up when it was over.
That's when the gun went off, right in front of me.
My granddaughter is not well.
There's an 80-90% chance he'll lose his eye.
We talked to the doctor, that's what he said.
They took one of the crap out and the other one's in your eye.
He said, "She's had one surgery, maybe she'll have 10".
The suspects M.K. and O.A. were arrested and detained by the teams of the Provincial Directorate of Police.
After questioning by the police, the two men were arrested and taken to court.
