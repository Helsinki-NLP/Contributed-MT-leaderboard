This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that had previously been popular, but provides explanations that fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The animal's feathers are light brown on top and pale yellow or orange on the underside, the scientists said.
This finding also contributes to the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a developed shaft called a frill, nor did they have the characteristics of feathers - spines and small hairs - the researchers found that the frill was probably a later evolutionary development, which is another feature.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight except for temperature regulation or display.
Researchers have suggested that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows juvenile plumage and not juvenile feathers.
A car bomb exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which corresponds to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversal.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Milky Way.
The effect that the team was looking for may be due to the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon strikes the Earth, causing ripples, the Milky Way exerts a powerful force on the galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that one dark matter affects another dark matter, like regular matter.
The theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is located around the ring-like galaxy and is made up of many small components.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: Voters hide in a room, drop a pre-printed sheet with their choice of candidate into an envelope.
After the authorities verify the identity of the voters, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and marks the voting list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are allowed except those of legally counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness any part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision following certain procedures.

Other issues reported include the future status of Palestine, which both nations fear, as well as the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary insect control experiment had to be closely supervised by mounted riflemen, so that the experiment could be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooters Association's Hunting Program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, Chief Park and Heritage Conservation Superintendent with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed training and health guidelines.
Martelly was sworn in at a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission ordered the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Martelly Commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protesters were provoked by the failure to hold elections, which were due in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional heating issues, which the company deemed "not serious".
The ministry called the delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday afternoon).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management says no damage has been reported to the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that no tsunami signals were observed.
A former Philippine police officer kidnaps a Hong Kong passenger bus in Manila, Philippines, and holds them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released today along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then posed as the elderly woman, who was trying to go to the bathroom, and shot her dead.
Loggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
She trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and started work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Loggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
Her research found that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the completion of six embryos.
Government investigators recovered the flight recorders' two black boxes on Wednesday, Geneva reported.
And the men did to him according to all that his father had done.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldstein" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I was...maybe even more so...I love her and will miss her...I wish she was in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should be a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of people surveyed agreed that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never become a democracy.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle swimming events in three heats at the Goodwill Games, but her fitness was in doubt due to complaints.
He can't take the medication he needs to relieve his pain because he's banned from the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number on January 25.
Several people have confirmed his discovery since early February using different hardware and software, with the discovery announced on Tuesday.
Comets may potentially be the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists wish to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last year legalizing same-sex marriage.
She called the rumors "reckless and foolish".
He is thought to be a candidate for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year while also reducing carbon emissions.
The system uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the earlier ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport has been laid and trains on the ground will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or park and ride facilities on the ground.
Fears of transportation shortages have been raised by the possibility that the game will be pushed behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, a process believed to take a long time, due to a cross between Darwin's native species, Geospiza fortis, and the migratory cactus species, Geospiza coniferensis.
Gold is changed to any other thing, and every alloy is changed to gold.
It can also be hammered and has the characteristic torque.
It can also be very thin, and can be made of other metals. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted photographs in books called illuminated copies.
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red roast water.
The color of barbecue sauce changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
And thou shalt beat [some] of it to powder, and put [some] of it upon powder, and pour it into a shake, and it shall be clean.
The moisture on your hands reflects off the outer layers, which makes you feel funny and creates a kind of skin rash.
Near the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, each house had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage have been found in the Greek cities of Crete, Santorini, and Minano.
Chests of drawers also existed in ancient Egypt, Iran, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite contacts space and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of the light we see.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a large rocket needs an altitude of more than 100 feet.
Tourism has changed the world in unacceptable ways. The biggest thing that tourism has done for us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are many medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to animals and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including kittens) that eat very small prey such as insects, cockroaches and chickens.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, the special job each cat has to keep it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult males plus three females and fish.
Women are often closely related to each other and have large families of sisters and daughters.
The lion's prey behaves like a wolf or a dog's prey, the animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
A good leopard can climb (though not well), swim, run long distances, and kill with five times the strength of a strong man.
The leopard is not like the lion, neither is the fierce lion, nor is the fierce lion like the jaguar: [but] they roar.
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the voice of the fierce lion.
Wild American leopards love to eat small animals. They prey on deer, snakes, chickens, and chickens when possible. Almost all animals that prey on squirrels are much smaller than this.
Scientists think that oscillators find animals (prey) by smell because they are on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and are also very good at camouflage.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population to which they belong (for example if they move to a mountain range or the sea, or if they move to a new island where they can easily return again) they will experience a different environment compared to the previous one.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it was.
The native population has not changed at all, they need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they become less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called a species.
We call this process metamorphosis, which simply means the formation of a new species. Metamorphosis is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and plants take up the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants derive their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat a lot of food from plants, and without plants, animals can't survive.
They were swift of foot, they turned not when they went; they went every one straight before them:
Its elongated jaw was studded with over 70 razor-like teeth, with an extra set carved into the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing could escape its path.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a barbed tongue, and its diet included squid, large fish, other types of mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It would also have attacked anything in the water; not even a giant squid like T. rex would have been able to match it.
While much of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual items for the celebration including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their meals while sitting in their seats, the rich men liked to have a feast where they sat together while eating.
In later centuries, ancient Roman cuisine did not include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had never tasted fennel, nor had the potato, the Roman eggplant, the cuckoo, or any ancient Roman.
and for all the gods of the peoples that are round about them, every one according to his name, and according to the house of his god, did they build unto him:
And they brought the burnt-offerings to the house of their gods; and the priests offered them, and the people ate.
Each temple had an open courtyard for worship and a sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples.
And the house, that is, the temple before it, was called the house of Jehovah.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not very important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyards, and the storehouses had open counters in the windows, and the houses were built of stone.
For there is no cedar in the land; for the price of cedar is high.
Greenland was settled independently. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and found Greenland while travelling west and named it Greenland.
(And in those days there dwelt Asshur and Asshurim in the land.)
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Either way, it's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the notice, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". At the bottom of the document, the reverse text appears.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, large parchment paper (3‚ÅÑ4 by 1‚ÅÑ2 by 29 by 24 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that the sign was added only as an address.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them rather than fight the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way back to Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a large group of people living and working in the same society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civil, in which civis means citizen and civitas means city or city-state, though this also indicates the size of a society.
City-states are the progenitors of nations. A civic culture requires the transmission of knowledge across generations, perpetual cultural markers, and equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical artifacts and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a loose government under the Articles of Confederation - of which Congress was merely a component.
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial branch, it used state officials, who were often uncooperative, for all its actions.
It also had no authority to override tax laws between interstate tariffs.
Prior to the amendment, this required the consent of all states, and the states considered the federal government so irrelevant that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national football team, the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports, along with the Italian Winter Games, and the Olympic Games are the most popular in the northern regions.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" due to its geographical location.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introduced changes to native grain production practices, and recruited Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a Qing imperial city.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1895-1894), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures called the Antihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Columns.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and reconstruction continues today.
For example, the world's most prevalent still photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, being 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this mold is said to be 3:2 (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or nearly equal to this ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple recipe that creates wonder while maintaining order in the image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see for example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held European countries together, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
From the least of them even unto the greatest of them, every one is given to drink of the water of life freely.
A major tenet of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds exist specifically for this reason.
The church has been headquartered in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has made whether or not this principle has been put into practice questionable to many.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy began by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering all parts of the ocean, and was considered a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was a specific response to this tactic, Germany expected to receive a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and war crimes during World War I, countries tended to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had an elitist way of representing different periods of time. Each phase of China or each dynasty in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable period of divided city-states. The best known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
And in those times there was strife between the nobles and the rulers, and the kingdom was divided between them.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people were killed in a battle for the highest seat in the Great Hall in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, the office was open to all male applicants, allowing only the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the army because instead of ranking the army based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions as well.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this everyday life. He would go to meditate in a cave known as Hira on Mount Noor.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave appears completely isolated from the rest of the world.
And it is hidden, and shall not be found, and hid is one who finds it.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of several large pyramids built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Gaza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large catacomb.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and family members.
The "upper arch" symbol looks like a V and the "lower arch" looks like a paperclip or a square with no bottom.
and thou shalt put it into the rings by the sides thereof round about, and shalt put it upon the shoulder-pieces thereof.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and more determined.
You can easily mark your signs, but remember that printed signs exist because of the music, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were driven back to Paris by a mob from the women's market on 6 October 1789.
And the whole congregation of the people of the land returned, and cried out against the king and against the queen.
And the king rose up in haste, and the queen also, and all that were present with them; and they opened their treasures.
And a messenger shook the head of one of the king's chamberlains that was slain, who was slain in the fortress, as the queen looked on.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States in order to pay a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds that flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Undoubtedly, the enormous profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, traditionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or the strict sense that human destiny is determined by the logic embodied in scientific laws to their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism often reflect two general conceptions: that technological development in itself goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has more obvious "effects" on socially desirable societies than on natural societies.
For example, one might say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new methods of production have emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The proliferation of automobiles has led to road accidents, which have led to the development of new techniques in healthcare to treat people who are injured.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism coming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Chagall.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these were better aligned with social status than arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris was the fashion center of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
The situation deteriorated during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that warriors returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were considered more valuable than what the Byzantine market valued.
This was when the title of the center of fashion was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, working practices in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was as a result of the Crusades, when people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic system that uses stored seeds indigenous to the native area combined with economic rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Cross cultures brought together like-minded people who felt social norms were being ignored, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Microcultures can vary because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the use of several tragic cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during development.
Such children are called uncultured or "feral". Some uncultured children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, abandonment is due to the parents' ignorance of the child's mental or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced child abuse or severe beatings before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When feral children are raised entirely by non-human animals, they exhibit behaviors (within the physical range) almost entirely similar to those of the particular caretaker animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more fun, whiteboarding goes a step further.
Blackboarding is not a learning method, but an idea that supports people who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Whiteboards can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is an example of a whiteboard, but so is the little man with a paper clip at Microsoft.
Virtual whiteboards are embedded in the software to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to sexual abuse and even bullying.
No child should grow up in an environment that lacks nurturing, care and education, but it does.
We see the foster care system as a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to offer safe spaces, caring caregivers, sustainable education, and reliable health care.
The orphanage is supposed to provide all the necessities in the home that was previously taken from her.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and intrapersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet in terms of how it is used and appreciated have led to additional dimensions.
For example, education and social networking have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
"Personal behavior" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new dimensions of motivation by Igmi and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to Web pages.
The use of videography has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of small phrases, facial gestures lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting statements.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess intimacy.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic diversity: latent and manifest.
The mutation adds new genetic variation and selectively removes it from the set of mutations expressed.
Segmentation and recombination shift the changes back and forth between the two basins with each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for a mammal with digestive systems like humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: the development of malnutrition depression and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
REM sleep is the process of purposefully waking up during a normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find that you reset the clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other choices that require biorhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner calmness is related to the level of stress in a person's body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force. Each individual is able to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that prevents this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
At its core Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States of America (USA).
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to continue for the next 40 years and be fought virtually, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian Bridgehead.
However, these plans were scuppered almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Polish regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop the passage.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient peoples and cultures kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds located on hills and pastures, often by goatherds who were often children and teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherds of today. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were developed in England in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach greater speeds and to pull greater loads than the rough roads of the time.
Cross-braces were soon introduced to hold the wagon tracks steady. Gradually it was realized that they would be more efficient if the top of the wagon tracks were covered with iron tape.
This became common practice, but iron caused most wooden wagon wheels to wear out.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-steel railways were introduced.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk approximately two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (standing man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal features have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we need to find the root causes and eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly due to human scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by human population growth and consumerist lifestyles.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, the draft manuscript was signed by Speaker John Hancock and sent by Secretary Charles Thompson to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Brideside manuscripts extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today, most paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. We call them birds.
Most people would not think of them as dinosaurs because they had wings and could fly.
But there are many things about birds that so far resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T. rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are used as binary digits - or bits, to apply computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
Perhaps the best sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used informally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term has its roots in the older identification of bed bugs, which are parasitic insects that have adapted to being parasitic on the human body.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are brood parasites, and are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
The couple may plan to adopt a child.
In adoption, the child's biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually drives most scientific research.
Not only that, experimentation, which is testing done to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific subjects, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek learning, the West found itself detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of internal cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that continue a freewheeling cycle even in the absence of external cues.
One of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material was the Hershey and Chase experiment.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic fragment involved, or whether the affected cells are germ-line cells or not.
Mutations only in embryonic cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes such as flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the region's small towns by car to go to work and pass by people whose workplace is where they left off.
In this dynamic transportation attack, everyone is connected to and supports some kind of personal car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why are they inefficient on a daily basis? Are transport engineers incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of people and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, gateways tend to behave within a relatively fixed range; therefore, traffic flows usually tend to be reasonably stable and can be approximated mathematically.
To better visualize traffic flow, relationships between its three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helped them escape predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of having their wings folded back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of smaller places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system and the Sun (and even other stars) revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
Also, the Amazon is the widest river on Earth, at some points being six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long. The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
And the building of the pyramids of Cheon did not cease until the end of the old kingdom; and even then they did not attain to the [great] pyramids of Giza, in glory and in beauty.
The New Kingdom Egyptians admired their predecessors' buildings, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Also, Italian is the everyday language of most who work in government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have been aware of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was composed of a combination of one or four elements. The elements included earth, water, air, and fire.
This more closely resembles the four states of matter (identical in order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys with trace amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was first invented, it was a good companion for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer methods of writing, the pencil declined in status and use.
People now write messages on a computer screen, and no longer have to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pulling a heavy cart up a hill, and some of that energy is released as the nucleus fissions again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they would break apart with only a slight impact or even no impact at all.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer is called the crust.
And the thickness of it was fifty cubits on the one side, and a thousand cubits on the other side.
It shall be thinner under the crown, and wider under the crown.
There may be more maria nearby because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for volcanic debris to rise to the surface.
Content theories have focused on finding what makes people tick or attracts them.
These theories suggest that individuals have specific needs and/or desires that are internalized during development into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do certain things and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior emerge. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or ladies).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team is doing and make it their own.
However, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to a rift between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams have similar quality metrics to traditional teams, but there are subtle differences between them.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons to their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than their typical team members because their teams may meet due to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local managers.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFesto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
Creativity and initiative are achieved when all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization.
As a result, a collaborative process within the organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process for delivering service to the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, the leadership of the organization must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, thus narrowing the scope of the research and making it much more rigorous.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, strokes, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in machines.
Research in artificial general intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have evolved into separate scientific disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as built into several home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often a teacher wants to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers solutions for virtual tours.Students can view museum artworks, visit an aquarium or admire fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences in future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but older versions are kept online as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with incorrect grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes it.
Since students are often among the most critical audiences, the blogger tries to avoid criticism in order to improve his writing.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to satisfy an audience's interest inspires students to be smart and funny (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning beyond the normal school routine.
Appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by actively providing responses to Internet content, students can define their own position in the context of others' writings and express their own views on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's attractive, bilingual capital, is home to an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north, the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario stand out as something perceived by outsiders as essentially Canadian.
Large areas to the north are very sparsely populated and some areas are almost uninhabited.
Demographic comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is the largest independent landmass.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or dependencies of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bounded on the north by the Pacific Ocean and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers declare themselves married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences may lead to what they perceive as harassment and that being followed or grabbed by the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Be firm in keeping your distance from men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Baida and renamed it Casablanca after the Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as rugs, pottery, leather goods, shells and a range of seaweed, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the roads and especially the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano and one of the cheapest ways to access Mountain Gorilla on the African continent.
You can get around Goma by riding the motorized taxis called Boda Boda Boda. The typical fare is 500 Congolese pounds for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for remote and exotic lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, although its fame has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desertification.
One of the big stops during Lewis Gates' PBS series The Wonders of the World was Africa.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily guards and entrance fees to the park.
It may also be beneficial for a person to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to both sets of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is where many tourists find its main focus.
The fa√ßade of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glowing Charterhouse overlooking the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon Beach on the opposite side.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the English colonists made their home, so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the land's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 mi) into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not the only marshlands, however - they contain some of the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of about 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
National buses leave from the National Bus Station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bomtang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since national intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese national buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Pune (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oyapock in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers will have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 after the completion of Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also did agriculture for a living.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuri and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Indigenous Province", emerged as a result of the confrontation of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best football teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Chugan Fields in Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions at other times of the year can also be found here.
For more information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets, check the Argentine Pugilists Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be spent at the island's only bank located in Istanbul opposite FIC WEST stores.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to spend Falkland money outside the islands, so spend money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. The temperature is usually +30 ¬∞C in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the degrees displayed on the thermometer.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: precipitation is approximately uniform throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they seem, cows, deer, reindeer, bears and almost all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year due to poor distancing.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your tent clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave port.
All but one of the British battleships were sunk; nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of Topua's paramount chief Thabo Mbeki Lyautey III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location around two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
North Beach (in the North Harbour district) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost entirely sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, an affluent suburb of the Central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
It is sometimes a family-run beach with a good chain of shops lined up along the beach.
The main local brew is "Class One", not a blended brew, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local brew is called "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to eat, but New Zealand and Australian wines may make the trip better.
Drinking local tap water is perfectly safe, but bottled water is easy to find if you are careful.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is unfamiliar. "Espresso" is black, cappuccino is served with cream (not foam) and tea without milk.
The hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards.
Many trips to the rock are made all year round and injuries due to these reasons are rare on the rock.
However, seek advice from authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near coasts and near river mouths from October to April in the northern 1770s. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark species avoid humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often work with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other accommodations, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flights and hotel packages.
If they need time to think about the offer or prepare other documents for the destination (e.g. a visa), they can look up the reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agency and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the overwhelming majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it a vital part of their travel experience.
If you want to be close to the music, you should arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music has ended on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camps for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can be very noisy for those most affected.
Saint Petersburg sightseeing tours include sightseeing in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no clocks or watches, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them entertained.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness impairs judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone planning to ski at high altitudes or over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or glaciers.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't tread as bare as asphalt.
During a blizzard, there may be enough snow in a short period of time to trap you.
The field of vision may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on windshields.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Discovery tours are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a landmark for many visitors.
The term exploratory tourism in common usage refers to overland trips to observe Africa's stunning wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A recreational hiking tour (also called "bushwalking", "hiking safari" or "hiking") involves hiking for several hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face difficulties.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¬£2,500 and ¬£130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¬£7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have an ironing board and a rental iron, even if one is not available in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are a variety of water treatment methods, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes may be necessary.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have any concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar in their local areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, release toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can seriously injure or kill people are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging drift conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing an isolated patch of forest behind.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware that they are steep, narrow, and winding.
Installed speed limits are significantly lower than on the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important.
Surprisingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than elsewhere along the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and like the cuisine of their southern neighbor, Austria, in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied.
Fruit desserts are common, with apples baked inside desserts throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want small but rich desserts, try foods called Puffenkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region of Berlin.
Food preparation based on herbs and spices, with meat or salad.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the work can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of regional cuisines across the country.
However, even without the use of other terms, the term means the native food of the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, has a range of simple and spicy dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese include peanuts, red pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
And there were shoulder-pieces to the two ends of the breastplate; of the ephod the shoulder-pieces were fastened together.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of a person's foot getting caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his or her foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse can be dragged if the rider escapes. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, most equestrians wear riding helmets with flat, perfectly narrow heels.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider's leather to fall off the saddle if pulled back by the saddle.
Cocham√≥ Valley is Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
The peaks contain breathtaking views from the top of the mountains. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes through the endless potential of its walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with large numbers of enthusiasts, sometimes known as a "ski boom", planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The theory of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
This applies to ski touring or alpine style mountaineering but usually excludes the latter, which is done on steep terrain and requires much more difficult skiing and mountaineering.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you can cover more distance than on foot - but you can rarely reach the speed of skiing on the surface without a heavy backpack on the prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries means going through the visa application and passport control process several times.
However, the Schengen Area operates somewhat like a single country in this respect.
Generally, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again as long as you stay in the area.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax offices define items older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important to many other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami engaged in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived through fishing, hunting and the like, with reindeer mostly as animals of choice.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in S√°pmi, the Sami region.
The term "gypsy", although widely used, especially among non-Roma, is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
Recommendations are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often transient, general, and overly simplistic compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
