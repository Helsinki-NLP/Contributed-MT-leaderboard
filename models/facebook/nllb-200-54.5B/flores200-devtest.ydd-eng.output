USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and acknowledges the Olympic family's strong desire to foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by continuing to move forward with meaningful organizational change rather than certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already popular theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot usually, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say the creature's fur was chestnut above with a bright orange underside.
The encounter also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but did have other structures of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other structures.
The feathers' structure suggests that they were not used for flight but for regulating temperature or beauty. The researchers suggest that, although this is the mark of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult and not a bird.
The researchers suggested that even though this is the mane of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chick feathers.
A car bomb exploded outside police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to replicate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The result the team sought would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational force that causes large waves, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that light does.
The theory says that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of beauty, in is made of many small parts.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech affair: voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the candidate they want in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and writes under the ballot.
French electoral law strictly regulates the proceedings.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can agree that no envelopes are used at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

Adekoya was then in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any initial evidence may be obscured because her case has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law operates differently and courts have considered the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Fergussen of the University of Dundee observes that journalists appear to be treading a dangerous line if they publish images, for example, of the poor.
The Crown Office, which is now in charge of prosecutions, has advised journalists that further comments should not be made until further notice.
The document will reportedly discuss the nuclear deal, which Palestine wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East borders.
Other topics covered are reported to include the future city of Jerusalem which is holy to both peoples and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands continued military activity in the valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the PA only agrees to allow such activity for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary solid control test will have been closely monitored by rangers as the test was replicated and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received full safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It's Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The once-wild protests were driven by a failure to hold elections, some scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of non-working iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said there had been about 27 accidents related to the planes.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating events, which the company called "imminent".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's handling of the report "regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of injuries to the public.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six prisoners, including the children and the rape victims, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to use the restroom. Mendez was later shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his late teens.
His research indicates that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators detained two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Team wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tammy Dreamer said "Lana was the first queen of Extreme. My first supervisor. Lana died on the night of two white people.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as we were...maybe even crazier...love her and I will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 Census, support for Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard maintained throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the members in the poll are unanimous in wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his health became questionable due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the necessary drugs to overcome his pain because they were boycotting the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, announced the largest known prime number today, January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivered to Earth along with organic metals that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political trickery and foolishness".
He is considering running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to accurately locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being added and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
Fears of transportation shortages raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without any of Tim's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species was formed in just two generations, although it is assumed that the process took much longer, due to competition between an endemic Darwin's finch, Jasipiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Jasipiza canistris.
Gold can be arranged in all sorts of ways, it can be arranged in tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be bent and braided. It can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metals. It can be made so thin that it was once used to cover the hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make a mark using carrot juice.
The herbal juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH mass is indicated by the number of hydration (the H at pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been stripped (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry sticks together and then, with wet hands, knead them together in a bowl.
The oil on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will feel different and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Majapahit had a flush toilet in almost every dwelling, connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilizations, toilets were often part of an open bathroom where men and women mingled socially.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in the sphere receives the call and then reflects it back down almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into orbit by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in orbit because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our view and gravity.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in remarkable ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to deer and squirrels.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job each cat possesses that keeps it from sleeping with others.
Lions are highly social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Fridays are made up of one to three related adult memories, along with as many as thirty nieces and nephews.
The women are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides consist of groups of wolves or dogs, animals that are similar in appearance to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very fatalistic towards their victims.
A good all-round athlete, the tiger can crawl (though not well), swim, leap great distances and jump with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, lemurs, and jaguars. The four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a set of snarling, squealing words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch dolphins, snakes, rodents and frogs if they can. Almost all of the animals ocelots catch are much smaller than this.
Scientists think that octopuses follow and find animals to eat by scent, smelling for where they have been on Earth.
They can see very well at night with night vision, and are also very territorial. Ocelots catch their prey by looking around and around and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it came (such as if it moves across mountains or water, or if it migrates to a new island and cannot easily withdraw) it will sometimes find itself in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, and the new population will need different resources and different adaptations to be more competitive than they were previously.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adjust to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not exist.
The Musasaurus was the climax predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Musasaurs.
Its long mouth was equipped with more than 70 knife-edged teeth, along with an irregular set on the roof of the mouth, meaning that it was not possible for anything it moved its way to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included cockroaches, large fish, other carnivores, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans did have some unfamiliar foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of creature called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals while sitting on benches, the rich people liked to have banquets together where they could lounge on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient meals may not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient novel ever mentioned a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their descendants a main temple which was considered the abode of the god.
People made sacrifices to idols and the believers tried to serve the idols' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open courtyard and then an inner area where only the faithful can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was dedicated to the god.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent under the open sky.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops often had tables facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was settled secretly. In the Norse legends, they say that Erik the Red was driven from Iceland because of robberies, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Grønland.
But apart from his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, rulers, leaders and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever looked at the Maui National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written underneath the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written at the bottom of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the second page of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The words appear at the bottom of the document, reversed.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large format document (it measures 3⁄429 inches by 1⁄224 inches) was compiled for Sturges.
If so, it is likely that the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day invasion and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces they fought.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and then pushed into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture characterized by a relatively large group of people living and co-operating together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning human, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also denotes the greatness of the community.
City-states are the ancestors of peoples. A civilized culture involves transmission of knowledge through successive generations, cultural practices that are respected, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies initially formed a weak central government - with Congress being the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not possess the power to levy taxes, and in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also did not have the authority to impose tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be enforced, and the states relied so heavily on the central government that their contributions were often overlooked.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern region, with Italians competing internationally in Olympic events.
Japan has close to 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster of islands, Japan is sometimes referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European sailors first recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices, and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, relinquishing control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Jewels.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size until the advent of the analog film era.
It is still being reproduced today, but much more importantly, the site's content has been censored by digital camera image censorship formats.
The 35 mm layout is rough, slightly uneven, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of the expansion (divide by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) was therefore said to be 3:2.
Many well-known formats (APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much-overused and often-overlooked rule of thirds is a simple rule that makes vivid sense while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersections of lines that divide the image into thirds and the length and width (see example).
Throughout these periods in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under critical scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His pervasive power affected everyone from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and its concentration of financial power led to many questions about whether that belief had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain made a naval offer to Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, eliminating important military and civilian facilities, although the blockade was against accepted international law codified by several international treaties of the previous two centuries.
England mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of sea, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited reaction to the tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing mood of most citizens and peoples throughout the 1920s was of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, people wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a songbook, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a distinctive way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or dynasty in power was a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most notable of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period occurring for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout the ages, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods of early Chinese history, with thousands of people dying trying to occupy the highest seats in the opulent Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to humanity and not to a single leader.
Even after the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, leaving the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of Army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber/ability.
The French Revolution also influenced many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters of his everyday life. He often went to a cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) to meditate.
His self-immolation, which has survived the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's mental state.
Located above one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not even easy to find even though someone knows it exists. Once it's in the lake, it's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to house the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "stick up" sign looks like a V and the "stick down" sign looks like a staple or a box that folds its underside.
Up means you start at the tip and push the stick in, and down means you start at the toe (that's where your hand touches the stick) and pull the stick out.
An up-bend usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bend is stronger and more stable.
Feel free to insert your own notes, but remember the printed cue marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The exiled King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women.
Within a week they were on their way back to Paris surrounded by hooligans shouting and chanting slogans against the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to leave their carriage windows wide open.
At Versailles, a member of the mob cut off the head of a royal guard murdered in front of the assembled kings.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to absorb much of the costs and interest on bonds made in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great gains achieved from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would include the main merit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the development of the order.
The period during which these events occurred is officially referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages come after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, generally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or technological determinism to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by an intrinsic logical connection to scientific laws and their advancement in technology.
Most translations of technological terms share the same two general ideas: that development itself follows a course primarily within cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn "affects" societies that are inherently, rather than socially, conditioned.
For example, one can say that the motor car automatically leads to the development of diseases.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars, due to new methods of production being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high number of car owners also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the creation of new techniques in the medical field for healing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, exemplified by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography brought individuals together, and over time customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and these customs, being at peace with the place of the society, were preferable to arbitrary fixed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter for luxury starting from about 400 A.D. and continuing until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, possibly attributed to the fact that crusaders returned bearing gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fez's capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the fixed communication channels, silences in the West can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the period as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using scattered grains native to the ecosystem along with crop rotation or other very simple methods to obtain the maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel abandoned by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by the generation, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make up a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, regional, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a profound and emblematic use of clothing, which includes fashions, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of social interaction is to highlight the several unfortunate failures of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse, are deprived of adult social interaction while growing up.
Such children are referred to as feral or feral. Some feral children have been abandoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment is the result of a parent's rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Some children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma prior to being abandoned or running away.
Others are suggested to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When confronted by non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (with physical limitations) almost identical to those shown towards animals, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step too far.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the little paper-clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are designed to ask, help with, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to complete on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons that include abuse, neglect, and even persecution.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they aren't respected, shown affection, and educated, but they do.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and affordable hero care.
Foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs of those who are missing in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines parts of both dimensions in interpersonal communication.
The visible character of the Internet leads to other aspects of usage and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal confusion" and "intimate connection" were also identified as new motives by Aimee and McCord (1998), when evaluating audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the generation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few seconds.
In particular, it has been reported that someone can detect if a person is lying by correctly evaluating microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of a hearing impairment can nevertheless assess truthfulness correctly.
He even suggested that such abilities in particular human behaviors could be contributed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research showed that there are two types of genetic change: conserved and released.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of demonstrated variation.
Segregation and recombination switch back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid requirements from the increased resources available there.
Again, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, undernutrition, and premature death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and vegetables, but these are harder for us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (shrimp, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but high in protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their fertility problems in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep arousal is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a quieter alarm clock to bring yourself to consciousness before you ever wake up.
If you find yourself permanently setting the clock near your bed, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based practices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a common diuretic) before bed, forcing one to get up to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of attachment in one's body and mind.
The lower the attachment, the more positive life force there is. Every person has the potential to find inner peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own attachment and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the Mahayana path of devotion and by many methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite similar. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of only-love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and images.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Vaha. Through the depiction of certain deities, the energy flow is unified, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is cultivated.
Germany was a formidable enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, the contradictions of system, process and culture led to the countries' collapse.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be vigorously opposed, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete literally overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the northern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to move goods is certainly the fastest way to transport large numbers of people and goods across water.
The job of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans attempted to help move men and materiel across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to intercept the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have surpassed England as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began using them for easy access to milk, honey, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed over mountains and other vegetated areas, sometimes with goatherds assigned to them. The goatherds were often children or young males, very similar to the more widely known pastoralists.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon roads consisted only of parallel-width tracks, they allowed horses pulling them to attain greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads.
Crustaceans were known early on to hold the spines in place. Eventually, however, it was realized that it would be more effective to have a rod of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron more than eroded the steel wheels on the wagons.
Over time, iron wheels were replaced by cast iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails appeared.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, and humans began walking approximately two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, obviously didn't go very high.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Saelanthropus may have walked on two feet as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases, so if we want something that is not just a temporary solution, we can find the underlying problems and we can deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological progress, and problems have become worse due to overpopulation and man's increasing standard of living.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent across the street to the printing office of John Dunlap.
Over the course of the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the gardens of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document known to exist. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about primates that still look like a dinosaur.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal fixation may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as fractures are very general and an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal pollution may be the ingestion of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the shield for specific first aid instructions for that particular item.
The title insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The word comes from early familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects easily adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nocturnal, becoming accustomed to living in the nest or habitat of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A parent may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to have a baby.
Parents can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that the other parent can parent the child.
Science's main goal is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. The method actually conducts mostly scientific research.
However, experimentation alone is not sufficient, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible outcomes. Asking questions and making observations also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers looked to classical texts and, specifically, to the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek philosophers and scientific heritage.
Many accepted rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their reproduction by biological clocks.
Temporal rhythms, which are not simple responses to external temporal cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue several uncertain cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase test was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by staining either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the proteins of the phage with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can also have several other effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism targets people who are interested in visiting natural places for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activity include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about arranged marriages in Borneo.
Every spring, people leave small country towns by car to go to their workplace and pass by others whose workplace is where they just left it.
In the dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supportive of, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that the massive carbon economy knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that had supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
And you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges in developed countries.
Given that transportation systems contain so much waste, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the relationships they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic law is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers operate in a logically consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be more or less mathematically determined.
To better represent traffic flow, associations were made between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of rail facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily invade enemies and find food and travel more easily.
Most insects have the ability to retract their wings back to the length of their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from passersby.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems understandable, because the world doesn't feel the way it moves, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
New Kingdom Ancient Egypt stood on its earlier monuments, which were already well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can be found in nature in native form and are quite easy to excavate with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have solutions that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny pieces called atoms.
Atoms are so amazingly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of the sentence.
So the Blythe became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil declined in status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having come close to a blue pencil.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something more modern comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy car pushing up a mountain, the nucleus collapses again releasing some of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no interference.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer part of the Moon is called the crust.
The layer is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people tick and what they like.
These theories suggest that humans had certain needs and/or desires that were forgotten as they progressed to adulthood.
These theories look at what is certain about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when managers begin to manage their former employees. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or member).
This type of supervisor has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making estimates, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything that the group has already done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in divisions between the leaders and the members of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same standards as conventional groups, but there are slight differences.
Virtual group members often function as the point of contact for their actual physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members as their group may meet in different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The need for a true "virtual team" (Larsen and Lefesta, 1989, p109) is also an inherent part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the active departments of an organization, intelligence can result.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a constraint can lead to a new custom process to serve the needs of the buyer.
Before an organization can be transformed, leadership must manufacture a culture of transformation as well as communicate science and organizational learning.
Engel (2006), explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, so it narrows the research field to make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for some time that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect cognition and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our brain.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Patterns include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as being built into some home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Quite often a teacher will like to take her students to places where you can't go by bus.
Technology facilitates reading through virtual excursions. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip experience is also a great way to look back on a trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from Bennett School in North Carolina paint a website throughout their trip to the state capitol. Each year the website is modeled after Fondness, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often start their blog with a blend of grammar and writing, the audience's involvement usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers should strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to cater to the interest of the audience drives undergraduates to be smart and interesting/engaged (Tauto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Passive use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can clarify their position in relation to others' descriptions as well as express their own views on certain issues" (Awake, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums depicting Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka River and its interior.
All of these things and more appear on anything that is considered officially Canadian by foreigners.
Large areas higher up in the north are sparsely inhabited and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that involves many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are in Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the greatest by any measure, and is a world leader when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it was greatly influenced in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women report that they are married, regardless of marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women may notice that cultural differences can result in what they would consider cheating and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firmly attracted to men, and don't be afraid to be strong (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used throughout the Phoenician, Roman, and Marinid periods as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was later abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Badia and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, glued-on articles, leather goods, hakhas, and a wide variety of gifts, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Far East near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gamma was devastated by lava from the Nireganga volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is perfectly safe, any visit to the interior of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of warfare going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for trekking the Nyiragongo Volcano, one of the most expensive mountain guerrilla treks in Africa.
You can use bada-bada (motorcycle taxi) to get back to Goma. The normal (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is often used as a metaphor for beautiful, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a ghost town, although its good name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the huge celebrations throughout Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities because it has a stronger Arab than African look.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions, and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANparks).
Like all South African national parks, there is daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It is also possible for visitors to purchase a wild card, which allows entry to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists claim as their main focus.
The outline of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a beautiful stick chart that becomes more prominent with the sight of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
Emergencies from Hong Kong Island's urban development are heavily concentrated on reclaimed land near the north coast.
This is the site that the British colonists took for themselves and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian country is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining parts of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sunderbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 painted hyenas in the region.
Buses depart from the sub-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bomtang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and strong.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Faro (No. 150) and Funchal (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lines of 3.50 meters wide.
The maximum height under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction work was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also subsisted on agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of primitive tribes such as the Guayuru and Payagua, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indians", was born as a result of a clash between Spanish forces and the local native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization era which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has sought to preserve much of its ancient character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the Polo Fields in Los Cañitas.
Small competitions and struggles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, search Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is estimated to be the same as one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are commonly accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also widely accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the property in advance to determine an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange foreign currency outside the islands, so exchange it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30o Celsius are normal.
The winter can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and rain together make it feel colder than the master says.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how noble they look, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. The animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, they warn that plants attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the site of the infamous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
Throughout the war for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the town ended with the assassination of the paramount chief Thapae Thomasis Lilufi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's straddling of two harbours. The most popular are in these three areas.
North Beaches (in the North Harbor area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and mostly have shade provided by pahutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitematā Harbour, in the upper reaches of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are often crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops lining the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One", it is not a complicated beer, but a tasty and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Mante".
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may fare better.
The local tap water is generally safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short shot is "espresso", cappuccino is topped with cream (and sugar), and tea is served with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very good.
Many trips to the summit are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these factors are rare.
You should still follow instructions from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near coasts and near river waterways from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found out of season.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Mostly sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively inhabit the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to prepare other documents for your purpose (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to sleep on the floor, and most attendees consider it an important part of survival.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early enough to book a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though music on the main stages has ended, there may be parts of the performance that will still play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with children.
If you are sailing across the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as falling ice creates a dangerous situation for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises take time to enter the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually turned off, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment provided to keep guests in a good mood, and they keep it local.
Some people gamble for drinks at their own expense. But being drunk damages your health, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
A person traveling to high latitudes or over mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as well as you would on flat roads.
During snow storms, enough snow to make you stick can fall in a very short time.
Vision may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by rain or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The title safari, in popular usage, refers to overland journeys to view the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
The lions, cheetahs, and leopards are occasionally shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or walking "walking") involves walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Several events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the suspension was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March, mostly coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended to July, 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Beagle-proof clothing helps to disguise it. Many hotels have a dog crate and a dog bed ready for use on the mountain, even if someone is not invited into the room.
If you don't have a Beagle iron, or you don't like carrying bags of gum, you can try using a hand dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow stuff to get too hot (which can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are other ways of purifying water, some more effective against certain pressures.
In some places, boiling water is enough for one minute; in others, you need it in a few minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have a concern, you may want to consider buying your bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals that are unfamiliar from their home regions.
Fats can damage food, cause diarrhea, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing humans through force, do not qualify as fats.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from tax at specific locations.
Travelers who go to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmount presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing the isolated underworld terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: smooth gradients, narrow lines, sharp turns dominate there.
Posted maximum speeds are considerably less than in the previous and following sections - averaging 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than not.
Interestingly though, cell phone service is much stronger here than in any other region, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit snacks are common, with boiled apples available year-round, and cherries and plums available throughout the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Famous pastries often go very well with a glass of strong coffee.
If you want to try small but rich pastries, try what are locally called Berliner, Funky, Krappen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either thin or thick applied to the surface of the liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indian food is a generic term covering a huge variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the title usually means the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese food has a variety of unique spices, the strongest being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
stirrups are provided for the rider's feet which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but remains with a leg caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most hikers wear hiking boots with a heel and a very narrow, smooth sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety routes that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is dragged backwards by a following rider.
Cochabamba Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a selection of granite walls and cliffs.
Peaks include breathtaking views from mountain peaks. Climbers from all parts of the world continue to make new paths through the endless possibility of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include ice skating and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski bums, planning entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill ice skating is a sport that dates back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Austria.
Backpacking while skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It includes but does not usually include alpine style ski touring or mountain climbing, the latter conducted in extreme terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a walking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat larger and longer distances than by walking - but only in rare cases will you achieve the speed rate of cross-country skiing on a heavy backpack on wet tyres.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Going through many countries under normal circumstances, one would expect to have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen Area, however, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in the zone, you can usually cross the border and go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member states separately, which requires time, money and paperwork.
There is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies classify items more than a hundred years old as antiques.
This view varies geographically, with age limits being shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted goods may be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar machine-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important occupation for the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also significant for many other subjects.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived by catching fish, seals, and eels, having reindeer merchantmen ever hunt animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is sometimes considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayals of Romani people.
If the country you want to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to check the proposals of governments other than your own, but their proposals are designed for their citizens.
As one example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may have to contend with different circumstances than European or Arab citizens.
Advisories are simply a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often brief, superficial, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive snow, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "environmentally friendly courses" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all of the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will normally last 2-5 days and will include rifle practice, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with existence in the wild are well known, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid travel documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without writing the gender (X) or documents altered to accommodate desired name and gender changes.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize the documents is equally significant.
Signs at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Reef currents are the return flows of whales that anchor themselves to beaches, often near harbors or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated at somewhat deeper parts, and a rapid wave to deep water may occur there.
Most deaths occur as a result of drowning trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the water, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your destination and if you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes faster than culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
As soon as they become accustomed to a new culture, it is sometimes difficult for them to return to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already used to the new culture and you have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrive abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that traveling in a new country takes getting used to.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound pyramid and teacher performance is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see it in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the gossip of tourists and vendors. The story of gossip and lecturers is just like in a history book.
The Sphinx is forever the underworld and the harbinger of a long story.
The scenes are exhibited on the pyramids and the other pyramids are visited.
South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the extinct caldera of a still-active volcano provides a wonderful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Water.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge on the plateau, then emerge again to form the 360 km range of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (15,710 ft) with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone doesn't usually take the place of a cell phone, as you need to be indoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is widely used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require long-distance data and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you additional information about connecting to this service.
A very popular option for those planning a surprise year is to relax and study.
This is especially common with high school dropouts, allowing them to take one year off before college, taking away from their education.
In many cases, completing a mid-year course abroad can improve your chances of getting into higher education back in your home country.
There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in the study programs.
Finland is a strong sailing destination. The "land of a thousand rivers" also has thousands of islands, in the rivers and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily have to have a yacht in the archipelagos and rivers.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, smaller ships or even a kayak provide another option.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but outside of the absolute singularity (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most of the remarkable Baltic ships put in for an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days and return and sleep on a boat at night.
If you enter the country only by boat, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some circles show Berlin, Germany in the foreground. As you can see from the map, Upper Berlin is not near the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the circle.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced some other trauma.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that a lot of people have.
In part, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or not being in control.
Companies that specialize in shipping packages are well paid for shipping items quickly. Often, time is of the essence with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an important transaction.
On some routes, the larger companies had their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If they were shipping things by air freight, some routes would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to make it go faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to ever send baggage to a passenger, and here's how you get in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this doesn't come cheap; as a rule, you can expect to pay more than four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for business class discounts or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic wars.
In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of a self-declared Transitional Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations have resumed between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, advanced, and busy commercial center, built around a huge lake and surrounded by mountains.
Its wide avenues, glass buildings and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and ancient mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik overlooks the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an interesting octagonal church.
In the church yard there are interesting marble sculptures of doves of different sizes.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around the patient's room.
To the north within easy reach is the romantic and interesting town of Sintra which became known to foreigners after a glowing account of its beauty recorded by Lord Byron.
Scuturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabeça da Raca.
Also to the north is the Great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site of almost incalculable importance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are many men and women who still live and have spent time here, and many others who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the utmost dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Don't say anything about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't pollute the space by writing or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan as it is established by law to be the first and official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disturbances are reported by an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being eccentric, vain, and pretentious.
Although this is often an accurate stereotype, the best way to arrive in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien éduqué". It will greatly simplify the journey.
Paris's crisp exterior will improve quickly if you pay attention to a few key details.
Plitvice National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean plantations.
It has a particularly wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different types of soils and many types of altitudes.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, sable, lynx, wildcat, and cocker spaniel can be found there, along with many more familiar species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear veils that cover the knees and also have the shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries offer protection to women who come to visit, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun upon entering.
In addition, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
This can also be guaranteed from the many items at the entrance but these clothes are not washed after each use and you may not feel comfortable wearing these shoes. One size fits all for the men!
Majorcan cuisine, like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in the summer, is the pa amb ali: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All sentences, including the C word in front of you, always begin with a capital letter, even at the end of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between relative verbs and objects.
It also apparently makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat more complicated by having the user figure out when and whether a verb or adjective is being used in a particular way.
Hebrew is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look for are C and G, because their sound depends on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce R and RR differently: cara means expensive, indica means expensive.
Persian has a moderate grammar and an extremely smooth one.
Therefore, reading this pronunciation booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian pronunciation and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish may be too quick to conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually not entirely modern, and remain as museums or places of education.
While light pollution was not as much of a problem in their day as it is today, they were usually found in cities or near campuses, more easily accessible than buildings in modern times.
Most modern exploratory telescopes are huge dwellings in remote regions with variable atmospheric conditions.
Consider where cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the royal court.
Plants look their best in a natural setting, so resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting "specimens" will also expose you to being thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a highly secure place to be and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator will require you to cope with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the next Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.
Inland waterways can be a good area around which to base a halide.
For example, visitors can visit the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or sail along the Erie Canal.
They also take note of paths to familiar places and hiking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night watching the sunrise from a single vantage point.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for the tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday morning throughout the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the celebration shortly after midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the continent's long expanse, mammals cannot make the journey, making giant tortoises the main grazing animals in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the phenomenon of the polar night, which means that the sun will not shine above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas have a small population, and lamb farming is therefore not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Skirts are common business attire, and coworkers call each other by last names or job titles.
Workplace collaboration is critical, placing an emphasis on group work rather than individual effort.
Employees must often obtain their superiors' approval for every decision they make, and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
