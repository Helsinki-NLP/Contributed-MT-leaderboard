Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski served as an advisor to the John F. Kennedy and then the Lyndon B. Johnson administrations.
During the 1976 election, he was a foreign policy advisor to Carter, and later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it also provides details that fossils often cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a coil, but have other features of feathers - rays and double-rays - the researchers concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but instead for temperature regulation or display.
The researchers reasoned that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not juvenile down.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the research team was looking for would be caused by forces similar to the tides of the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was ""very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".""
Some patients may have contracted the bacteria at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, at least two of whom were hospital staff.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it appears that the proportion of XDR-TB in the overall population of people with TB is still low; 6 000 out of a total of 330 000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground", says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral law codifies the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision, and who follow specific procedures.

She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be rendered useless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee states that ""journalists take a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects".""
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made before charges are laid.
According to the leak, the leaked document deals with the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the 1967 Six Day War.
Other subjects reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of continuous military presence in the valley after an agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the additional pest control experiment would be closely monitored by the rangers as the experiment was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and culture for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional council seat in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The semi-violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
There have been reports of some 60 cases in which faulty iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called ""minor".""
"The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report ""very regrettable".""
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Services reported no injuries in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed fetal lung maturation.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two ""black boxes"" on Wednesday".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman".""
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I am ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's better off where she is now".""
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his condition there have been doubts about his fitness.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to overcome his pain because it's banned in competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water resources, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Because comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as ""political chatter and nonsense""".
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be deployed, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of lack of transportation opened up the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have taken much longer because of breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Españoladarwin finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes.
It can be drawn into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, and it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It could be made very thin and attached to other metals; it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called ""illuminated manuscripts""".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together, then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman society they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the biggest thing the wheel has done is give us much simpler and faster modes of transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat a much larger variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leos act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but more like a series of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans give off (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, a lot of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals can't survive.
Mosasaurs were at the top of the food chain in their day, so they had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, which meant that there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could recline while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was viewed as the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to appease them with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 30 inches by 24 inches [75 cm by 62 cm]) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were French people who made a deal with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines in some way the size of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations, and a civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and an equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it fell to the often uncooperative state governments to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to abolish tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be added, and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a transformation of native grain production, hiring Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still manufactured today, but more important is its aspect ratio inherited from the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS) match this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main teachings of Christendom is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it dangerous even for neutral ships.
Having received a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most people and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stage of Chinese history, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability in which the provinces were divided, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was often violent warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history when thousands died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to flourish.
The same was true in the military, where rank in the army was now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to revolutionize.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his daily life. He would often visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" (light) mountain to meditate".
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it's there.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., Cheops Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller funerary monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'upstroke' marking looks like a V and the 'downstroke' marking looks like a staple or a square with no bottom".
Up means that you should start at the tip and push the string up, and down means that you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the string) and pull the string down.
An upstroke usually generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own lines, but remember that the printed lines are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, a member of the mob waved the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 14th century.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from that of technology driving development or the technological imperative to the strict view that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself follows a trajectory largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are primordial, rather than socially determined".
For example, it could be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the building of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating with writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its influence declined in the 14th century mainly because of the fact that Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its zenith between the 11th and 13th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication routes, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
"Such children are called ""wild"". Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all by themselves.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviours (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the specific foster animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, reinforcement learning goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support to individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the little computer guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalised into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the learner to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster homes are designed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions of user theory.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"Also, ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man's to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plants.
Furthermore, the absence of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
By comparison, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also offer high-quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in much the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah do today".
Sleep napping is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you usually turn your alarm off during sleep, set it at the other end of the room so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, causing the need to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force present, each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
God yoga is central to Tibetan meditation, and through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800 000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, largely by means of U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them for milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic cats were usually kept in packs that roamed on hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar sheep herder.
Wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses pulling them allowed for higher speeds and heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
Grinders were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became the practice, but the iron wore more on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, were not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases symptomatic treatment, but if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been aggravated by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the president of the convention, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printery of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
"Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap folios known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the handwritten original has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these digits are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning may be an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term rams is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient relatives of bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predatory beetles and bedbugs are residents, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides almost all research.
Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not simply responses to external periodic signals have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the subject with a radioactive phosphor or the protein of the subject with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to experience the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small country towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in some way connected to, and supportive of, a transport system based on private car use.
Science now shows that this massive collective economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Well-behaved drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in planning, designing and operating roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot retract their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most abundant and second-longest river, its flow being more than eight times that of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, six miles [9 km] wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon is 4,000 miles long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated country.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemicals such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, when they could be found in nature in their original form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter was composed of one or more of four basic elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he theorized that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Calcium and potassium are metals, and then, of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was a faithful companion to many people when it first appeared.
Sadly, as newer writing methods have developed, the pencil has lost its status and uses.
Today, people type messages on computer screens, never needing to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 45 miles thick on this side and 60 miles thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar ocean and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what turns people on or what appeals to them.
The theories argue that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain ""one of the gang""".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're transformed into an unrecognizable person who feels he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold themselves to the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones may affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of an actual ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The ""invisible team"" is the management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member".
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technology allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and even handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been built into several home computer and video game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of teaching in every classroom, and often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips: students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful scenery with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are allowed to remain online as a scrapbook.
Students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more aware of the world around them", and the need to satisfy readers' interests encourages students to be witty and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""can allow students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)".
Ottawa, Canada's charming bilingual capital, offers a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the beautiful, unspoiled landscape of Muskoka.
All of this and more makes Ontario what outsiders consider to be the very essence of Canada.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are part of France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to wear a ring too (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru-l-Badya, which was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you are visiting outside Goma, you should investigate the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places".
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile river.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each housing different wildlife.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and it is considered the flagship among South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been likened to a glittering bar graph enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of the built-up area of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonialists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that lies in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is wetland.
Designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 white-tailed deer.
Buses depart from the district common bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two aisles that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "giant province of India", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the native indigenous population".
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, contact the Asociación Argentina de polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and USD are often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outlying islands, but British and American currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C]
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: rainfall remains about the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say you should stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost any large animal are capable of attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of Auckland's location between two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being divided into three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most the Maori myrtles provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes popular family beaches with a good selection of beachside shops.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but perhaps New Zealand and Australian wines will fare better.
The local drinking water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
"Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of flat white coffee. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino has a layer of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef year-round, and damage to the reef from any of these causes is rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubmanets occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770 and can sometimes be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even combined flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where the action is, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because walking through ice causes really terrible sounds for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos often make every effort to keep patrons spending as much time and money as possible, often with no windows or clocks and with exits hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to make them stay.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as you can on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or ice, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues virtually uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to cross-country trips to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""bush walk"" and a ""hiking safari") consists of walking either for a few hours or for several days".
The Paralympics will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympics would have started.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without tax or other surcharges at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing isolated virgin forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, use common sense: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
Speed limits are markedly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and enforcement is even more important.
Surprisingly, cell coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from the neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want small but mighty pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional dishes spread throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term tends to mean the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a variety of simple seasonings, the most common of which are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Footrests are supports for the rider's feet that hang down either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can be a safety hazard as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away.
For one thing, most riders wear boots with heels and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that ensure that a stirrup will release from the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
Known as the Yosemite of South America, the Cochamó Valley, Chile's premier rock-climbing destination, has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly carving new routes through the countless walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 B.C.!
Boating as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking - but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen area operates more or less like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing multiple passport checks.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques; some tax offices define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
"Although commonly used, especially among non-Roma, the word ""gypsy"" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people".
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel medical insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, the circumstances of U.S. citizens in the Middle East may be different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The picture presented is often hasty, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all hazardous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of it, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include heavy snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"An Internet search for ""hostile environmental education"" will likely yield the address of a local business".
A course usually covers all the issues mentioned here but in much more detail, often with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role play, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books on wilderness survival are plentiful, while those on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid travel documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an indicated gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender persons who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass the X-ray check with integrity and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking on the shore, often at a reef or similar location.
The underwater topology concentrates the reverse flow into a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait to be rescued.
Return shock comes earlier than culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their culture of origin.
When you return from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new land must adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors, and the sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The backdrop is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains merge with the plateau and then return to form the 225-mile-long [360 km] Ellsworth Range, which is split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, since one must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is frequently used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular with recent graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without jeopardising their education.

Usually, a fee is charged to enroll in these programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly.The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands in its lakes and archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any pleasure craft, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specific Baltic cruises include a longer stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people to overcome fears associated with discomfort in the unknown or loss of control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering items quickly, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they shipped items by air freight, some routes may have taken several days to clear customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Known historically as Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed city and a bustling commercial center located on a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

The Parisians' British exterior will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is thickly forested, mainly with beech, fir and spruce, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly high species richness, due to the extent of microclimate, different soils and varying elevations.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and chamois are found there, along with many common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give scarves to unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
By the same logic, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock in the entrance hall but those garments are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun you, are capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to figure out whether a verb or an adjective is in the noun form makes the writing somewhat more complicated.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.

But people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the kind of problem they are today, they are usually found in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or cherry blossom viewing, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where they used plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian springtime fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter holiday, and at midnight the congregation breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, and so the giant tortoise became the primary grazer on the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience polar nights, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
