In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, meaning that the scientists used ZMapp as a baseline and compared it to three other treatments.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that are usually missing from fossils alone.
Scientists have determined that the upper part of this dinosaur's plumage was light brown and the lower part was white or yellowish.
Such discoveries also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed plumage called an umbilicus, but they do have other characteristic feathers, such as fins and small fins, and the researchers hypothesized that these other characteristics evolved later to become the umbilicus.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used for temperature control and display, rather than for flight.
This is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but if you look at the samples, the researchers say, you can see that it's not juvenile feathers, it's adult feathers.

Although it relies heavily on theory, the program is designed to simulate observations of Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by a tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter in the galaxy's water.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB in a region of South Africa called KwaZulu-Natal.
He mentioned in an interview that the new variant is "very deadly, very difficult to deal with and scary".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the disease at the hospital, and that at least two of them may have been healthy hospital workers.

Voting in France is traditionally a low-key experience. Voters are isolated in booths and place pre-printed sheets of paper representing their candidates into envelopes.
After the staff verifies the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
Rather, the French electoral law strictly sexualizes the process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, allowing voters and supervisors to see that no other envelopes are present at the beginning of voting, and that nothing is entering except the envelope of an accredited voter that has been duly counted.
Candidates can send a representative to observe the entire election process, and in the evening, a volunteer conducts the voting under strict supervision according to a specific procedure.

She is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but her reputation is widely known and witness testimony may be biased.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law applies differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, says that when journalists publish photos of suspects and so on, it's like they're running a con.
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the overall prosecution, indicated to reporters that there would be no further comment, at least until the indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document is related to a border dispute that the Palestinians want based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly included the future of Jerusalem, holy to both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
When the agreement was reached, Israel demanded that the current garrison in the area remain for 10 years, and the PA agreed that the garrison would leave after five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional pest control trials had to be closely supervised by forestry officials, who monitored the trials and evaluated their effectiveness.
A partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooter Association of Australia recruited qualified volunteers under the Sport Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, all four lions selected for the first shooting campaign received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
This is Mattelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to prepare for new elections.
The committee was formed as part of Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Some violent protests have been sparked by the fact that some elections have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
"Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating that were ""not serious""".
"The financial industry responded by saying it was ""really sorry"" about Apple's delay in releasing its report".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Disaster Management Agency said no damage was reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken a bus full of Hong Kong tourists hostage in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M-16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, when an elderly woman needed to go to the bathroom, the photographers took her place.
Riggins followed in his father's footsteps into medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and gynaecologist and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Riggins, who works at the hospital, began investigating early onset pain in his spare time.
His research showed that when hormones were administered, fetal lung maturation was accelerated.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tammy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. She passed away on a night with two moons.
"Dustin ""Goldhurst"" Runnels said, ""Luna is as weird as I am...maybe weirder...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place""".
In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, a survey of 1,400 people found that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll, 34 percent said they wanted Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In a poll, 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic soon, while 31 percent said it should not.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the relay at the Commonwealth Games, but it was suspected that illness had taken its toll.
The drugs needed to overcome the pain were prohibited in the games, so I couldn't take them.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at Central Missouri State University, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
Several people demonstrated the discovery using a variety of hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water to Earth, along with organic material to build proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as ""political gibberish and nonsense"."
He's projected to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This allows air traffic controllers to use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with very high accuracy, unlike ground-based radar-based technology used in the past, which provides more accurate information to pilots.
In Wembley, there will be no additional transport or overground train stops, no overground car parks and no public transport car parks.
Concerns about the lack of public transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors without fans.
Last Thursday, a study published in the journal Science announced the formation of a new species of algae in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Although researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, the process is thought to have taken much longer because of interbreeding between native birds, the Darwin's finch, the middle ground finch, and migrating finches, the great squid.
Gold can be machined into all kinds of shapes. Even very small shapes can be extruded.
It can be cut with a fine line, it can be bent or twisted, it can be hammered or rolled.
"Gold can be made very thin and can be attached to other metals, so thin that it was used to decorate the hand-paintings of books called ""colored manuscripts""".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemicals are.
The pH level is expressed as the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had its electrons stripped off.
The two dry powders are whisked together and then kneaded into a ball with a clean hand moistened with water.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers to give you an interesting texture, forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had water-filled toilets connected to sophisticated sewage systems in almost every home.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Santorini and Crete.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians and Chinese also had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths shared by both men and women.
If you're talking to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space bounce signals back almost immediately after they receive them.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a super rocket that's over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, but the biggest change is that it has given us a more convenient and faster means of transportation.
It brought us trains and cars and all kinds of transportation.
Below are medium-sized animals such as rabbits and nutria, and medium-sized cats and animals that hunt deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stuffed pet cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the idea that each cat has a unique job, which prevents them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats and animals that live in groups.
A pride consists of one to three identical adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are closely related to each other because sisters and daughters come mostly from large extended families.
A pride of lions behaves remarkably like a pack of wolves or dogs, similar to lions (but unlike other big cats and animals), which can be very deadly to prey.
Tigers are like multi-talented athletes: they can climb high, swim, leap long distances, and can pull five times as hard as humans.
Tigers are herd animals like lions, leopards and jaguars, and only these four cats and animals can pollinate.
The roar of a tiger is different from the roar of a lion, but it is similar to the roar of a sentence of words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, preying mostly on smaller monkeys, snakes, rodents, and algae, which are much larger than itself, when possible.
Scientists think the ocelot uses its sense of smell to track and find prey by sniffing out where it's been.
The ocelot has very good night vision, so it can see in the dark, and it can move very carefully, and it hunts by covering its prey as it blends into its surroundings.
When small populations of organisms become separated from the main populations from which they were dispersed (either by moving to mountains or rivers, or by moving to new islands where they cannot easily move), they often find that they are in a different environment from where they were before.
Because these new environments have different resources and competitors, new populations require different characteristics or adaptations to be competitive.
The original population hasn't changed at all, but it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new people began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look more and more different from everyone else.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the two groups will look too different to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of a new species, and it's an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution every week.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and consume the carbon-dioxide we exhale.
Plants use photosynthesis from the sun to make their own food, and they also provide shade.
We build houses out of trees, we make clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat is vegetables, and without plants, animals can't survive.
Mosasaurs were the top predators of their time, so they had nothing to fear but other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were filled with over 70 very sharp teeth and these teeth were in addition to the roof of the mouth, which meant that no one could escape if they passed in front of it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and it may have fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, or even human flesh.
This animal also attacked everything that came into the water, even the giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus.
Their food is largely familiar to us, but some of the ingredients of Roman feasts were strange and exotic: wild boar, ducks, snails, and rodents such as the winter dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to sit together and share their meals, lying side by side and relaxing.
The ancient Roman diet could not have contained the food that would come centuries later to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they didn't eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples to all the gods they worshipped.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to fulfill the gods' demands through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctum that only priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called Gujrat, were built as part of the temple.
At the very top of the tower is a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
The life of the Hebrew family took place almost entirely outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were just stalls on the street, and the stones were used to build houses.
Because there were no large forests in Canaan, wood was very expensive.
Greenland was settled sporadically. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. And as he sailed further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Each country was part of Scandinavia, but Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different people, kings, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. It's not a treasure map, even though there's something written on the back of it.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words ""Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776"" written upside down at the bottom of the document".
No one knows who wrote it, but this large vellum document was originally dried and stored.
So it's very likely that they simply labeled it.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the ""Vichy"" French, the French who chose to side with Germany in 1940 rather than fight against the invaders".
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a single shared culture, a society, a very large group of people who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen, and the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and the Latin word citavas, meaning city or city-state, which defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of states. Civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the survival of cultural footprints and their equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving meaningful historical evidence and are not properly treated as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central government with Congress as the sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Because Congress had no power to tax, and no national executive or judicial branch, it often had to rely on uncooperative state authorities to enforce its laws.
Nor did Congress have the power to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
These clauses could only be amended with the unanimous consent of all the states, and the state representatives who ignored the federal government were mostly absent from the meetings.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, baseball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and occasionally Italian athletes participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"From a geographical standpoint, Japan is often called ""the archipelago"" because of the group of islands it possesses".
Taiwan began with what passing European sailors in the 15th century called Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began to produce rice and sugar through shifting cultivation.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 proclaimed Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan and ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings that are just on the edge have been reconstructed to give tourists a better sense of what it looked like.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still-image format in the world is 35 millimeters, which was the main film size used towards the end of the analog film era.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited into the image sensor format of digital cameras.
It's a bit confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So the cross-ratio of this form is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS format) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining the order of an image.
This law states that the most effective location for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of lines that triangulate the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity bound the nations of Europe together as one religion, despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affects everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund exists specifically for that reason.
The core of the Church's power remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this power and money bias raised questions about the legitimacy of the doctrine.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although these blockades violated international law, generally accepted by several international conventions of the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective in blocking vital military and civilian materials.
The British mined the pollution to prevent any ships from entering several maritime zones in their entirety, endangering even neutral ships.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, the Germans expected a similar response in unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the dominant trends in most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
Countries that had suffered the horrors and atrocities of the past through World War I prayed that they would never have to do so in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with four cents in his pocket, his entire fortune, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras, and each era in China, or ruling family, was distinguished by a dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a turbulent period of fragmentation into provinces, the best known of which is the Three Kingdoms period, the 60-year period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, there were fierce wars between the many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, when thousands died fighting for the highest seat on the Great Wall of Xi'an.
It had many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, the rise of nationalism and the idea that the state belongs to many rather than to one ruler.
And since the revolution, jobs have been opened up to all male applicants, paving the way for the most ambitious and driven to succeed.
And the same thing applies to the military, because instead of military ranks based on hierarchy, we now have ranks based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this afterlife, and he often used a cave known as Hira in the mountains of Noor for meditation.
The cave, which has withstood the ravages of time, is a very clear testimony to Muhammad's religious beliefs.
Perched on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows it exists, it's not easy to find, and once you're inside, you're completely isolated.
You can't see or hear the outside world in this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still in existence.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many massive pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of Death contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family.
The "up" and "down" signs look like V's, while the "down" and "up" signs look like staples or squares without a bottom.
Lifting means starting at the end of the bow and turning it on, and lowering means starting at the bowstring and turning it off.
The upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while the downstroke produces a stronger, more confident sound.
You can make your own markings with a pencil, but the bow markings that are drawn are for musical purposes and should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI of France, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the King's sister, Princess Elisabeth, were forcibly expelled from Versailles to Paris by a group of women workers on October 6, 1789.
The king and queen rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening them.
The crowds forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob shakes the head of the royal guard captain killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism used in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to pay back a large part of their expenses, and the bond issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street attracted attention.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the basic interests of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, we need to understand what led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the story takes place is usually called the High Middle Ages, which is the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history.
The High Middle Ages, which preceded the Late Middle Ages and preceded the Early Middle Ages, are conventionally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from a technological orientation or technological imperative to the precise meaning that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two concepts: that technological development itself has an influence beyond culture and politics, and that technology is not socially controlled but rather has an intrinsic ""influence"" on society".
For example, someone might argue that the automobile necessarily leads to better roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
In addition, more people owning vehicles increases the incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to new technological developments in the field of medical care to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had many elements of cultural determinism influenced by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
From a Romantic perspective, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and cultures associated with that geography grew, which were socially harmonious, and ultimately better than arbitrarily making and enforcing laws.
While Paris was known as the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Sachi's reputation as a hotspot began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, Constantinople's stature declined, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silks and spices, that were more valuable than what they could sell in Byzantine markets.
This is when the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early on, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But because of the slow exchange of information, the Western model could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to lock their clothes.
Subsistence farming is the practice of farmers producing only enough food to feed themselves and their families.
Biodynamic agriculture is a simple yet organic system that uses seeds native to an ecoregion through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel alienated by social norms, allowing them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that clearly distinguish a subculture include linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, and geographic elements, and may be a combination of these elements.
Members of subcultures often express affiliation through unique and iconic styles that include fashion, mannerisms, and certain slang.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the example of a small number of unfortunate children who were not socialized by adults during their formative years because of neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse.
These children are referred to as feral children. Some feral children are kept in captivity, often by their parents. In some cases, this childhood occurs because the parents cannot accept the child's severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some children were allegedly raised by animals, while others lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors that are almost entirely those of animals in need of special care, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is more of a learning method than an assistant. It provides assistance to people learning new things, such as using the latest computer programs or starting a new project.
Scissors can be both virtual and real, and to put it another way, a teacher can be a form of scissors, but they can also be a human being with a little Microsoft Office piece of paper.
Virtual structures are built into the software to ask questions, highlight and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Reasons for placing children in foster care vary widely, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Every child should grow up in a nurturing, protective, educational environment, and that's not the case.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide a safe home, loving care, reliable education, reliable health care.
Family trusts need to be able to provide all the essentials that traditional families don't.
The Internet has elements of both collective communication and human-to-human communication.
The distinct nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approaches.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socializing"" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995) "
Aimee and McCord (1998) investigated audience responses to websites and identified "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" as new motivational aspects.
Using video recording, he made important discoveries in the interpretation of subtle facial expressions and movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it claims to be able to accurately interpret subtle facial expressions to detect whether or not a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", demonstrated that people accurately perceived the sincerity of the speech even though they couldn't understand it due to brain damage.
He even suggested that this ability to analyze human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants that are either latent or emergent.
Mutation creates genes for a new species, while selection removes expressed genes from the grass.
Separation and recombination scramble the variation between the two gene pools with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
What's more, failure to do so has serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to access are leaves, beans and plant proteins, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are not only easily digested, but also provide high-quality protein with essential amino acids.
"All things considered, it would not be surprising if our ancestors solved the ""protein problem"" in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today".
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking someone up during their normal sleep period and then falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you set an alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can put it in the far corner of the room and it will wake you up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include consuming large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bedtime and forcing yourself to urinate.
The amount of equanimity a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of insecurity inherent in his body and soul.
The less stress you have, the more positive energy you will have in your life.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles standing in the way of this goal are our own inner restlessness and negative tendencies.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it's expanded from the ideas of love of the Mahayana Buddhists and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is theoretically very simple: it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
When you do Kundalini yoga, you awaken the Kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Visualizing various deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and as the war ended, the clash of systems, change and culture led to the decline of many nations.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The Cold War would last for the next 40 years and would be fought on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places by proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian front and rearm.
However, these plans were rendered useless almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties (both bilateral and multilateral).
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across oceans.
The mission of the navy has traditionally been to keep the nation well supplied with men and goods, but at the same time to prevent the enemy from supplying men and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when Americans tried to move men and resources across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which was dominated by U-boats, tried to stop this.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered England as well as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats seems to have begun about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Domesticated goats are generally grouped together on hills or pasture sites, often under the care of goat herders, mostly young or adolescent, better known as herders. This method of herding is still used today.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England in the early 16th century.
The roadway was just made of parallel wooden planks, but it still allowed horses to go faster and carry more cargo than the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced fairly early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it became clear that it was more efficient if the rails were on steel sleepers.
This became a common practice, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the carriage wear more.
Over time, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767, a railway with only rails was finally introduced.
The first form of transportation known to man was walking, and it wasn't until the emergence of Homo erectus two million years ago that humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, Australo-Pithecus, didn't habitually walk upright like they do.
Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago, but the earliest evidence of bipedalism comes from Australopithecus, which appeared between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce some of the suffering that we're going to have in the future.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases, but instead of a temporary solution, you have to find the source of the problem and disable it.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot with the development of human science and technology, and the problem has become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Clerk Charles Thomson.
During that night, 150 to 200 prints of what is now called the Dunlap Broadside were made.
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on July 8th in the front yard of the Independence Monument.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The handwritten original no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's still a lot about birds that makes them look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they stand on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
Most computers in use today use a method of manipulating information through binary coding.
A binary number can have only one of two values (that is, 0 or 1), and such numbers are called binary numbers or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms of systemic poisoning may not appear immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most obvious sign of botulism may be an open container of pharmaceuticals or toxic household chemicals.
Check the chart for specific first aid instructions for a particular poison.
The term "worm" is what entomologists call these kinds of insects that have a diet.
The term is derived from the earliest known insect known to parasitize humans, the mosquito.
Both pinworms and tapeworms are chronic insects that adapt to their hosts' nests and habitats.
Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults, has about 400,000 reported cases throughout the United States.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of either of them or the child.
These couples can also choose to adopt a baby.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually what drives most scientific research.
But an experiment is the elimination of one or more hypotheses, the asking of questions, the making of observations, leading to scientific investigation.
Museologists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
In psychology as well as in science, Aristotle's view of all matter was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on the existence of cycles of productivity and endurance mediated by the biological clock.
For most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, periodic rhythms are recorded, rather than simply responses to external periodic signals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that can keep cycling on its own even in the absence of external signals.
Hersh and Chase's experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA was the genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant bacteria into their DNA.
They did two experiments to look at the DNA in PAZ in the presence of radiolabeling or the proteins in PAZ in the presence of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of variation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in exploring nature to see the landscape, including plants, animals and wildlife.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and research on parks and ecosystems.
Traveling, photographing and learning about the Bornean orangutan is one example.
Every morning, people drive out of a small rural town to go to work, and they pass by other people going to work in the same town they just left.
This dynamic transportation shuttle will somehow connect everyone to and support a self-driving-based transportation system.
Now, scientific data shows that this large-scale carbon economy has driven biodiversity out of the steady state that helped humanity evolve over the last two million years.
Everybody participates in society, everybody uses the transportation system, and almost everybody complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality problems or collapsing bridges.
Why is the transportation system causing such dissatisfaction, why is it failing us every day, are all transportation engineers incompetent, or is something more fundamental at work?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range, so traffic flows have a fair amount of consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main properties of (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help us plan, design and operate our road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air, and their ability to do so helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus argued that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth, but many did not.
And it feels like the Earth is not moving, so at first glance, maybe that's true.
The Amazon is the second longest river on Earth and the largest, with more than eight times the water flow of the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long. The basin is formed by the confluence of thousands of small rivers.
Pyramid building continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, but the Pyramid of Giza was never surpassed in size or technological superiority.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monumental architecture of their ancestors, which was well over a thousand years old by the standards of the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and least populous country.
The Vatican City State uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the province, unlike Latin, which is often used in religious ceremonies.
Every citizen of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their natural forms and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was analogous to the four states of matter -- solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, in that order -- but Aristotle also theorized that they could be transformed into new pure matter that makes up what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain some non-metals, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that you could fit a few trillion of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
And so the pencil appeared, and the pencil remained a useful tool for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing systems, the pencil became less important.
Now people don't even have to be near a pencil sharpener to write messages on a computer screen.
People are just wondering what's going to happen with keyboards when something new comes along.
A fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes a lot of energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when you split the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split apart with very little or no outside influence.
"The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust".
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner below the maria and thicker below the plateaus.
Because the crust is thinner, there can be more maria on the near side. This is a condition that makes it easier for lava to rise above the surface.
Content theory focuses on what causes people to act in a certain way or lead them to act in a certain way.
These theories suggest that people have certain desires and needs that are internalized into adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want to do what they do and what it is about their environment that makes them want to do certain things and not do certain things.
Two popular contingency theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's causal theory.
"Generally, one of two behaviors can emerge when a manager begins to lead former colleagues: at one end of the spectrum, they try to remain ""one of the guys""".
This type of manager makes decisions that people don't like, disciplines them, evaluates their work, assigns responsibility, and has trouble holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're an unaware individual who thinks you have to change everything the team does and do it your way.
At the end of the day, the leader is responsible for the team's performance.
This behavior causes confusion between the submissive leader and the members.
Virtual teams maintain the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for real team members.
They often have more autonomy than incumbents because they can meet with teams on shift schedules that local management doesn't understand.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and Rapasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a distinctive component of a virtual team".
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. This team fits the criteria for each member.
Why do organizations go through this lengthy process of establishing learning communities?
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization's operations department, creativity and originality can flourish.
As a result, when organizations work together, the process of overcoming obstacles can lead to new, innovative processes for meeting customer needs.
For organizations to be innovative, leadership needs to create not only a culture of innovation, but shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) describes an approach called Continuum as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide the physical evidence needed when taking a theoretical approach to cognitive research. This narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior helps scientists study it.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
With the advent of new technologies, it has become possible to observe and investigate structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
This gives us a lot of information and data to build simulation models to help us understand mental processes.
AI is powerfully reminiscent of science fiction, but it's also a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of computers.
AI research involves the study of automating tasks that require machines to behave intelligently.
For example, handwriting, voice, and facial recognition, as well as control, planning, schedule management, and customer diagnostics and answering questions.
These have become a separate discipline focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, as seen in many home computer and video game software.
Fieldwork is a big part of every classroom. Usually, teachers want to take their students to a place where they don't need a bus ride.
Technology helps with virtual field learning, where students can sit in classrooms and look at museum exhibits, tour aquariums, and admire beautiful works of art.
Virtual field learning is a great way to look back and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their summer travels. Each year, the website is remodeled and the old version is left on an online server in the form of a scrapbook.
Blogs also help students improve their writing, which often starts with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogs also ""make students more attentive to their surroundings"" and make students smart and interesting through the need to capture the attention of an audience (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to expand their learning beyond traditional school life.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""enhances students' analytical and critical thinking by actively responding to Internet material and allowing students to define their own position in the writings of others and form their own views on a particular topic"" (Oravek, 2020)".
Ottawa is the charming capital of bilingual Canada, and its many art galleries and museums illuminate Canada's past and present.
The southernmost is home to Niagara Falls and the northernmost is home to untouched natural beauty such as Muskoka.
All of this makes Ontario stand out as what outsiders call the true Canada.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wastelands.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest and most untouched continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which changed Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It's bordered on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I encourage all female travelers to answer "married" regardless of whether they're actually married.
Wearing a ring also helps (cheap rings are best avoided).
Women need to know that cultural differences can result in what is considered harassment, and that acts like holding hands are not uncommon.
Don't be afraid to firmly reject men and stick to your guns (cultural differences or not, sarcasm cannot be ignored!).
The modern city of Casa Blanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt it as the city of Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established a trading post here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a variety of other items, but they're all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava eruptions from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's roads, especially in the downtown area.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you're visiting from the outside, you should do some research to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu.
It is also the base camp for Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla trekking and Nyiragongo volcano climbing.
You can get around Goma using mototaxis. The general (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a metaphor for an exotic and remote place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor village, but its fame has made it a tourist attraction, with an airport.
Because of the impact of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "The Wonders of Africa".
It's more Arab than African, so it's a stark contrast to other cities in Mali.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's landmarks, the flagship of the SANParks.
Like all South African national parks, the park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can be advantageous to buy a wild card that gives you access to specific South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the place that gave the name Hong Kong to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists as the main point.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering bar graph because of its clear reflection on the surface of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the development in Hong Kong's Bay Area is concentrated on the undeveloped land along the northern coast.
If you're looking for evidence of colonial past, this is a good place to start, because this is where the British colonial developers made their claim.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Himalayas in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Within this forest, a part corresponding to Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
It's not just a mangrove swamp, it's part of the last remnants of the great jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water and the Gangetic Plain.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer currently inhabit the region.
Buses run throughout the day from the local intercity bus station (across the river), but buses heading specifically to the east and Jakhar/Bumthang depart only between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, as buses are often fully booked.
In most districts, comfortable and sturdy small daily coaster buses operate.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby areas such as Faro (Nu 150), Funaka (Nu 200), etc.
The Oyapock River is spanned by a cable-stayed bridge. The bridge connects the Oyapock River with the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the two main towers is 83 meters, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge is closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoint will be completed.
The Guarani were a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer tribe who lived in the eastern part of present-day Paraguay.
The Chaco was home to other indigenous tribes, like the Waikuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Known as the "Giant of the Indies", Paraguay was born in the 16th century as a result of a mix of Spanish conquistadors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial era that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here.
For more information on the tournament and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set equal to the value of 1 British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, directly across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is commonly used throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
British and US currency can be used in the library area, but credit cards cannot be used. Please check with the owner in advance to determine what means of payment are accepted.
It's almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so change it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is a subtropical province, and in the summer, it's usually over 30 degrees Celsius.
Winters can be incredibly cold. Days below freezing are rare, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than it really is.
"Weather" and "drought" do not exist separately. Precipitation is about the same throughout the year".
While many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife.
No matter how manageable they may seem, wild boar, elk, moose, bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous.
Additionally, smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so keep your camp clean by not carrying or cooking smelly food.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave port.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk, and about 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village resulted in the death of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland straddles two harbours, it has a lot of beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore Beach faces the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
There are almost all sandy beaches where safe swimming is possible, and most of the beaches have many shady spots made by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is in the Waitematā Harbour, a suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually uncrowded family beaches, with lots of shops lining the shoreline, where it's safe to swim.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex flavor, but it's a nice, crisp beer.
There's a lot of French wine to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are also easy to come by.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily buy it.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of flat white coffee: a short black is an espresso, a cappuccino is whipped cream, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Although there are many trips to the reef throughout the year, injuries from these causes are rare on the reef.
Still, it's important to listen to the advice of those involved, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur on beaches and near estuaries from October to April 1770. They are occasionally found outside during this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most of them swim away because they're afraid of people.
The saltwater crocodile does not live in the sea, but inhabits estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have special offers for specific hotels, but they can also be used to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport pickup/drop-off, low-cost flights and hotels.
It also holds reservations for customers if they need time to decide or to obtain other documents (e.g. visas) for their destination.
However, if you have any changes or requests, please do not contact the hotel directly, but first contact your travel agent.
At some festivals, many music festival attendees decide to camp on the grounds, and most attendees consider camping a must-do experience.
If you want to be close to the fun and excitement, get there early and find a campsite close to the music.
And while the song on the main stage may be over, don't forget that music can play late into the night all over the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, it is a good idea to check the location of the cabin, as it makes a pretty terrible noise when passing through the ice sheet.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms and conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests, and they usually don't have windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They always have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep visitors coming back for more.
In some places, alcohol is served free of charge. However, since alcohol clouds judgment, all good gamblers know the importance of not getting drunk.
When attempting to drive over high altitude or mountain trails, consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads covered with ice and snow, friction is reduced so that you can't drive as well as if you were on asphalt.
When a blizzard blows, a lot of snow can fall in an instant.
Vision may also be limited by falling and scattering snow, water droplets, or frost on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, there are many countries where icy or snow-covered roads are the norm, and roads are largely unobstructed year-round.
The safari is probably the most spectacular tourist attraction in Africa and will be a highlight for many visitors.
The well-known phrase safari refers to an overland journey to see Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and they can be observed very well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can see them better with binoculars.
"Hiking safaris (also called ""bush walks"", ""hiking safaris"" or ""walk-throughs"") consist of hikes that can be done for several hours or days".
The Paralympic Games are scheduled to be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Having hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, it will be the only Asian city to host the Games twice.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the announcement, things can get a little tricky.
Refund regulations vary, but as of the end of March, most refund regulations due to the coronavirus have not been extended to the Olympic period in July 2020.
Ticket prices for most events range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with a typical ticket price around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry more quickly. Many hotels have a rental rack and rack, even if they don't have one in the room.
Maybe you don't like wearing leggings or you don't like wearing socks with leggings, in which case, if you have a hair dryer, here's how to use it.
Be careful not to get the nucleus too hot (it can shrink or draw).
There are other ways to purify water, some of which are more effective for certain hazards.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute. In other areas it is necessary to boil water for several minutes.
Water filters vary in their effectiveness, but if you're concerned about your water quality, we recommend buying a reputable brand.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are uncommon in the areas where they live.
Pests can cause food to spoil, cause inflammation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or carry infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping offers the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain areas.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially when buying liquor and cigarettes.
Located in isolated mountainous terrain, the road between Point Marion and Fairmont is known as one of the most difficult to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway.
If you're unfamiliar with country roads, beware of steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and within those sections speed compliance is much more important than other sections.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than at many other points along this route, like Pennsylvania Way.
German pastries are pretty good, and Bavaria, like its neighbor to the south, Austria, has lots of butter and variety.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are used year-round, and cherries and raspberries are often used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a small bread with a strong flavor, try this bread, called Berliner, Pankuchen, or Krappen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on medicinal herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
"Carré can be ""straight"" or ""curly"" depending on the amount of water".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is a comprehensive term that encompasses a variety of local dishes from across the country of 17,000 islands.
However, when taken one step further and used without limitation, the term originally tended to mean the food of the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simple iron dishes, the main spices preferred by Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
A backrest is a support for the rider's legs extended on both sides of the saddle.
This gives the rider a lot more stability, but it can be a safety issue because the foot can get caught.
If a rider falls off the horse and steps on the rail, or if the horse runs away, they can be dragged there, and there are a number of safety precautions that can be taken to minimize this risk.
First, most riders wear narrow, flat-soled shoes with heels.
Next, some saddles, especially British saddles, have a safety bar that allows the saddle leather to fall from the saddle if the falling rider is pulled back.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing area, known as the Yosemite Valley of South America, with large volcanic rock walls and a variety of rocky mountains.
There's a breathtaking view from the top of the mountain, and climbers from all over the world keep finding new routes in nature's infinite potential.
Cross-country skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"A ski trip is a form of travel enjoyed by enthusiasts, called "ski bums", who plan their vacation around continuous skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old; cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5000 BC.
The sport of cross-country skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational ski club founded in 1861 by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This activity is related to, but usually excludes, alpine-style ski touring and mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steeper terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can go a little farther than walking, but without a well-maintained track and a heavy backpack, you won't be able to match the speed of cross-country skiing.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and usually traveling between them means having to go through multiple visa applications and passport checks.
However, the Schengen zone functions somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means that you don't have to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There's no universal definition of an antique, and some developing countries classify products that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
Compared to Europe, North America shows a shorter geographical difference in the age that defines an antique.
Handcrafted products may not be as old as their mass-produced counterparts, but they can still be defined as antiques.
Reindeer herding is one of the most important livelihoods for the Sami people, and the culture is also important for many other actors in trade.
Traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but most of them raised reindeer as pack animals and made a living from fishing and hunting.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sápmi.
It is widely used, especially among non-Roma, but the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive because it gives a negative stereotype and inaccurate perception of Roma people.
If a country you're visiting becomes a travel warning area, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance could be affected.
You may want to listen to your government's advice rather than your own, but every government's advice is tailored to its own people.
