This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had paddle-like fins, a long-held theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional representation.
Scientists report that the fins of these lizards were chestnut-brown in spots, with an orange tint on the inside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of fins in the sea.
Because dinosaur fins had a highly developed shaft, called a rachis, but other types of fins called barbels and barbules, researchers had assumed that the rachis resulted from a more recent evolutionary development of these other fins.
The structure of the fins suggests that they were not used for hunting but to regulate temperature and to display them to other animals.The researchers say that although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows fins from a large animal, not a small one.

In France, voting has always been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, leaving a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the choice to the candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the Christian voter, he or she puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.

Candidates can send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, with specific procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists appear to be crossing a dangerous line by publishing photos of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is prosecuting the case, told reporters it would not comment further until the charges were laid.
The document, according to the leak, deals with the border dispute, flying over Palestine on the basis of the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics likely to be discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel wants a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shots in the supplemental disinfestation process were to be carefully supervised by rangers, while the process was monitored and effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Chicken Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited into the Sporting Chicken Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Recreation with NPWS, the four dogs selected for the first shooting operation received full safety training and instruction.
Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) made up of newly elected councillors.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission called for the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four Christians with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious".
The minister responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also issued a tsunami warning.
A Filipino Christian former policeman kidnapped Hong Kong tourists and hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several bodies have been recovered and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six exhibits, including children and elderly Christians, were displayed in the annex, as well as Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly Christian woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps, working in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Children's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying primate behavior in his spare time.
Her research proved that administering a hormone slows the maturation of the fetal lungs of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box"" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was my first drag queen. She was my first manager. Luna died on Monday night. She was one of a kind. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as quiet as I was... maybe even louder... I love her and I'll miss her... maybe she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agreed that they wanted Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his welfare was called into question.
He cannot take painkillers because they are forbidden by the Games.
On June 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software from early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply along with other organic materials that form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the courtesies "political gossip and flattery".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airlines to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
No other transport is being maintained and elevated trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and interchange facilities will not be available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of lizard in the equatorial Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden say that nine species evolved in two generations, although this process would have taken thousands of years, due to interbreeding between a Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the cactus red ground finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be ground into small pieces.
It can be drawn into thin wires, then twisted and rolled. It can be beaten or worked into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin, and placed on top of other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level is affected by the amount of hydrogen ions (the water in the pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which protons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and then, with clean hands, form a baḍḍa.
The moisture on the hands will react with the outer layers, which will be strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of funnel systems have been found in the Minoan city-states of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women sat together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, the signal transmission is done through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet (30 m) high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the bicycle has done for us is provide faster and easier transportation.
Neither do trains, cars, and other modes of transportation.
Below these are medium-sized jackals that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including house cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and lizards.
The secret to its success is the niche concept, a special job each jet has that keeps it out of competition with other jets.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups called prides.
The adults consist of one to three fully grown and related males, and up to thirty females and juveniles.
The children are usually related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and sons.
Lion tamers behave much like wolf or dog tamers, animals that resemble lions (but not other types of frogs) in behavior, and are very deadly to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, make red jumps, and lift five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but like a phrase of hollow words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the feeding frogs (prey) in the sky, picking up where they left off on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very quietly as well. Ocelots hunt prey by blending into the environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as by going up a mountain or river, or moving to a new island from which it cannot easily return) it often finds itself in a different environment than where it was before.
This new environment will have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than previously required.
The original population hasn't changed at all, we need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be said to be the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. release into the atmosphere).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We do most of our business with plants and make most of our food from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, rivalled only by other mosasaurs.
The long jaws had as many as 70 incisors, with more in the lower jaw, meaning there was no way to bite through the shoulder blades.
It is uncertain, but it may have retained its forked tongue.
It was quick to attack anything it could drag into the water; even a dinosaur as large as T. rex was no match for it.
Although almost anything that the Romans ate could be eaten, the Romans also feasted on what may seem strange foods: they ate pigs, turkeys, buffalo, and a type of rodent called a muskrat.
Another reference was that while the poor and children ate seated in chairs, the rich men liked to feast with their knees bent while eating their meals.
The ancient Romans exported food from Europe to the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they ate corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their deities, considered the home of that deity.
The people sacrificed to the gods and the priests attempted to appease the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Some botes built special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home heating is so important.
Much of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; wells were outdoor benches jutting out into the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was settled less extensively. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished to Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, the Cimmerian tribes were already living there.
Although each nation was in Scandinavia, there were many differences between the people, kings, traditions, and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the National Treasure sign, you might think that a treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There are, however, some drawings on the back of the document, as well as a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of June 4, 1776". The text appears at the end of the document, below.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that when it first appeared, this large vellum document (about 116 cm by 96 cm) was rolled up for safe-keeping.
However, it is also possible that the annotation here was attached only as a plaque.
The arrival of D-Day and the battles that followed had liberated northern France, but the south was still free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy". These were French Christians who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing into Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture that belongs to a large number of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in some ways defines the size of a society.
City-states arose before nation-states. A civilized culture means the passing of knowledge across generations, a long cultural imprint, and some expansion.
Smaller cultures often disappear and leave behind some historical records and may be known as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states created a weak, all-Congress central government under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, which often aided it, to enforce its acts.
One even had authority to legislate taxes and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states had such a strong opinion of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the world's seventh largest island.
Because of its island groups, Japan has historically been called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Formosa, meaning "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of the island, beginning a transformation in early Aboriginal production practices and hiring Chinese labourers to work in the sugar and rice fields.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size when the analog film era ended.
It is still made today, but mainly its aspect ratios have been captured by image sensors in digital cameras.
The so-called 35 mm format is somewhat confusing because it is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The ratios in this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) are defined as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or fairly close to this relationship.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is merely a guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
He finds that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into straight and horizontal stripes (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was brought under control.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion held European nations together, despite their differences in language and tradition.
He wielded power over everyone, from the king down to ordinary Christians.
One of the most important principles of the Church is to use wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and Church monies are set aside for this specific purpose.
The church's central authority remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in a series of international treaties over several centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from crossing back into full sections of the ocean, causing damage to neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of many citizens and nations were toward peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations were eager to avoid a similar fate in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former business manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods in time; each phase in China or each dynasty in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was an unstable period of divided provinces, the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were internecine wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a move towards absolutism and republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Later, after the revolution, the occupations were opened to all male candidates and allowed the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applied to the military because military ranks were now based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired other oppressed peoples and working classes in other nations to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in other things besides his own mundane life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which still exists, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
On top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the outside world.
In fact, one can easily find it even if one knows it exists; once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
One sees nothing but a clear blue sky above and the mountains above. Inside the cave one sees and feels a little bit of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is in red), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward-pointing sign looks like a V and the "downward-pointing" sign looks like a paperclip or a square without a base.
Above means you start at the bottom and work your way up, and below means you start at the base (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is louder and more decisive.
You can write your own notes in pencil, but remember that the printed notes on the bow are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their four children (Marie-Thérèse aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 because of a child abuse scandal.
In a carriage, they traveled to Paris accompanied by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the court shook his head at a royal guard at Versailles in front of the distraught queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine Islands were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to support most of their expenses, and bond yields fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the super-profits gained from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the principal gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The years in question are commonly referred to as the "Dark Ages", the period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The word technological determinism means much the same in practice, from technological change to technological imperative, which means that the distinction between the two is inevitably tied to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Two general ideas that many interpretations of technological determinism share: that the development of technology itself does not depend on cultural or political influence; and that technology has inherent "effects" on societies, rather than socially conditioned effects.
It stands to reason that one could say that the invention of the motor car forced the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible with just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Now almost everyone has a car. This causes many accidents on the roads, and therefore new techniques are invented in medicine to cure addicted Christians.
Romanticism introduced a strong element of cultural determinism, pioneered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, which were in harmony with the place in society, were better than arbitrarily set laws.
Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, just as Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as an epicenter of luxury, beginning in the year 400 BC until the year 1100 BC.
Its importance declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during this period that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Originally, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles were delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses seed saved in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase production.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures enrich fellow Christians who have strayed from society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic of the era, ethnicity, class, position, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture so distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, including fashion, mannerisms, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, abuse, or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some feral children were abandoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases this abandonment was caused by the parents' rejection of a child with severe brain or physical problems.
Feral children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are said to have been raised by wolves; others are said to have spent their lives alone in the wild.
If saved only by charity, the savage child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) similar to those of the charity that saved him, such as shyness or indifference to Christians.
Project-based instruction makes learning easier and more interesting, but packaging goes a step further.
Markup is not a method of learning, but a support tool for people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Bookmarks can be virtual or real: a bookmark may be a form of bookmark, but so is a Microsoft Office wizard.
Virtual bookmarks are built into the software and have the function of asking, prompting, and monitoring procedures that may be too difficult for a single student.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse or mistreatment.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and educational, but they are.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and safe health care.
Foster care is designed to meet any needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken and removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal demand.
The Internet has distinctive characteristics, which can add other dimensions to user experience and satisfaction.
For example, "learning"" and ""socialization"" may be important goals for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) found two new ideal aspects: "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships", when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to many important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, the millisecond-long facial movements.
Above all, it is said that one can detect if a Christian is cheating by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, suggested that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage may still assess sincerity accurately.
It also suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior are also possessed by domestic animals such as herding dogs.
Research in the 20th century proved that there are four groups of genetic variation: cumulative and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection purges the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination increase the variation back and forth between the two breeds for each generation.
Outside of the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino acid needs by obtaining them from available plant resources.
Then, the inability to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources are the proteins available in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for primates to digest as other foods are cooked.
In contrast, food animals (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide ample protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep paralysis is a process of falling asleep during a normal period of sleep and waking up again after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to give you awareness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you change your alarm clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you can get up in the morning to set it.
Other biorhythm-based options call for drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a diuretic) before bedtime, so one should rush to urinate.
The greater a Christian's amount of inner peace, the less the amount of tension in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded through Mahayana Buddhism and various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, which visualizes various deities, clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II and led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States; by the end of the war the contradictions of system, process, and culture led to the division of the states.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years and was fought in earnest, by representative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and their only hope was to withdraw and regroup near the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Russian Army crossed and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is arguably the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
The navy's job is to ensure that the nation maintains the ability to move troops and supplies, while at the same time impeding the enemy's ability to move its troops and supplies.
One of the most prominent recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States sought to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using only the U-boat, attempted to interdict this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Carp appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising pigs for milk, wool, meat, and wool.
Domestic rabbits were usually kept in herds that roamed the countryside or other pastures, often the herds were kept by shepherds who were often young or small, similar to the more famous pasture.
Stagecoaches were built in the 16th century in England.
Although the wagons were made of parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses and thus carried heavier loads and traveled faster than the older, more paved roads.
Wooden beams were soon used to hold the routers upright, and it was gradually realized that the routers would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
It became commonplace, but iron caused more wear than wood on wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron railway appeared in 1767.
The earliest form of transport was walking, and humans began walking two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, generally did not walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join environmental movements, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
This is only a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed due to human technological and scientific advancement, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and people's strange lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap copies".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
However, there are many species of lizards that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best indication of internal contamination may be the presence of an open medicine chest or household products containing toxins.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists formally use the chemical term for these groups of insects.
The word is used because they are related to bed bugs, which are well adapted to infest Christians.
Assassin bugs as well as bed bugs are brood parasites, meaning that they nest either in nests or where their hosts live.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among both adults and children.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A spoon may mean that raising a child is not in the mother's or father's best interests.
These parents can choose an adoption plan for the child.
In adoption, the biological father and mother forfeit their parental rights so that another spouse can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which underlies much of scientific inquiry.
It is not the only one: experimentation, and an experiment is evidence used to eliminate as many hypotheses, assumptions, and observations as possible from scientific inquiry.
The naturalist and philosopher relied on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
When knowledge of the Greek language was eventually lost, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many believe that physiological rhythms and behavior often depend significantly on the presence of circadian rhythms and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply periodic external signals and reactions, have been documented for nearly all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillations that continue a free-cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was a major clue that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments by targeting either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bacterium with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have very different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the type of genetic material affected or whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are passionate about visiting natural areas to relax with nature, such as wild plants and animals.
Some examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, rock climbing, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the country towns to go to work and meet other people working in the place they started from.
This means that everyone is connected to a transportation system that relies on private cars, thus increasing it.
Science now suggests that this large carbon economy changed the biosphere from one of stable states that aided human evolution over the past two billion years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are heard in developed countries.
Why do so many transportation systems break down, why do they fail every day? Are all transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because the behaviors of drivers cannot be predicted with two hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers appear to behave rationally; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, the relationship must be established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These kinds of relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road services.
Insects were the first mammals to fly. The ability to fly helped them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their bodies.
This gives us plenty of places for predators to congregate.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some thought it had rings but many people thought the opposite: that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (as well as other stars).
This makes sense because the Earth doesn't seem to move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide at some points.
Twenty percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued into the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed for their size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in official laws and communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times, since these can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four states of matter (in this order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, so he also theorized that they would change with new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more elements. Note that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as potassium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Sadly, as newer writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People now type messages on a computer screen, without needing to get used to a timer.
One can only wonder what a keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart over a cliff, splitting the core behind it and releasing a lot of energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus which means that they tend to split with little or no change.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the oceans.
There may have been more on the near side because the crust is thinner; it was easier for lava to accumulate on the surface.
Content theories focus on the discovery of what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow into adults.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes us want to do the things they do and what it is about their environment that makes us want to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, when leaders begin to connect with former peers, one of two behaviors may occur: One side of the spectrum attempts to restore "one of the children".
This type of leadership has difficulty making ethical decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and maintaining people's trust.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels they have to change everything about the team and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams will maintain the same standards of excellence as mainstream teams, but there are a few differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than municipal team managers because their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also the unique component of a virtual team.
The "feasibility team" is the management team that each member reports to. The feasibility team decides the requirements for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all applicable resources are used successfully in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can be seen.
As a result, the process of working together within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative process to serve customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation, sharing organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) outlines the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a high level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to blending cognition, thereby narrowing and refining the research area.
The correlation between mental pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us enough information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the internal processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation within a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and organization, the ability to respond to diagnosis and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These have developed into separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to problems in everyday life.
The NA system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is also built into many home computer and video game software applications.
School trips are important for these types of classes, and teachers often like to take students on trips that cannot be made by bus.
Technology provides the solution for virtual tours. Students can view artifacts in museums, go to the aquarium, or view fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to their trip to the nation's capital. Each year the website is updated, but old versions are kept online to serve as sketches.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and writing, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to suggest improvements in writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to enhance learning even beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of the blog "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' writings as well as define their own perspectives toward a particular issue (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's largest bilingual capital city and is home to many art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north are Muskoka and other natural wonders.
All of these and more emphasize that Ontario is considered the substance of forestry Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Levantine Islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the Levantine coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and one of the smallest continents in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and popular as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which became firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape to India route.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are required to say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to perceived harassment, but it is not uncommon for men to be harassed, groped, etc.
You have to be rigid about rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Myrmidons as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In Old Medina, it is easier to find places that sell typical Moroccan products, such as noodles, pots, fish products, hookahs and a variety of structures, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from Nyiragongo volcano that filled most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, the above visits should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for hikes to Nyiragongo volcano or for treks through Africa's least-protected areas to see mountain gorillas.
Boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to travel to Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the shortest ride.
Along with its relative accessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite having a reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country's cities, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with its own wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is regarded as the pride of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all of South Africa's National Parks, there are guards and day cares for the park.
You may also be eligible to purchase a Wild Card, which grants entry to a selection of South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where many tourists think of as the main point.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering ribbon that is evident from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and walk across to Kowloon Beach.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is where British colonization took place and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Surdaban is the world's largest mangrove belt coastline, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the India-Bangladesh coast.
The Surdabans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water bodies.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 cheetahs in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, and most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart at 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese tourist buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby resorts, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 m (272 ft) high, the bridge is 378 m (1,214 ft) long and has two lanes each 3.5 m (12 ft) wide.
The height of passage under the bridge is 15 metres. It was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Until the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay managed to retain much of its character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also be played at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), with values equivalent to the British Pound (GBP).
Deaf people can be scanned at the islands' only bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West Store.
British pounds are commonly accepted elsewhere on the islands and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
In the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted; check with the owners first to find an acceptable payment system.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your dollars before leaving.
Because Montevideo lies south of the Equator, it is hot in the Northern Hemisphere and cold in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo has a sub-tropical climate; temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no "too rainy" or "too dry" season: the amount of rainfall is the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are generally wild animals and should not be fed or destroyed.
Park authorities recommend a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Although they may look like hyenas, bison, elk, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of tourists are trampled to death for failing to keep their distance.
Also remember that noise attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking noise-causing food and keep the area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a major naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All but one of the British ships were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau Mau's organised struggle for independence, a peaceful demonstration in the town led to the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland lies between the two harbours, and the main Christian areas are in the three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, with pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
Also note that the beaches are full of families and there are plenty of places to buy what you need near the sea.
The most important local beer is called "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to try, but it is easiest to find wines from New Zealand and Australia.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're not careful.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign; the usual short shot is an "espresso", the cappuccino is served with plenty of cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Trips to the Curaçao Barrier Reef are organized throughout the year and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, according to the advice of the authorities, obey the signs and be careful at the safety abyss.
Sea wasps are found near the beaches and estuaries of the plains from October to April north of 1770; during these periods they can sometimes be found out of the water.
There are sharks that very rarely attack Christians. Most sharks avoid Christians and swim away.
Sea cucumbers do not actively swim in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, tourists can be assured of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destinations.
Travel agents often list specific hotels, although it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or inquiries should first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp there, and many attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early to find a place to camp near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music in the main parks has ended, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic by sea, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice produces an avalanche quite horrible for sensitive Christians.
Cruises to St. Petersburg involve spending a significant amount of time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos have been known to try to maximize the time and energy of their patrons. There are generally no clocks or windows, and finding one can be difficult.
To keep patrons happy and not leave the premises, casinos usually have good food, drink, and entertainment specials.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, being drunk does not get you high, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
If you must drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes you should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very cold temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low and cannot be driven as if on normal asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a short period of time that you get stuck.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow, sleet, or ice on car windows.
However, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the prime time for many visitors.
The word "safari" in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the extraordinary wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to get close to machines and, with the right equipment, can be well carved.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwalking safari, bushwal
The Paralympics were held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some matches held in other cities across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympics in the country (the first was hosted in 1964).
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the position was announced, you may find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies can vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not include the end of July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can be useful for drying them. In many hotels it is possible to borrow a board and iron even if they are not present in the room.
If iron is not available, or if you are not interested in ironed socks, you can use wire, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the tissue, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
There are many different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific contaminants.
In some areas, stirring the water for a minute may be sufficient, in other environments it may take longer.
The effectiveness of filters can vary and, if in doubt, consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter parasitic worms that are unknown in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases or dangerous organisms that can injure or kill Christians by force usually do not qualify as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is a method of purchasing goods without paying duty or excise in certain locations.
Direct travel to countries with a heavy taxation system can sometimes be very expensive, especially for products such as alcohol or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it traverses many isolated dirt tracks.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: there are many steep slopes and narrow streets and curves.
The speed limits are lower than those of the preceding and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and compliance is very important.
Surprisingly, cell phone service works better here than in other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
Both German dishes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, especially the year-round apple and summer cherry and plum varieties.
Many desserts are also made with walnuts, hazelnuts, and other nuts; the most popular cakes often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try something small but very tasty, try something called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry may be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term usually refers to the food originating in the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is based on simple ingredients. The predominant flavours preferred by Javanese are nutmeg, pepper, sugar (mainly Javanese cane sugar) and various spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that pinch the sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider, but can have safety issues because the rider's feet can get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but has one foot embedded in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse continues to run. To reduce this risk, various safety precautions can be taken.
For starters, riders wear riding boots with a fairly narrow and smooth heel and sole.
Also, some chess sets, especially English chess sets, have safety rails that cause the heart staff to fall if pulled behind the falling knight.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a wide variety of granite peaks and cliffs.
Very good views can be seen from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly adding new layers to their potential infinity of peaks.
Snowboarding sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing down slopes with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski boomers", planning vacations solely to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skis date back to 5000 BC!
Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 some Norsemen formed the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski trekking: This activity is also called downhill skiing, ski mountaineering or ski hiking.
It is similar to (but usually does not include) alpine style skiing or climbing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, longer distances can be covered than when walking, but very rarely can the same speeds as cross-country skiing be achieved without a heavy backpack on the beaten track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel from one country to another would require visas and passport control.
In this sense, the Schengen Area functions as if it were a single country.
Provided there are arrests within this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to travel to each member country of the Schengen Area separately and thus waste time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that says handmade items are antiques; some tax agencies define antiques as items that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi and the surrounding agricultural trade is also important for other occupations.
However, even historically, not all Sámi have always kept deer, but for survival they engaged in activities such as fishing, hunting and the like and used deer as target practice.
Today, many Sámi have modern jobs, and tourism is a major source of income in Sámi areas.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma people.
If the country you want to visit becomes subject to a travel warning, your travel insurance or cancellation policy may change.
You can also see the flaws of governments other than your own, even if those flaws are felt by the citizens of the corresponding country.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than European or Arab citizens.

Rip currents are the return flow of waves crashing onto a beach, usually a coral reef or similar feature.
Due to the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections where a fast current can form towards the deeper water.
Most deaths are due to exhaustion, as people try to swim back to shore against the current, which is impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a place where there is no more current or, depending on your abilities or if someone sees you, you can wait for rescue.
