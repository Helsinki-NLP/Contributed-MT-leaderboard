USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and acknowledges the full need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree wholeheartedly that the interests of our athletes and the USOCs and the sports they represent, can best be served by desegregation rather than moving forward with meaningful change within our organization.
United States Gymnastics is an independent state that supports how light can shine on distortions by proportions described so eloquently by Larry Nassar's children that cannot be detected for so long and imposes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal - to make the sport of gymnastics, and other athletes, as safe as possible in a safe, positive and empowering environment to pursue their dreams.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski served as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and then the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but details fossils typically cannot such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was brown on top with a yellow or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other traits of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers hypothesized the rachis likely evolved later in evolution than the other traits.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were used for temperature regulation or display rather than in flight. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and is not a female.
The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and is not a female.
Another bombing at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey killed two police officers and wounded more than twenty people early this morning.

Much of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made with the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be due to tidal forces between the Milky Way's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon causes tides on Earth, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a type of halo around a galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Mole discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of Southern Africa.
In an interview he said that the new variant was "much more troublesome and dangerous because of the very high mortality rate".
Dr. Mol suspects that some patients may have contracted the bug at the hospital, and that at least two were healthy hospital workers.
An infected person can infect 10 to 15 thousand people in a year.
Although the percentages of XDR-TB among all groups of people with TB are still low, it is estimated that 6000 out of 330000 people infected in South Africa at any given time have XDR-TB.

They are cooler than the surface of the planet during the day and warmer at night.
Glenn Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona said "Its thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain fairly constant temperatures, but is consistent with having a deep hole in the ground".
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in a pre-printed sheet of paper that shows the candidate of their choice on it.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes other than those duly counted and authorized for voters have been added.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance, following specific procedures.

Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his tour guide at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He is in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be punitive as his image has been widely published.
This is common practice in Britain but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee Notes notes "journalists walk a dangerous line in publishing photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute, which the Palestinians want based on the pre-1967 war borders.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem which is holy to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley, despite once agreeing to sign an agreement.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Qualified volunteers were recruited, in partnership with NPW and under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the Sporting Shooters Association of Australasia (NSWA) Inc.
According to Mick O'Fallon, acting director of parks preservation and heritage with the NPW, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
A new nine-member Central Election Council (CEC) was sworn in yesterday.
This will be Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a commission of inquiry recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country to new elections bodies.
The commission was Martelli's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported to have overheated, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said 27 accidents related to these devices had been reported.
Last week, Matty's announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "unprecedented".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami signal.
A former Filipino policeman holds Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have escaped and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Later photographers replaced one of the heads because it had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was locked up.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins had begun investigating premature labor during her spare time while she was working at the hospital.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the maturation of the child's fetal lungs.
Sinhoi said government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnell commented, "Luna was as strange as I was...maybe more so...love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australians becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people in the survey share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of the extremists surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
Toure was due to win Olympic gold medals in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been in doubt due to his complaints.
He has been unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain as he has been banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may possibly be the source of the delivery of water to Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the very first Earth.
53, Cuomo began his governorship earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political flattery and stupidity".
He has been projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly smaller distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
This is the use of satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is carried and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there is no car parking and park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Fears of transport shortages raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process took much longer due to breeding between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortipes, and a migrant cactus.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be turned into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn in sheet wire, which can be twisted and pleated. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and trapped in other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can make an indicator using the juice of red clover.
Grapefruit juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that were stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
Swirl the two dry powders together and then, with clean hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel moist and form a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathing houses where men and women lived together in mixed company.
When you're calling someone who's a thousand miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then return it almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sights.
It takes a giant rocket 100 feet high to place satellites or telescopes in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing about the wheel for us is what we see as very easy and fast transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized beetles that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small beetles (including the loose-limbed pet beetle) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a specialized job each cat holds that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social animals, living in large groups called guides.
The prairie is composed of one to three related adult males, plus thirty females and cubs.
A female extended family consisting of daughters and sons are loosely related to each other.
The lion acts much like a prairie collie or a pack of dogs, the animals being surprisingly similar to lions (but other large cats), and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, tigers can climb (though not perfectly), jump exceptionally long distances and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Pantera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four animals that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but like the roar of a crocodile, shouting words.
Ocelots (a medium-sized wild cat) prefer to eat small animals. If they can, they will capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals that an ocelot preys upon are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe the occults followed and hunted the animals for food by scent, sniffing for where they were on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with binocular vision, and can also move very stealthily. Ocelots mate with their prey, then raise their own young.
When a non-native group (a small population) of living things becomes separated from the main population (such as if they move to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new populations will require different amenities or adaptations that will require them to be stronger competitors than they were previously.
The native populations have not changed at all, they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and gardens from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were the supreme hunters of their time, so it scared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were fitted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth with an extra set in its mouth palate, meaning it had no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included lions, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may also have been a cannibal.
It did this to anything that entered the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex would have been no match for it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans' diet included artificial or unusual feast items called wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, rich men preferred to have a banquet together where they would lounge at their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman food may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered the house of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle Ages, houses were not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; stores had open counters overlooking the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was reduced. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The text appears below the document, upside down.
While no one knows who wrote it, what is known is that in his lifetime, large parchment documents (he measured 241‚ÅÑ2 inches by 293‚ÅÑ4 inches) were rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, codenamed &quot;Operation Dragoon&quot;.
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was turning over organs.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who collectively make up and function a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civicus, meaning civil, the Latin civitas, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines the shape of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization implies the passing of knowledge across many generations, a cultural footprint, and impartial diffusion of culture.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States for the first time formed a weak central government - along with Congress - the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities, who were often incompetent to enforce all its acts.
It had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
Amendments to the Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be enacted and the states dissolved the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the German national football team, the world's second most successful team and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, eye hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/clustering of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, where European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes in aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main structures at Machu Picchu, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed on the edges of the complex to give tourists an idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size close to the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) equal or approximately approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-touted and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while keeping the scale of arrangement in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
European history in this period under investigation was dominated by the Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful.
Christianity had bound European states together for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Power without representation affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the major Christian tenets is that money should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering and that church monetary funds should be exclusively for good causes.
The central authority of the Church remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether or not this principle would ever be fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by numerous international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the sea, which also posed a threat to neutral shipping.
As there was limited response to the Ich tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing view of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations resolved to avoid such a scenario in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America for a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each phase of China or each dynasty that held power had a specific dynasty.
This was accompanied by an unstable era of provinces divided between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This period was marked by fierce wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands killed for occupying the highest seat in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There were numerous social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to any single ruler.
Also after the revolution professions were open to all male applicants which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
For the same army this meant that the army's rankings were now based on its caliber rather than being based on class.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions as well.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) for his contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on a prominent peak of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, finding it is not simple, even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is a complete isolation.
The clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen as well as nothing else. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt contains numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), numerous small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper bow mark looks like a V and the &quot;lower bow mark&quot; looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Upper means one should start from one's tip and push the bow, and lower means one should start from the frog (where one's hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a somewhat softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more vocal.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember that printed bend marks are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, he returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting against the king and queen.
The crowd forced each king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
His American colonial regime was forced to pay taxes in order to pay a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through his Wall Street banking house.
Undoubtedly, the super profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the core gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The ages in which events took place in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) are commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are conventionally dated to end around 1500.
The main meaning from advancing technology or technological imperative is that human destiny is learned from the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their expression in technology. Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a large range of ideas in practice.
Most interpretations of technocentrism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a trend away from its own cultural or political impact, and instead is an "impact" on the underlying societies rather than a socially conditioned technology.
One might say for example that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network would only partly help finance cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Road accidents largely result from car ownership, which has led to the invention of new technologies in health care for broken objects.
Libertarianism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of libertarianism, geography shaped the individual, and over time those geography-related customs and cultures emerged, and these, being suited to the society's location, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, similarly Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Its fame as being comfortable lasted until about 1100 AD and began to decline in 400 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silks and spices that were more expensive than the prices in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially the costume was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own styles. One of the biggest events of the time resulted in the Crusades when people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system, that uses seeds saved for ecoregion in conjunction with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that uniquely determine a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through specific and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and logic.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse while they were growing up.
Such children are called "passive" or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their adoptive parents); in some cases the abandonment of these children resulted from the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may experience severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are alleged to have domesticated animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children's behavior (within physical limits) displayed almost entirely special care-animal behaviors, such as fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, an instruction is a form of scaffolding but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded into the software and are meant to question, hint and explain processes that can be challenging for students to handle alone.
It can be used to demonstrate and practice problem solving in mathematics in front of the whole class.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs they lacked in the home that they first did.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs they lacked in the home that they first did.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal communication and goods.
In the case of usage and experiential approaches to the characteristics of the Internet and other dimensions take part.
&quot;Learning&quot; and &quot;socialization&quot; are suggested, for example, as important motivations for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
&quot;Personal involvement&quot; and &quot;continuous connection&quot; were also identified as new motivation dimensions by Ehme and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying or not by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper The Presidential Speech that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to correctly assess sincerity.
They also suggested that similar abilities in interpreting human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Isolation and recombination shift variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savanna, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their own amino-acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the proteins available in leaves and films, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they have been cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, eggs, larvae) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of purposefully staying awake during one's normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to rouse oneself to consciousness without waking oneself up at all.
If your loved one is able to reset the clock themselves in their sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room from which they can get out of bed to turn their clock off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which requires forcing the person to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a single person has is inversely related to the amount of stress on their body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Each individual can attain enlightenment. Only one thing stands in the way of this goal, and that is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and several techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
If one stops seeing everything else in one's own peripheral vision, or does not see enough motion, staring at a single point can effectively have the same problem.
The central deity of Tibetan meditation is Yoga. The philosophy of the various deities is to cleanse the energy veins, activate the chakras and create enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, with cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war the country was left out due to the clash of systems, processes and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were no longer enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought virtually, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
However, this rendered the plans obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans is by far the most efficient method.
The function of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was trying to intercept this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as they had the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often similar to the more widely known herders, who are often children or adolescents. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in the 16th century in England.
Although the wagonways consisted only of parallel planks of wood, their horses allowed them to gain more speed and pull more loads than the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Crossties had been started much earlier to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, though, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if there was an iron bar at the top.
This became common, but the iron made the wagons wear more on the wooden wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known transport was on foot, humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man) around two million years ago.
They did not walk upright as their predecessor, Australopithecus, had done.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Saalanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living eco-friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to reduce future suffering.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must neutralize them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlop broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop broadsides still extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document. No original manuscript copy has survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not understand his dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs today.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their high two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common that no immediate diagnosis can be made.
The best sign of indoor poisoning may be open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term has been met with skepticism, as it may be adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin-bugs and bed-bugs are both nest parasites that have adapted to live in the burrows or homes of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which leaves it as the dominant neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise the child.
These couples may choose to plan adoptions for their children.
In an adoption, the birth parent terminates their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
Although it is not the only, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue periods of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was the monotonic genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments, labeling the proteins in phase with DNA or in phase with radioactive sulfur with radioactive phosphorus.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the pieces of genetic material affected and whether or not the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Mutations in germ-line cells only may be passed to offspring, while mutations elsewhere may cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplace and pass by other people whose work destination is the place they just left.
Each of these dynamic transport shuttles is connected in some way, and supports transport systems based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its highly stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone in society participates and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or was something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, the traffic stream has some reasonable consistency and can thus be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their upper wings back over the body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought they were correct but many believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
Why doesn't the Earth look like it's spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
20 percent of the water flowing into the ocean from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The New Kingdom Old Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors a thousand years older than all time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and one of the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, despite the fact that they can all be found in nature in native forms and are relatively simple to make with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
These four states of matter remained (in the same order) as solid, gas, and plasma, although they also theorized that they could and could not be converted into new matter.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. There are many elements in the periodic table of elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals such as silver and gold are.
You can also have metal alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements other than carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good companion for many people when out and about.
Sadly, as new methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been given less status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to go near a sharpener.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
Fusion bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy car down a hill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they decay very slowly and without a nucleus.
The surface of the Moon is composed of dust from rocks. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side is about 70 km thick and the far side is another 100 km thick.
It thins out under maria and thickens under highlands.
There may have been more maria nearby because the crust is thinner.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts people and what they do with the appeal.
This theory suggests that it is certain needs and desires some people have that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories looked at what it is about certain people that makes them want to do certain things and what things in their environment motivate them to do and not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hartzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, an outsider transforms into someone who feels they must change everything that makes them tick and make it their own.
Ultimately the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
These behaviors are often the result of a rift between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Her five characters have more autonomy than traditional team members because they can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by Oman's management.
The presence of a good ideal team (Larsen and LaFastow 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The ideal team is the management team to which each member reports.
One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources across the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Consequently, the response of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle may be a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) defines the catalyst approach as a method that is used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition. This therefore narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes we have never seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong sense of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, concerned with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that do not require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as have many home computers and video games built into software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides solutions with virtual field trips. Students can sit together in their classrooms to view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium and admire beautiful art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on one's trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most important audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also blogging &quot;forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.&quot; The need to feed the interest of the audience motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "empower students to be more analytical and critical; through actively reacting to Internet content, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oreveke, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive, bilingual capital city and features a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the far south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka and its beyond home to unspoiled natural beauty.
All of these things and more make Ontario perceived by outsiders as Canadian at its best.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and have few nearly uninhabited forests.
As for population comparisons that surprise everyone: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it became widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring will also help (not just the one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may have consequences for how they perceive harassment and that it is not unusual to be followed, held, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru el-Badya and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Along the old medina it will be easy to find places selling the full spectrum of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and gigos, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east of Rwanda.
Goma was devastated in 2002 by an eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which scorched the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is safe, any trip outside of Goma should be explored to understand the state of the fighting that remains in North Kivu province.
The city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
The normal (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs. You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
With its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" continued to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
These cities are in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as they have more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
Buying a wild card can be beneficial for anyone, providing entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is the location that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon Waterfront.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonialists settled, and as such is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However the forest is not just mangrove swamps - it includes some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq. km, of which about one-third consists of wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of travelling to nearby places like Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River to connect the town of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The twin towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The lower deck of the bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be finished.
The Guarani remain the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region remained home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who made their living by hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, the first of the so-called "Giant Provinces of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Fields in Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley from the FIC West store.
British pounds are commonly accepted anywhere in the islands and credit cards and United States dollars are also frequently accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards are rarely accepted on the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be; ask the owners in advance for the accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, as one must exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 ¬∞C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but air and moisture combine to make it feel colder than a thermometer.
There are no particular &quot;rainy&quot; and &quot;dry&quot; seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same all year.
Although many of the animals in the park will be used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, bears and wolves should be kept at a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] and all other wild animals at least 25 yards [25 m]!
No matter how docile they look, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost all larger animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't stay at the proper distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 the harbour was the site of an infamous naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 American and German men lost their lives.
During the war of independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lilofi III.
The most popular are in the three areas. The Auckland side of the two harbours have many beaches due to the incline.
The Northern Beaches are beaches (in the Northern Harbour District) on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of those protected areas are pristine beaches, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are Mission Bay in central Auckland and Waitemata Harbour in the upmarket suburb of St Helier.
It sometimes becomes a crowded family beach, with rows of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', a complex beer that is not green, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines fare better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're scared.
The idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. There is a small black 'espresso', cappuccinos come with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries to the reef from any of these causes are rare.
However, seek advice from authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found on beaches and along river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found swimming out of these burrows.
Sharks do exist, though they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is at the mouth of the North River from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that arrangements will be made to sleep in his berth once he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they may postpone your reservation for a while.
However any modifications or requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of people attending concerts decide to camp at the site, and most attenders consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music has ended on the main stages, there may still be parts of the celebration that have music playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic on a winter's day, check the cabin location, as there is quite a terrible noise from passing ice.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make several efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Window and clock guards are usually absent, and getting out may be difficult.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings in mind to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them on the premises.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served. However, drinking impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or hills should consider the possibility of snow or freezing temperatures.
Snowy and icy roads have less friction and you cannot drive as well as you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to leave you stranded.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or blowing or by condensation or snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and are a draw for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a subterranean journey to see stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "walking") involves long hikes, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from late March were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available on loan, even if one is not present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you prefer not to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat clothing (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, others require several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergies, spread toxins, or spread infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill humans, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in a single location.
Travelers bound for countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backwoods terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of yourself: steep grades, narrow streets and sharp turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those of the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are excellent and in Bavaria, similar to their southern neighbour, Austria, the menus are quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are baked into pastries year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want something small but rich in pastries, try Berliner, Pfaffenkuchen or Kraffen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;wet&quot; depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, curd is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
Again, if used without further qualifiers, the word originally meant food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine has a range of commonly experienced dishes, the predominant flavors being peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrup supports the rider's legs which hang from both ends of the saddle.
They provide more stability to the rider but may have safety concerns due to the possibility of their mind trapping the rider's legs.
If a rider is unseated from the horse, but has their feet caught in the stirrups they are at risk of being dragged if the horse turns the race bar. To reduce this risk, many safety precautions are taken.
First of all, most riders wear a single heel and a smooth, fairly narrow, shoe sole.
Next, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety straps that allow the leather of a stirrup to fall off the saddle when pulled back by the stirrup rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with large walls and crags of various types of granite.
The summit offers breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world constantly set new routes through the endless possibilities of its walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not include alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires very stiff skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than walking - but very rarely will you get the speed of cross country skiing without a heavy backpack on the finished track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control many times.
However, the Schengen Zone acts somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you are in these areas, you can usually cross the border without passing through passport control.
Likewise, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured items are antiques. The United States tax agencies define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
