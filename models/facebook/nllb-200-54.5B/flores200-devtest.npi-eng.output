This not only confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils generally cannot.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were light brown above and pale yellow or carotenoid below.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Although the rachis was not well-developed in dinosaur wings, researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than the barbs and barbules.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings, not chicken wings.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go to the booth alone, placing a pre-printed sheet of paper naming the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Candidates can send delegates to witness every aspect of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers following specific procedures under heavy surveillance.

Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years, while the PA agrees to a five-year military presence.
As the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated, the rangers had to closely observe the shooters in a supplemental pest control test.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that began in October.
At times, the failure to hold elections has sparked violent protests, some lasting as long as 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of malfunctioning iPods overheating were reported, with a total of six resulting in fires and four in common burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 extreme heat events, which the company described as "non-critical".
The ministry said it was "deeply regrettable" to postpone Apple's report.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday night).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
Philippine police have hijacked a bus in the capital, Manila, and are holding tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released as quickly as the Filipino photographers.
When the elderly woman needed the lavatory, photographers later took her place.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical field.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
Her research has shown that hormone treatment can accelerate the maturation of a baby's embryonic lungs.
Government investigators recovered two so-called "black boxes" of the flight recorders on Wednesday, Xinhua said.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of excess. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as eccentric as I was...maybe more so...love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Queen Elizabeth II is Australia's last monarch, a view shared by 34 percent of those polled.
In the overwhelming results of the referendum, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games but her fitness has been in doubt due to her complaints.
Due to the ban, he has not been able to take the necessary medication to relieve his pain.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of organic materials that can make proteins and support life on Earth, as well as water supplies.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed after the very first comets collided with Earth, especially how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumours as "political rubbish and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will help planes fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and cut carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track flights and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport has been put in place and underground trains will not stop at Wembley and car parking and park and ride facilities are not available at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation have increased the likelihood that the team will be forced to play behind closed doors without supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new bird species on the equatorial Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer due to breeding between the native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the exotic Sydow finch, Geospiza canirostris.
Gold can be cast into all sorts of shapes. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into the shape of a thin wire, which can be twisted and pounded. It can be hammered or rolled into a peg.
It can be made very thin and resistant to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "printed manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using the juice that turns red.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Separated from them by electrons (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron), hydrogen ions are protons.
Mix two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with wet, clean hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel nice and form a kind of covering.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities on Crete and in houses on Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathing houses where men and women mixed together.
When you make a call thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives the call and then reflects it back down immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is our much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars and many other modes of transport.
Many medium-sized cats fall under the category of medium-sized predators, ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are numerous small cats (including openly domesticated cats) that eat even more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of room, a special job each cat has to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of more than thirty females and cubs with one to three related adult males.
Women are often closely related to each other due to having large families of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions show characteristics similar to packs of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly lion-like in behavior (but not as much as big cats) and are very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not swim well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the force of a powerful human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of irritating, loud words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds.
Scientists think that ocelots locate animals for hunting by sniffing out where they live.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision, and can also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending into the surroundings of their prey and hovering over the prey.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) become separated from their main populations (such as if they move across a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they expose themselves to a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new mass community will require different features or adaptations than what was previously required to be strongly competitive.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe in and they take up the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants make photosynthesis from the sun to make their food. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
It had more than 70 sharp teeth, including an extra set of incisors and canines, attached to the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It attacks anything that enters the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex couldn't.
Although their diet was similar to ours, the Romans ate strange or exotic creatures, including wild pigs, peacocks, porcupines, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, rich men preferred to have banquets together where they could rest by their side after eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine does not include foods imported from Europe to the Americas or Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was viewed as a god's house.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Special pyramid-shaped columns sometimes called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
(Deuteronomy 6:6, 7) The Israelites were commanded: "You must not eat from every tree of the garden".
Women cooked in the courtyards; shops were the only open counters overlooking the city.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce, and wood was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, travelling further west, found Greenland and named it Grønland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knew who wrote it, it is known that early in its life a large vellum document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was brought in for storage.
Therefore, it is possible to add a signal as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the south was still not free.
This "Vichy" was ruled by the French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked together instead of fighting the invaders.
"Operation Dragoon" was the code name for the Allied invasion of southern France on August 15, 1940.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and marched into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by significantly larger groups who live and work cooperatively in societies.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which to some extent also defines the shape of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the forwarding of knowledge over many generations, a delayed cultural footprint, and a fair spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Since Congress had no power to levy taxes and had no national executive and judiciary, it depended on often uncooperative state officials to carry out its functions.
It also had no power to violate tax laws and tariffs between states.
Unanimous consent of all the states was required before amending those articles and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The second most successful teams in the world are the Italy national football team and the German national football team and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Famous sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's exploration began in the 15th century when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes to indigenous grain production practices and beginning to employ Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded ownership of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, including Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Many of the buildings around the complex have been restored to give visitors a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of the fishery had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the dominant film size photography format at the end of the analog film era was 35mm, the most common still image in the world.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proportions are made by the sensor pattern of the digital camera image.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat misleadingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of this pattern (by dividing twelve to get the ratio of the simplest whole number) is therefore 3:2.
Most common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are equal to or approximately close to this size ratio.
The much-abused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining order in the created image.
It states that the most efficient location for the main object is at the intersection of lines that divide the figure into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For thousands of years, despite differences in language and culture, Christianity held the European states together.
Its omnipotence affects everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church coffers exist specifically for this reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the Church had been in Rome, and the concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
As hostilities escalated, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
By cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international laws written by various international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective
Britain built tunnels in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, thus endangering even neutral ships.
Having had limited response to its tactics, the German expected a similar response in its restricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Because of the horrors of World War I and the events leading up to it, the nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such warfare.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 pennies to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had different ways of representing different time periods; each phase or family in power in China had a distinct dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between each dynasty. Among these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles raged between various nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody era in ancient Chinese history in which thousands of people died fighting for supremacy in the Great Court of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs not only to the ruler but also to the people.
Even after the revolution, the profession was open to all male applicants, the most ambitious and successful.
The same was happening in the army because although the ranks of the army were based on class, they were recently based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in what lay beyond this earthly life. He frequently used the cave known as "Hira" in the mountains of "Noor" (Light) for meditation.
The saying that he who conquered death built himself a cave provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knew it existed, it would be extremely difficult to find.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains surrounding it.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which The Great Pyramid is the largest), many smaller tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" mark looks like a V and the "down bow" mark looks like an unfolded staple or square.
Top means you have to start at the tip and push the bow and bottom means you have to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow generally produces a softer sound while a down-bow is stronger and more vertical.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember that printed bow marks are for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789 a crowd of market women forced the terrified King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to leave Versailles for Paris.
In a car surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and chanting threats against the King and Queen, they returned to Paris.
The crowd forced the windows of the King and Queen's carriages to be left open.
At one point, a member of the crowd even shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of U.S. imperialism's war in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government to repay a major part of the expenses and interest on the bonds.
In fact, the superprofits generated from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic advantage of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the order.
The era in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages began before the Early Middle Ages and then began after the Late Middle Ages, traditionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-induced or technological imperative in a strict sense to human destiny driven by the underlying logic associated with the scientific laws that govern technology and their manifestation.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share these two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence and that as a result technology "influences" underlying societies rather than being socially adaptive.
For example, one could say that the motor car is leading the way in the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new methods of production have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also causes a high incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new ways in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Sanskritism, geography inclined individuals and over time geography-related customs and culture arose and these were superior to arbitrarily applied laws, while maintaining harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century as the Crusaders returned gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
This was at a time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the East, dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because communication channels lag, styles in the West can lag 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the most important developments that people made as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the practice of farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using ecologically sound saved native seeds along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people to feel excluded from a social level and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through specific and symbolic uses of style, including mannerisms, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to note some unfortunate cases of children who faced neglect, misfortune, or voluntary abuse because they were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "unruly" or feral. Some unruly children are confined by people (usually their own parents). In some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Rude children may have suffered serious child abuse or physical harm before leaving home and running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to inhabit the forests themselves.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child's behavior (within physiological limits) is often entirely directed at special care animals such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, which takes scaffolding one step further.
Scaffolding is an aid rather than a method of learning that provides support to people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as at the start of a new computer program or a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffold but also a small paper person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized into the software and are intended to question, simulate and explain processes that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and involvement in robberies.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without nurturing, caring and teaching, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care should be provided by our parenting system.
It is felt that foster care should provide for all those needs that were not previously available in their homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet will bring additional aspects in terms of usage and satisfaction approaches.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording in the interpretation of microexpressions has led to important discoveries that facial movements last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to make accurate assessments with reality.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation, latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Disconnection and recombination reverses the change before and after with each generation between the two bridges.
Outside the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans has difficulty meeting its amino-acid needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased mental distress, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The proteins found in leaves and fruits may be the easiest and most accessible vegetable sources, but for us Narwhals, these foods are difficult to digest raw.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, yeast, eggs) are not only easily digestible as they contain all the essential amino acids but they also provide a high amount of protein.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep intervention is the process of purposefully waking you during your normal sleep period and putting you to sleep after a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
This quiet alarm clock can easily be used to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, known to induce urination) before bed, which forces the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positive life is, and the more each individual has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana texts of love and the many ways of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga asanas, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visibility of various deities energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy of both countries in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the country collapsed due to clashes of systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the war ended, former friends became enemies, and the Cold War began.
From Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, it would remain for the next 40 years, fighting through proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, Polish immunity had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and rebuild the Romanian front.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern regions in bilateral and multilateral violations of the Riga Peace Treaty, Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaties, and other international treaties, creating the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts.
Using ships to transport goods is the best way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and your goods and at the same time interfere with the enemy's ability to move your enemy and his goods in the traditional way.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were seeking to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly through the use of U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in groups which were moved around the mountains or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders many of whom are children or adolescents, similar to what is widely known as herding. These methods of herding in groups are still used today.
The wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways only had parallel flaps, they allowed horses to gain more speed to pull and to pull larger loads than roads that were slightly deteriorated during the day.
Cross ties to hold the rails were introduced very early. Gradually, however, it was realized that it would be more efficient if the rails had iron stipes on them.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the vehicles.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rods were introduced.
The first known transport was walking, humans began walking upright about two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not naturally walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future generations to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want only temporary solutions, we have to find the root of the problems and we have to neutralize them.
The world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances. Clearly, increased population and mankind's extraordinary life-style have increased the problems.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten record, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlop's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
25 The Dunlap broadsides are the oldest known surviving copies of a document. No original manuscript copy has survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs lived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Because they have wings and can fly, most people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
There's still a lot of talk about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have claws and claws on their feet, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in use are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
An even digit can have only one of two values, such as 00 or 11, and these digits are called even digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity is not immediately apparent.Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite common and may not be immediately diagnosed.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicine or the presence of toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
The term bug is used in a formal sense for a group of kits.
The term derives from an ancient acquaintance with udus, which are highly adapted to being parasitic on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed-bugs adapted to live in nests or the accommodation of their hosts are avoided.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that child-rearing may not be in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make a foster care plan for their child.
In adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that the adoptive couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although it does not stand alone, testing (a test is an investigation used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), by asking questions and observing, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all matters of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself moving away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms about physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of circadian cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for many living organisms, including microbes, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a free-running cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were pioneering suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hersey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of different types of mutations depend on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and if the affected cells are germline (lineage cells).
Other mutations can cause cell death or cancer, so the mutation in the germ line cells can be passed on to the child.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the environment.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transportation shuttle is somehow connected to and supportive of the private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from its steady state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are only transportation engineers incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably uniformly; thus, traffic streams have some practical consistency and may be poorly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of trail facilities.
The first animals to take to the air were insects. Their ability to fly has helped them to get rid of enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings back into the body.
This gives them small, wide-ranging places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the twirling dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought it was true that the earth orbits the sun, but many people believe otherwise.
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The second longest and largest river on Earth is the Amazon. It carries 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that reaches the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of construction, the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom.
The ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest independent state and one of the most sparsely populated.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, but Italian is also the everyday language of many who work in the government.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found naturally in nature and can be mined relatively easily with basic tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all matter is composed of one or a combination of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Alloy metals are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
All matter in the universe is made of matter. Everything is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, as soon as Sisakulam came out, it became a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, along with the appearance of new methods of writing has come the decline in the low status and uses of the siccalum.
People now type messages on computer screens, never coming near a sharpener.
When something new comes along, one can only wonder what the keyboard will become.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy-tonnage car driving up a hill, some of that energy is released when the nucleus splits again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and this causes them to break apart with little or no shock.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outer surface of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick near the surface and 100 kilometers thick farther out.
It is thin below the maria and thick below the highlands.
The near side may be more maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding situations that people can choose from or that appeal to them.
These theories suggest that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do certain things and look at certain things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular material theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum seeks to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is the morph of the unknown in which Neij realizes that he must change everything the team is doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior creates a rift between most leaders and the rest.
Virtual teams are considered to have similar levels of excellence to traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? The goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, an organization's process working together to remove a barrier can lead to a new state-of-the-art process to meet customer needs.
Before new change can happen in an organization, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the continuum approach as a methodology used to help an organization reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition, thereby narrowing the research field and making it more precise.
Interactions between brain pathology and behavior help scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, wounds, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and materials to build stimulus models that help us understand our brain processes.
Although AI has a strong sense of science fiction, AI constitutes an important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, diagnose customers and answer questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
It's different because it's focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as being built into various home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often teachers like to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers solutions with virtual field trips.Students can sit in their classrooms to view museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or admire beautiful art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina each year design a website about their visit to the state capitol, each year the website is rebuilt, but older versions are kept online to be used as scrapbooks.
When a student starts his blog with poor grammar and spelling, it is usually changed by the presence of the audience.
Since students are often the most important audience, bloggers tend to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to pique an audience's interest motivates students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their education beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "empowers students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writing as well as outline their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features an array of museums and a collection of art galleries showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls in the distance and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider the most upscale Canadian province.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising demographic comparison: There are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands lie off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
For wildlife, Madagascar is the largest and a continent in itself.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land and it spread extensively in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female passengers should say they are married regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not just an expensive looking ring).
As a result of cultural differences, it is not uncommon for women to understand and follow what they think about harassment, including holding hands.
Be determined to show men that you're weak and don't be afraid to stand your ground (it's not okay if there aren't cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and only rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca to avoid being lost after the earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar el-Bada'a, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
One of the least interesting places to shop is Casablanca in Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, utensils, leather goods, the whole spectrum of hookahs and gigs but this is all for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should include research to understand the conflict situation in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla tracking as well as climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance ride.
Combined with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poorly built city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonder of the African World.
The city is quite different from other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African roots.
Bordering Mozambique to the east, Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. To the north is Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park occupies 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecoregions, each of which supports distinct wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is also considered as one of the major attractions of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like South African national parks, daily conservation and entrance fees are charged for the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a wild card that grants admission to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all national parks there.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
The exhibition of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is celebrated in bright columns that are made clear by the presence of the water in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head opposite the Kowloon Waterfront.
The north bank of land reclaimed for much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed.
Britain colonized the area and it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt stretching 80 km (50 mi) along the Bangladeshi and Indian coastlines.
The Sundarbans has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just evergreen swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the immense forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by water and swamp areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and the area is now estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (towards the river) throughout the day, although most of the time they leave between 06:30 and 07:30 heading east/Boomthang.
It is advisable to book tickets a few days in advance as inter-district buses are often full.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Pekaha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River between the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, and the town of Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and its two lanes are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay were the Guaraní, who lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes and other groups such as the Guaycurí and the Payaguí, who made their living from hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with indigenous tribal groups.
The Spanish began a colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous worldwide as a country with good polo teams and players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
At other times of the year, smaller competitions and games can also be seen here.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), with a value set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the Banks on the Islands located at FIC West Store in Stanley.
British pounds are accepted on most islands, and Stan's credit cards and United States dollars are accepted.
Although British and U.S. currency are accepted, credit cards may not be accepted in the outer islands; talk to the owner in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
As it is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be bitterly cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of air and humidity makes it feel colder than a thermometer.
There are no particular "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals should not be fed or frightened.
Park officials say to stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
Bison, elk, moose, bear, and just about any large animal can make a seemingly harmless attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year when they don't keep their distance.Because these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, give them your space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep campgrounds clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All ships but one British cruiser were sunk. About 200 American and German men were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of Chief Tupua Tamasese Leopold III.
Due to the spread of Auckland's two harbours there are many beaches. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Bank beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy sea banks in which it is safe to swim and often shaded by pohutukawa trees.
There are sea beaches on Tamaki Drive in Waitemata Harbour, Mission Bay in the Central Market and St Heliers in the Central Auckland Market.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a nice chain of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", not a complicated beer, but fun and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines are available here, but it may be better to go with wines from New Zealand and Australia.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're scared.
The idea of a "plain white" coffee is foreign to Australians. It is a short black "espresso", cappuccino topped with cream (not unlike a fizz) and tea served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the rock are made throughout the year and injuries to the rock from any of these causes are rare.
Still, get advice from authorities, follow all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the coast and near river mouths from October to April. They can sometimes be found outdoors during these times.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being at river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents usually contract with certain hotels.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or a combination of flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) needed for your destination, they may already have a reservation for you.
Any modifications that need to be made during the trip should be made directly with the travel agent rather than the hotel.
For some festivals, many attendees of music festivals decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
It should be noted that there may be parts of the festival that continue music into the evening, even after the main stages have ended.
Some festivals have special camping areas for young children with small families.
If crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as it closes with a very alarming noise for the most affected people as the ice gets in the way.
St. Petersburg cruises included time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Many casinos try to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are often left up and it can be difficult to get out.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment acts to keep guests in a good mood and keep them at a premium.
However, drunkenness interferes with justice, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
If driving in high latitude or mountainous areas, one should consider the possibility of snow, ice or icy temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, friction is reduced and you can't drive as well as you can on bare dirt.
During a blizzard, you can get stuck in a lot of snow in a very short time.
Visibility may be restricted by falling or blowing snow or by thick steam or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries and cause traffic disruptions throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the word safari refers to a journey overland to view the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, prefer to get close to cars and level equipment will give a better view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will get a better look at them through binoculars.
(also called "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "going on foot") involves a walking safari of several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Olympics in 1964, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a difficult time.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the latest March when the Olympics were scheduled, cancellation policies based on coronavirus do not extend into July 2020.
It is expected that tickets for most events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, compared to ¥7,000 for ordinary tickets.
Ironing cold clothes helps dry them. Ironing and ironing boards are available for rent in many hotels even if the room does not have one.
If an iron is not available or you do not wear your ironed socks properly, you can use a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to make clothing too hot (which can shrink or burn in extreme conditions).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas one minute is enough to boil water, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness and should you be interested, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not always called parasites.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in some places.
Travelers bound for many heavily taxed countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont often presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway through remote forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep discretion about yours which have steep grades, narrow routes and sharp curves.
The speed limits issued on the front and rear sections appear to be low - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than otherwise.
However, compared to other places along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds, mobile phone coverage is quite good.
German pastries are good and in Bavaria, like their southern neighbour Austria, there are many fillings and varieties.
Fruit based pastries are commonly available, with apple based pastries being made throughout the year and cherry and plum based pastries being used in the summer.
Peanuts, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are added to many German baked goods. Popular cakes are typically paired with a strong cup of coffee.
If you prefer smaller pastries, look for Berliner, Fafenkuchen or Kraffen, depending on the region.
A vegetarian diet is a diet based on herbs and spices that includes meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of broth, the vegetable may be "dry" or "dried".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in vegetables; coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella that encompasses a variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
The word originally referred to the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes dishes commonly used spices, the main flavors favored by Javanese are almonds, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Recabs are supports for the rider's legs, which hang down either side of the cushion.
They provide a great deal of stability for the rider but there may be safety concerns due to the potential for the rider's feet to become trapped in them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but the legs are caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them while running. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
Initially, most riders were wearing heels and boots with soft, very narrow soles.
Now, some cushions, especially British cushions, have safety strips that pull a recumbent skin down from the cushion if the struggling rider pulls back.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America with its variety of large granite walls and steep cliffs.
Reaching Chuli involves breathtaking views from the summit. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between its endless potential walls.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular downhill snow sports involving skiing or snowboarding down a snow-covered area on foot.
Skiing is a major travel activity for enthusiasts who plan to ski at a fixed location for the entire day of their vacation and are known as "sky bombers".
The wearing of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers have been found as far back as 5000 BC.
The sport of downhill skiing has been played since at least the 17th century, and the first ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is usually associated with alpine style ski touring or mountaineering even if it does not involve mountaineering. Backcountry in steep terrain and requires very strong skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly more distance than walking, but only very rarely will you be able to achieve the speed of cross country skiing on prepared tracks without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is small overall but has many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means applying for visas and going through passport control many times.
To some extent, the Schengen Area functions as a country in this respect.
As long as you live in the area, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, once you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for visas for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define objects older than 110000 years as antiques.
Depending on the geographical region, this definition has different meanings, and the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antique items, although they are later than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the business is also important to many other businesses.
Even traditionally, though, not all Sami have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding business, but survived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, with reindeer often as working animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although it has been particularly widely used among non-Romanies, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Warning announcements are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The approaches presented are often incomplete, general, and oversimplified compared to the extensive information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather event capable of causing damage, severe social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and has different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rain, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, such as hurricanes, typhoons, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, ice storms, hailstorms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be alert to any risk of severe weather in their area as these may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
