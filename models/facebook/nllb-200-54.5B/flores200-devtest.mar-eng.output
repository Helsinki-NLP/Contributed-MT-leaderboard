Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory that's already widespread, but it also tells us details that we can't usually get from fossils, like color and 3-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown on the top and light brown on the inside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers did not develop a rod called a saw, but they did have other features of feathers - counts and contromasks - leading scientists to speculate that saws were more likely to have evolved as the next stage in genetic evolution than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for fighting but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen indicates that it is an adult feather and not a juvenile.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The group was looking to study the effects of tidal forces between dark matter in the Milky Way and dark matter between galaxies.
Just as the gravitational attraction between the Moon and the Earth creates tides, the gravitational attraction between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius Galaxy creates tides.
Scientists were able to demonstrate that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that the darkest matter around galaxies is located in a luminous cavity around the galaxy and is composed of countless small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience; voters isolate themselves at a polling station, place a pre-printed piece of paper with their preferred candidate's name in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes will be placed in them except for properly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under tight security, following the prescribed procedure.

While this is common practice elsewhere in the UK, Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that ""if journalists publish a photo of a suspect etc, it's like walking a dangerous line".""
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the proceedings, has informed reporters that it will not comment until further charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians want based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other issues involved reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel has demanded that the current military base in the valley be maintained for 10 years, while the PA has agreed that it should be maintained for only 5 years.
The shooter in the Assisted Pest Control trial was closely monitored by the ranger while the test was being observed and evaluated for usefulness.
In partnership with NPWS and Sporting Shooter Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooter Association's hunting programme.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn into the new 9-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission had recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards fresh elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes-violent protests are triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
A total of 60 iPod malfunctions and overheating were reported, including six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called ""non-serious""".
"The ministry has reacted to Apple's postponement of the report as ""really regrettable""".
The earthquake struck La Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday night).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reported no damage anywhere in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has hijacked a bus of Hong Kong tourists and taken them hostage in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far and at least 6 deaths have been reported.
Forty-six people, including children and the elderly, were released as quickly as the Filipino photographer.
The elderly woman had to go to the bathroom, so the photographer took her place.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
His research has shown that if the hormone is given, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that two 'black boxes' flight recorders were seized by government investigators on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the queen of amazing. She was my first manager.
"Dustin ""Goldie"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was as weird as I was...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll miss her...hope she's in a better place".""
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she wanted Australia to become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and 3 relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints raised questions about his fitness.
Due to the ban from the sport, he could not take medication to overcome his pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the authenticity of the discovery using different hardware and software since early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets are likely to be sources that deliver water to Earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, when a comet struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "futile political chatter and nonsense".
It was speculated that he would try for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite based technology as opposed to earlier ground based radar based technology to provide more precise guidance to air traffic controllers, aircraft and more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is being provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley and car parking, park-and-ride facilities will not be available at the ground.
The fear of inadequate communication has increased the likelihood of sports teams being forced to play behind closed doors without supporters.
An observation on the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands was published in the journal Science on Thursday.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two weeks, although breeding between the native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, suggests the process may have taken longer.
Gold can be molded into any shape. It can be rolled into small pieces.
It can be drawn into thin wires, which can be rolled into sheets. The metal can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very small and embedded in other metals. It could be made so small that it was used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "ornamented manuscripts".
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical is indicated by the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (just like hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Swirl 2 dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a funny feeling and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space are contacted and responded to almost instantly.
This satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of the light and images we want.
Launching a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
This gave us railways, cars and many other modes of transport.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is this concept of niche, that each cat has a special task that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride is composed of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually very closely related to each other, with sisters and daughters forming a large family.
Groups of lions often behave like packs of animals with a striking resemblance to their behaviour to that of hyenas and dogs (but not other big cats) and are extremely lethal to their predators.
A fully trained tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same species (species Panthera) as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar.
A tiger's roar is not the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a series of flashing, roaring words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds.
Scientists think that ocelots hunt animals for food, chasing and detecting them by their sense of smell to see where they are on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark at night and can easily sneak around. Ocelots blend into their surroundings and hunt their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original population, (such as when they migrate across a mountain range or river or move to a new island where they cannot easily move back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than previously required to become strong competitors.
There has been no change in the native population, they still need to adapt.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less like other populations.
After all, even after thousands or millions of years, two populations look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans use to breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to make our homes and clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw was lined with over 70 sharp teeth, with an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anyone who got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Much of their food may be familiar to you, but the Romans feasted on strange and unusual foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called the dormouse.
Another difference was that rich people preferred to eat together, where they could enjoy their meals in comfort, while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs.
The ancient Roman diet could not have included the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa powder, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they viewed as the house of the god.
The people brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' requirements through festivals and ceremonies.
Each shrine has an open shrine courtyard and only the priest can enter the inner sanctum.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of these temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not very important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shop counters were open to the street; stones were used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland became sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and after traveling a little further west, he found Greenland, and it was named Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living in the area at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different peoples, kings, traditions, and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776"". This text appears at the bottom of this document, in the opposite direction".
No one knows who wrote it, but it is known that in his early life, large parchment documents (29 3/4 inches to 24 1/2 inches in size) were brought in for storage.
So, it could be that this notation is just a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent wars brought freedom to the north of France, but not yet to the south.
"It was ruled by the ""Vichy"" French, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight them".
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called ""Operation Dragoon""".
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large community of people living and working together in society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin citio, meaning citizen, related to the Latin città, meaning citizen, and civile, meaning city or city-state, and they also define the extent of a society to some extent.
City-states were the precursors of states. A civilized civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lingering cultural footprint, and appropriate allocation.
Small cultures often disappear without relevant historical evidence and fall short of being recognized as proper cultures.
As the Revolutionary War progressed, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - only Congress was a significant part of it - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since it had no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state officials, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
It did not have the power to override the tax laws between states.
Before the amendment of this Act, the unanimous consent of all the States was required and the Central Government was not taken seriously by all the States, its representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region where Italians compete in international games and the Olympics.
Japan is a group of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
"Japan is often referred to as an ""archipelago"" from a geographical point of view, as it consists of groups of islands".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, modified the tribes' grain production practices, and employed Chinese laborers to cultivate rice and sugar on it.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing regime signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded its claim to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of 3 main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed so that tourists can get a better idea of what the earlier buildings would have looked like in their original form.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size of the late analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but importantly its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a bit confusing.
The format is assumed to have an aspect ratio of 3:2 (dividing by 12 to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio).
Many common formats (e.g., APS family formats) are the same or close to this aspect ratio.
The extremely-strict and often-ridiculous rule of thirds are simple guidelines that create dynamism when keeping sequence measurements in a photograph.
It states that the most effective place for the main thing is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under attack.
For thousands of years, Christianity held Europe together, despite differences in language and culture.
His omnipotence impressed everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are used for exactly that purpose.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the Church was in Rome, and this centralization of power and money led many to question whether the doctrine even existed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international laws codified by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy was effective in cutting off significant military and civilian supplies.
Britain built a tunnel in international waters (a part of the ocean not claimed by any country) to cut off access to an entire section of the ocean.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of peace and neutrality.
After witnessing the atrocities and horrors of World War I, all nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He returned to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, his manager at his previous job.
Ancient China had an unusual way of representing time; each period or ruling family of China was associated with a specific dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of fragmented provinces between each dynasty. The best known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce wars between many royal people fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the battle for the supreme throne in the Great Wall of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, many business opportunities were available to these male applicants, allowing the most talented and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the Army as seniority in the Army will be based on proficiency instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many exploited working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in the things beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave on the mountain ""Noor"" (Light) known as ""Hira"" for knowledge".
He lived longer in the cave, which provided a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a mountain range north of Mecca, it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if someone knows it's there, it's not easy to find because once you're inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
Only a small part of this world can be seen or heard from the depths of the cave, except for the surrounding mountains and the clear and beautiful sky above.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is 1 of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and The Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and shrines were built to honor Khufu's sons and family members.
The "up arrow" mark looks like a V, and the "down arrow mark" looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
At the top, you start at the tip and move the bow forward, and at the bottom, you start at the frog, where you're holding the bow in your hand, and pull the bow.
The up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while the down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Use separate pencils to manipulate your own signs, but remember that printed bow signs are for musical purposes, so they usually need to be emphasized.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on 6 October 1789.
In the carriage, they traveled back to Paris amid a throng of people shouting and screaming dangerously against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their car.
At one point, a member of the crowd struck a Versailles palace guard and bounced his head in front of the terrified queen.
It was the Filipino people who paid the price for the US imperialist conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US imperial system to cover a large part of the costs and interest on the bonds issued by the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the great benefits to be derived from the long-term subjugation of the Filipino people will be fundamental benefits to US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events take place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages: the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) of European history.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from the technology-push or technological perspective in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental reasoning related to scientific laws and the expression of technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that in turn technology has ""effects"" on societies that are, rather than social outcomes, immanent".
For example, we might say that the motor car made possible the development of roads.
However, the countrywide network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so many new methods of manufacturing have been developed to reduce the cost of cars.
High car ownership also leads to high road accidents, requiring new technologies in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
It was proposed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel that cultural determinism was a major factor in Romanticism.
In terms of taste, geography shaped humans, and over time, customs and cultures associated with the region and consistent with this society were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of federal Europe in the same way that Paris is regarded as the fashion capital of the world today.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the return of gifts such as silks and spices accepted by the Crusaders that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the time when the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century.
Early Eastern Byzantine culture heavily influenced clothing.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, the Western style may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own styles, and as a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of the period was the use of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done only to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family and to produce enough food.
Compulsory farming is a simple, often organic, system in which native, preserved seeds are used in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase production.
Historically, many farmers used agriculture as a means of livelihood and this is still the case in many developing countries.
A subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary by age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of members.
The distinguishing characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture indicate their membership in diverse and symbolic ways, including fashion, customs, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to tell some unfortunate stories of young children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
"Such children are called ""wild"" or feral. Some feral children have been captured by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases they have been abandoned due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Child predators are likely to experience a significant amount of child abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild of their own free will.
The behaviour (within physiological limits) of a child raised by animals other than humans appears similar to that of this particular animal caring for him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While experience-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, plagiarism goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool to help people who are going through a new learning experience, such as a computer program or starting a new project.
Mentors can be both virtual and real, in other words, the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is a mentor, just like a teacher.
The virtual scaffolds are internalised in the software and are designed to illustrate the process of asking questions, being prepared and challenging the student to solve alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there's no nurturing, no care and no education, but they do.
We know that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the essentials that are lacking in the previously taken home.
The Internet combines both collective and interconnected elements.
Different properties of the Internet lead to further directions such as usage and satisfaction approaches.
For example, 'eLearning' and 'socialisation' have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Agme and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous connection"" as new motivators when investigating audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of subtle facial expressions lasting up to a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by accurately analyzing subtle gestures, a person can tell if someone is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The Presidential Speech", says that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He also suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be present in animals such as pet dogs.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are 2 groups/pulls of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations produce new genetic changes, and selection separates them from the pool of known changes.
Isolation and recombination alternate back and forth between the two bridges with each generation.
In the savannah, amino-acid requirements from available plant sources are difficult to meet for those with digestive systems like humans.
Furthermore, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources are the proteins in the leaves and seeds, but they are difficult for us humans to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, carnivorous foods (ants, lizards, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also a rich source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" like modern savanna chimpanzees".
Sleep disruption is the deliberate process of waking up during normal sleep and returning to sleep after a period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock without waking you up completely.
If you think you're resetting your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (mainly water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, which may require a person to get up to urinate.
The degree to which a person's inner peace is conflicted determines the degree of stress in one's body and mind.
The less stress there is, the more positive life energy there is and each individual has the potential to achieve complete peace and contentment.
Knowledge is within everyone's reach, but our own stress and negativity is the only thing standing in the way.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha but incorporates the Mahayana path of love and many of the techniques of Indian Yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's Kundalini yoga, it's meditation and it's the path to love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is Deva Yoga. Through the vision of various deities, the energy channels are sanctified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
The USSR and the USA became allies in World War II because Germany was a common enemy. By the end of the war, they were separated by systemic, methodological and cultural differences.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This was to last for the next 40 years as proxy armies from Africa to Asia fought for real on the battlefields of Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed and the only hope now was to retreat and regroup near the Romanian bridgehead.
However, violations of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact as well as other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, rendered these plans obsolete almost overnight when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered Poland's eastern territories after invading and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts.
The use of ships is the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods through the oceans.
A fleet's traditional role is to maintain its country's ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with its enemy's ability to move people and goods.
A notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII, when the Americans were trying to move men and supplies to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for milk, hair, meat, and skins as readily available.
Domestic goats roam the hills or other pastures where they are usually kept in a herd, often under the supervision of young or adolescent boys and a shepherd with some knowledge.
In England, wagonways were built in the early 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the use of horses to gain good speed and pull heavier loads on the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced very early to hold the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that they would be more efficient if the tracks had an iron level.
This became a common practice, but the iron increased wear on the wooden wheels of the coach.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, fully iron locomotives were introduced.
Walking was the earliest known form of transport, with humans walking upright around 200,000 years ago with the rise of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not always walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Saelanthropus may have been walking on 2 legs by about 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more friendly way with nature, we can join the nature movement and we can also become activists to reduce the suffering of future generations.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the progress of mankind in science and technology and the problems due to the increased population and the hectic lifestyle of mankind have increased.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlop's print shop a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as the ""Dunlap Broadside""".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
1 was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document known to still exist. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of it as a dinosaur because it has wings and it can fly.
But a lot of what you find in birds still looks like dinosaurs.
They have feet with hooves and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like T. rex.
All computers currently in use are based on the use of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
An open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals can be the best sign of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with flies, which are insects that are extremely dependent on humans.
Both killer bugs and ladybugs are sedentary, adapting to living in nests or in the homes of hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States of America making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
Couples may decide that it may not be in their best interests or the best interests of their child to have custody.
These couples may decide to plan for the adoption of their child.
In adoption, the birth parents of a child relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take custody of that child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which guides the vast majority of real scientific research.
However, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate the possibility of 1 or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and recording observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical literature and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge spread, the West realized that it had been cut off from its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms seen in physiology and behavior are critically dependent on internal cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Not only do they respond to external periodic signals, but periodic rhythms have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue cycling freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they either marked the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the region of genetic material to which it has occurred, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells or not.
In children, only new cells can be changed, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature based tourism attracts people who wish to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural scenery including flora and fauna wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting Borneo, taking photographs and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small country villages to go to their workplace and are passed by other people, whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supporting the personal car based transport system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has altered the steady state of ecosystems that have supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems provoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it only transportation engineers who are inefficient?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between 2 points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is fairly consistent; therefore, the flow of traffic is fairly continuous and can usually be represented mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, the following 3 main characteristics are related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of keeping their wings close to their bodies.
This gives it a large range of small spaces to defend itself from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought otherwise; that the sun (and other stars as well) revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the Earth's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects the waters of thousands of smaller rivers.
Construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the size of the Giza pyramids and the superior technical quality of their construction were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom focused on the monuments of their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the world's smallest independent country and the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislative and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four basic elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This is very similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they could be converted into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of certain types of matter, and all certain types of matter are made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them can fit into a small volume.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the importance and use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, never having to use a sharpener.
A person may also wonder how a new word will be typed on the keyboard when it comes.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy car up a hill, splitting the nucleus up again, releasing some of the energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, meaning they are likely to explode with little or no shock.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thin near the maria and thick in the highlands.
Because the hard outer layer is thin, there may be more maria nearby, making it easier for the larvae to crawl to the surface.
Intent theories focus on finding out why people make choices or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
It's a theory that looks at how people tend to do the things they want to do and the things in their environment that allow them to do those things and the things that don't.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally, when managers start managing their former colleagues, 2 types of behavior may emerge. People at one end of the spectrum tend to be ""one of the boys"" (or girls)".
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, evaluate performance, assign responsibility, and hold people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one becomes unrecognizable to the person who wants to change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often serves to drive a wedge between the hero and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more autonomy than members in a traditional team because their local management may not understand that their team can meet across different time zones.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larsen and LaFastow, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would anyone want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an institute of learning?
Creativity and innovation can be seen when all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of the organization.
As a result, the organization's process of working together to remove barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and institutional learning.
Agle (2006) reports that organizations use the Continuum Approach as a method to achieve this highest performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive inquiry, thereby reducing the search barrier and making it more accurate.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and its behavior helps scientists in their search.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and even alter some mental functions.
New technologies are emerging that allow us to see and probe structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our own minds.
Although AI has a science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves building machines that can automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnostics and the ability to answer questions as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in many fields, including economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is built into many home computer and video game software deployments.
Physical visits are a huge part of classroom learning, and often a teacher has to take her students to places where the bus option is not available.
Technology has provided a solution for virtual field trips where students can see art objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art in their classrooms.
Virtualizing a field trip is also a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned but older versions are kept online as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students often encounter incorrect grammar and spelling in blogs, the presence of a listener often changes this.
Now, since students are the harshest critics, bloggers strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also ""makes students more aware of the world around them"." The need to feed them according to the audience's interests motivates children to be more intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
"Proper use of blogs ""helps children become more analytical and therapeutic; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can place themselves in the context of others' writing as well as form their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravek, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's very attractive, bilingual capital and home to many unique art exhibitions and museums that tell the story of Canada's past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is Muskoka and the home of undiscovered natural beauty beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario being considered the best Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, the population is very sparse and parts of it are part of uninhabited forest.
For a population comparison that might surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
These East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or allies with France, and are called luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the land and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama navigated the Cape route from Europe to India.
It is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who is travelling should state that she is married irrespective of her actual marital status.
Wearing a ring (any ring, not just one that looks expensive) is also helpful.
Women need to understand that what they perceive as harassment may be due to cultural differences and that chasing, holding hands, etc. are not uncommon.
Be firm about rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was settled by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be left empty after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-i-Bada, and the Spanish traders who established their trading post there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items such as tagines (North American stews), pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a treasure trove of numerous decorative items, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, bordering Rwanda at its eastern end.
In 2002, ash from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, destroying most of the city's roads, especially in the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The town is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese Francs.
"With its remoteness, ""Timbuktu"" is used as an example of a unique and distant place".
Today, Timbuktu is a city that has lost its prosperity, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This was 1 of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is quite different from other cities in the country, as the people here are more like Arabs than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a major landmark of the South African National Parks (SANPs).
Like other South African national parks, the park charges a daily conservation and entrance fee.
It may also be beneficial to purchase 1 Wild Card which gives access to select parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
The Hong Kong Island gives its name to the surrounding area and is the main reason for many tourists to visit Hong Kong.
The view of Hong Kong's skyscrapers highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour is compared to a glowing bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side of Kowloon Falls.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is crowded onto the redeveloped land on the north shore.
The site was claimed by British colonists, and so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest seagrass belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the remote interior of India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Indian part of the forest is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just salt marshes however - they include some remnants of the many forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The inter-district bus station (across the river) is served by several buses throughout the day, although most depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially in the direction of Puno and Jakarta/Bumthang.
Inter-district buses from here to Bardhaman are fully booked, so it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable option to visit nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Puneakha (No. 200).
The Bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River basin connecting the cities of Oyapock, Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The 2 towers are 83 meters high, this one is 378 meters high and has 2 streets 3.50 meters wide.
The overhead clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be finished.
The Guarania were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were nomadic hunters who also farmed for a living.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurí and Paihue, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the ""Giant Province of the Indies"", was born as a result of the struggle of local tribes with the Spanish conquerors in the 16th century".
The Spanish began a period of colonialism that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous people and identity.
Argentina is known as one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For competition news and tickets to polo matches, see Associação Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged from FIC West Store to the only bank in the islands located at Stanley.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards, as well as United States dollars, are also often accepted.
Although credit cards may not be accepted outside the islands, British and United States currency will be accepted; ask the owner in advance which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there.
Montevideo lies in the tropics, with temperatures over 30 °C in the summer months.
Winter will be deceptively cold: temperatures will rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity will make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no specific ""rainy"" and ""dry"" seasons: rainfall is about the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As tame as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the proper distance.
In addition, beware of odors that attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying smelly cooked food, and keep campsites clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous 1889 naval incident when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave their ports.
With the exception of one British cruiser, all the ships were sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city culminated in the assassination of the paramount chief Tapua Tamasese Lilofi III.
Auckland is located between two harbours and has many beaches. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are of the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
They're all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upper market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good chain of beachside shops.
"The main local beer is ""Number 1"", which is not a blended beer, but is enjoyable and refreshing. Other local beers are called ""Manta""".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may have a better reach.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it's also easy to find bottled water if you have concerns about safety.
The idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. The small black drink is an 'espresso', the cappuccino is served with cream (not whipped) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many visits to the dentist throughout the year, and injuries to the dentist from any of these causes are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found along the coast or near rivers between October and April in the north of 1770. They are occasionally seen outside during this time.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and stay out of the water.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the open ocean, their primary habitat being the tributaries north from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the passenger peace of mind that once they reach their destination, they will have somewhere to sleep.
Although deals are often made with specific hotels by travel agents, you can also book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation from the airport, and a combined airline and hotel package.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain some other document (e.g. a visa), they can also reserve a reservation.
Any changes or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, large numbers of attendees camp at the same location as the concert and most participants consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you have to come early and pitch your tent near the music.
Please note that although the music on the main stage has ended, some parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping sections for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as travelling through ice can be terribly confusing for those who are severely affected.
St. Petersburg cruises are permitted to spend time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from needing a visa (read conditions).
Casinos often go to great lengths to make guests spend as much of their time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are often absent, and it is very difficult to find a way out.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and keep them coming back.
Some venues provide alcoholic drinks at home. However, drinking affects judgment and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or on mountain roads should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snowy and icy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive on it like on an asphalt road.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to bury you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted due to snow falling on vehicle windows or snow drift or condensation.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries and traffic flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest driver of tourism in Africa and are a major attraction for many visitors.
Overland travel is addressed by the term safari in popular usage for viewing fascinating African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, can get very close to the car and you can see them very well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes hide and you can see them better with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""jungle walk"", ""hiking safari"", or ""walking"") involves hiking for several hours or several days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host 2 Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the lockdown was announced, you are in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but currently cancellation policies based on coronavirus at the end of March are not extended beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for most events will be between ¥2,500 and ¥1,30,000, with basic tickets costing ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels have ironing and ironing boards available for rent, even if there is not 1 person in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not feel comfortable using an iron, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (or it will shrink, or worse, burn).
There are various options for water purification, some more effective for certain organisms.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other areas, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Passengers may see insects that are not found in their compartments.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation or in the worst cases allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually considered pests.
Duty Free Shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempted from taxes and excise duties at selected locations.
For countries with heavy taxation, travellers can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The area between Point Marion and Fairmont creates challenging conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated wilderness.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, explain yourself: high grades, narrow streets and very winding roads.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and are more important to adhere to strictly than at other times.
Interestingly, cell phone service is much stronger than other parts of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and like their southern neighbour Austria, the pastries in Bavaria are just as rich and varied.
Since apples are available throughout the year, fruit pastries are common, with cherries and plums appearing in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes can be enjoyed especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but good-quality pastries, try Berliner, Funkuhn, or Kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
"The soil can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid material".
In North India and Pakistan, millet is used in rice dishes; while in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, the cuisine known as Indonesian cuisine includes a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But if more qualifying filters are used, the term originally meant this food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now ubiquitous throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes many seasonal dishes. Peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices are major ingredients in Javanese dishes.
The straps hanging on either side of the saddle are for supporting the rider's legs.
It provides more stability for the rider but can be a safety concern due to the possibility of entrapment of the rider's legs.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse will bolt if he tries to run away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions have been taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with heels and flat, fairly narrow soles.
Further, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow stirrup leather to fall under the saddle if the rider slips backwards.
Cocamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing site with distinctive granite walls and cones known as the Yosemite of South America.
The summits include breathtaking views of the peaks.Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly successfully exploring new routes in this boundless landscape.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, which include the popular sport of sliding downhill on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
"Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ""ski bombs"," and entire vacations can be planned around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing has been known as a sport since the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was started by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but generally does not include alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, as people then skied on slopes that required more skiers' skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In the best of circumstances, you will be able to cover some distance more than walking - but only rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling through many countries means going through visa applications and passport control many times.
Although it is a Schengen zone, it acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you spend time in this zone, you will not normally have to go through passport control checkpoints when crossing the border.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition stating that manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with lower age limits in places like North America compared to Europe.
Although handicraft products are smaller than similar mass-produced items, they can be described as antiques.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, but the culture associated with the industry is also important for many other occupations.
Traditionally, although not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and mostly used reindeer as a profitable animal.
