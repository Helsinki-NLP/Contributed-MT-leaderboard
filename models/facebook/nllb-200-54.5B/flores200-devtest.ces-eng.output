This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory that is now widely accepted) but also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and pale or carotenoid below.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed spine, called a rachis, but have other features -- rays and hooks -- the researchers reasoned that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display.
Scientists speculate that even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, it represents the plumage of an adult and not the feathers of a juvenile.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and consists of many small particles.

Their temperature changes are not as steady as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain relatively constant temperatures, but this is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope naming the candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law contains a fairly strict codification of the electoral procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were placed in them before voting began and that no envelopes other than those inserted by the enumerated and authorized voters were added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Other issues involved appear to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were closely supervised by rangers during the supplemental pest management study as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with the NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Shooting Sport Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of natural heritage conservation for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot received comprehensive safety training and drills.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said that 27 accidents involving the devices were known.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency says no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were soon released, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later substituted an elderly lady because she needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, in his spare time he became involved in premature births.
His research has shown that when the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" of flight data on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on a night when there were two moons in the sky. Unique as she was. She was a strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was crazy like me... maybe even crazier... I loved her and I'll miss her... maybe she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people taken before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disapproved of Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share that view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the spectrum, 29 percent believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his objections, his eligibility was questioned.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome the pain, as drugs are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people in early February using various hardware and software, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets formed, especially how the Earth has formed since comets collided with it long ago.
53-year-old Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and indiscretion".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions every year.
Compared with ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology that allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no emergency services, no overhead trains stopping at Wembley, no on-site parking or park-and-ride facilities.
Concerns about the lack of transportation options have increased the chances that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, whereas it was thought that the process took much longer because of breeding between endemic finches, Darwin's finches, and migrating cactus and conifer finches.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes, rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be melted or pressed into sheets.
It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed from them (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, resulting in a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in ancient Rome, they were sometimes part of public baths that men and women used together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite to make the call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then its signal bounces back down almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and field of view.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space requires a large rocket more than 100 feet in diameter.
The wheel has changed the world in unprecedented ways, most significantly by dramatically facilitating and speeding up transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose diet consists mainly of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in a system of ecological niches, that is, each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same genus (genus panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but more like a string of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals for food (prey) by scent, using their sense of smell to track their movements on the ground.
They can see very well at night because of their night vision and they can move very quietly, and they hunt by blending into their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (for example, when it crosses a mountain range or river or moves to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were the apex predators of their day, so they weren't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set planted in the top floor, which meant that anything that crossed its path had no chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had forked tongues, and their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like T. rex.
While most of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasting arrangements, involving wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a plch.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, whereas rich men liked to feast together, lying on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that did not reach Europe from the Americas or Asia until later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples and considered each of their gods to be its home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were merely open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all the countries were part of "Scandinavia", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think there was a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has writing on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is evident that the large parchment document (293⁄4 x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up and stored soon after its creation.
So it is likely that the inscription was added simply as an appendix.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles had brought liberation to northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched the invasion of southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned it over to Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, that is, together, they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means "civil", and it's related to the Latin "civis", which means "citizen", and also to "civitas", which means city or city-state, and it also sort of defines the size of a society.
The predecessors of nations were city-states.The culture of a civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces, and adequate diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on often uncooperative state agencies to enforce laws.
It also had no power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states underestimated the central government to the point that their representatives were often not present.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic trials.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
In view of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes called an "archipelago" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan and begins to transform native grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main hubs: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analog film era.
They are still produced today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has been adopted by digital camera sensor formats.
Although it is somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio in whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
Often misused and ridiculed, the "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamic order in a painting.
According to this specification, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had acquired wealth and power, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the central Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are there for that very purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the principle had been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain sailed through international waters to prevent any ships from reaching whole areas of ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine forces.
During the 1920's, pacifist and isolationist attitudes prevailed among most citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were eager to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were also unstable periods of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in a struggle for the throne in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, where instead of class-based ranks, there is now ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to try to start revolutions in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of mundane life and often visited a cave known as Hira on a mountain called Noor (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Located atop a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
There's nothing to see but a beautifully clear sky and a great number of surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidlike structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
An 'upward-pointing' sign looks like a V, and a 'downward-pointing' sign looks like a buckle or a square with no bottom.
Top means you start at the tip and push on the string, bottom means you start at the fret (where the hand is holding the string) and pull on the string.
An upstroke generally produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is louder and more penetrating.
You can write your own marks in pencil on the sheet, but keep in mind that the printed marks are there for a musical reason and should usually be followed.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Élisabeth-Philippe, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by an angry mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of the criminal group waved the head of the royal guard before the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of their expenses, while the interest on the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
The extra surplus value derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, represent the basic proceeds of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most believe ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
We can say, for example, that the advent of motor vehicles will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
But the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership has also led to an increase in traffic accidents, which has led to the development of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried with it a considerable element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geographically shaped individuals and the passage of time created customs and cultures associated with that geography and these, because they were consistent with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its importance declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders brought back to Europe such valuables as silks and spices that commanded a higher price than in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communications, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of this period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practised for the production of only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using seed indigenous to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left behind by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, because of neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wolf" children. Some wolf children have been imprisoned for long periods (usually by their own parents), in some cases living in abandonment because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma and then been abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
In the case of complete rearing by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits almost identical behaviour (within physical limits) to that of the caring animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
The framework is not a learning method, but rather a tool that provides support to those individuals undertaking the acquisition of a new skill, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or physical, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also a little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual constructs are incorporated into the software designed to analyze, motivate and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of proper nutrition, care, and education.
We believe the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide for any needs that were not met in the household from which it was previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are suggested as important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuing interest" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting micromessages - facial movements lasting just a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting microexpressions, you can tell if the other person is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle in both directions the differences between the two sets within each generation.
For primates with digestive systems similar to humans, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from the plant sources available in the open savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us as primates to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally awakening from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces one to get up and go to the toilet.
A person's level of inner calmness is inversely proportional to the level of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more good the life force can do.
Enlightenment is within everyone's reach, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple, they are kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. The clashes of systems, processes, and culture led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries at the end of the war.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was actually fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
Almost overnight, however, those plans were shattered when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transportation is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure a nation's ability to transport people and goods, but at the same time, the navy also had to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies failed, then Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures and were often tended by shepherds, often children or adolescents similar to the better-known sheep herders.
Horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although most carriage roads consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the teamsters to reach greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails were more effective if they had a strip of iron on their surface.
This became a common occurrence, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipeds appear in Australopithecus fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly lives, join environmental movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, this is the same as treating the symptoms, but unless it is a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
Then, after Congress passed it on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now called Dunlap copies.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The earliest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, a total of 25 prints from Dunlap's printing press.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many dinosaur-like markings on birds.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both insectivores and bedbugs are cunning, adapting to life in their host's nest or home.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can opt for a plan to adopt their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, and the scientific method actually guides most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations are also important to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend critically on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps time in a free-running cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether germline cells have been affected.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and as they do, others pass them on the way to the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone participates and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its steady state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed lands, you rarely find this level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has some reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, they are the only insects that cannot fold their wings, dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars) revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't look like it's moving, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in either size or technical precision.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most who work in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they occur in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract, even with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances that make up what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are classified as metals, but of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that the period at the end of this sentence could hold trillions of them.
That is why the pencil has been a good friend to many since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a secondary role.
People now type messages on computer screens, so they never touch the sharpener.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy truck up a hill, and then splitting the atomic nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with slight or even no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the inverted side and about 100 km thick on the inverted side.
It's weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side, because the crust is thinner there, so the lava could get to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on what people can relate to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can occur when managers begin to manage their former colleagues - peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, instituting discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're transformed beyond recognition, and you feel like you have to change everything the team does and make it your own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of an "invisible team" (Larson - LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
An "invisible team" is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used effectively across functional areas of the organisation.
As a result, an organization's process of collaborating to overcome a barrier can lead to new innovative processes for serving customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, its management needs to create an innovative corporate culture, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, thus narrowing and refining this area of research.
In their research, the scientists support a correlation between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models to help us understand what's going on in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become disciplines in their own right that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
An AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is embedded in a number of home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are an essential part of every course, and a teacher will often want to take her students to places where a bus ride is out of the question.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual field trips, where students can look at artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual field trip sharing is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital.
Blogs can also improve students' writing, and while their blogging is often marred by sloppy spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be aware of the world around them". The need to pique an audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "will allow students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their attitudes in the context of other texts and formulate their point of view on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond awaits discovery.
All this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas farther north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised to learn this demographic fact: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and can be considered a continent in its own right in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, where it flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers be reported as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful that it does not look too expensive).
Women should remember that cultural differences can sometimes lead to harassment and that it is not unusual for a man to follow a woman as she walks, hold her hand, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not excuse this!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets, especially in the center of town.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be carefully considered given the current state of fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo and offers some of the cheapest mountain gorilla viewing in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxis), which usually cost about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS program Wonders of the African World, hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it feels more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is an entrance fee and a conservation contribution.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wildlife Card, which allows entry into either selected parks in South Africa or into all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider a major tourist destination.
The array of buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape is likened to a shimmering bar graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's dense urban development is located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a site claimed by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest stretch of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganga plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian axis can currently be found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, we recommend buying a ticket several days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Oyapock River and connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m]. The bridge is 1,250 feet [378 m] long and has two lanes each 12 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, but you may be able to get by with British and U.S. currency.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make the exchange before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region, and during the summer months, temperatures commonly exceed 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be treacherously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with the wind and humidity, they appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: The amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals in the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Although appearing peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost all large animals can attack.
Many visitors are injured each year because they do not keep their distance.These animals are large, fierce and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Bear in mind, too, that bears and other wildlife are attracted to odors, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, has fewer than 40,000 inhabitants and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous 1889 naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau's campaign for independence, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, since Auckland lies between two harbors, and the most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after Mission Bay and St Heliers areas of central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is commonly available if you are concerned.
The idea of a flat white is foreign to Australians - a small black is an espresso, a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive but first-rate.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Still, accept the advice of authorities, follow road signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quadrangulars occur near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not actively live in the ocean, its primary refuge being an estuary just north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodations in advance gives the traveler confidence that he will have a place to stay at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, can also be booked through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about it or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any modifications or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the thick of the action, you'll need to arrive early to secure a campsite that's close to the music production.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival, the music may continue late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with small children.
If you are sailing across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as sailing through ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city; cruise passengers are not subject to visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try to make the guests spend as much time and money as possible in them. They usually lack windows and clocks, it is often difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep visitors happy and in the casino area.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain pass had to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as well as you can on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow falls in a very short period of time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow falling or flying or by dew or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without much disruption throughout the year.
A safari is probably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many it is the highlight of their trip.
The term safari, in its familiar sense, refers to traveling overland to view Africa's amazing wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, so standard equipment will give a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, making them easier to see through a telescope.
A tourist safari consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at various venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, this situation may be difficult for you.
Event cancellation policies may vary, but as late as March, most coronavirus-based event cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, the date the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause clumping or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it takes only a minute to boil water; in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Troublesome insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation or, in extreme cases, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can seriously injure or kill humans are usually not pests in themselves.
Duty-free is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and other charges in the areas concerned.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, exercise caution: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The maximum permitted speed is significantly lower here than on the upstream and downstream sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and its strict observance is even more important.
Interestingly, though, cell-phone service works far better here than in many sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, very similar to their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples used year-round, followed by cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want to try some hearty desserts, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to the cuisine of central and eastern Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes many simply seasoned dishes with a predominance of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups, which hang on either side of the saddle, support the rider's legs.
They provide more stability for the rider but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming trapped.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his leg gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run away, the rider can be pulled behind.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole that is quite narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety skids that allow the timing belt to fall off the saddle when pulled by a falling rider.
Chochamó Valley - a favorite mountaineering destination of the Chilean Prime Minister known as the Yosemite of South America, where extensive granite walls and cliffs can be found.
Mountaintops offer breathtaking views and climbers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails thanks to the endless potential of these walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skiing down snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a frequent travel activity with many fans sometimes known as ""ski walkers"", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational ski club opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires much sturdier skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than you can on foot - but you will rarely move as fast as you could if you were jogging without a heavy backpack and a modified trail.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through more than one country would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
However, in this respect the Schengen area operates much like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, where, for example, the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items may be classified as antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and a culture related to trade is also important for many other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer in large numbers. They subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region.
Although the term 'Gypsy' is widely used, particularly among the non-Roma population, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are going to visit becomes the subject of a travel advice, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may prefer to look at the advice of governments other than your own, but these are primarily for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The opinions presented are often cursory, general and over-simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and takes different forms that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy precipitation and fires are forms and effects of stormy weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any potential risks of adverse weather in their area, as this may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training" is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
The course usually deals in much greater detail with all the problems described here, usually also in the form of practical exercises.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-play based training, extensive first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an indication of gender (X) or documents updated to match the requested name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies.
Searches at security checkpoints became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through the scans and have their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are returning waves that crash onto a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and it is here that a fast current into deep water can be created.
Most deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether or not you've been spotted, wait for help.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture often have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home from abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have lost some habits from your home country.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
What people may not realize is that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the area's most popular attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
You usually hear tourists and vendors all the time, and the story of sounds and lights is like a storybook.
The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and each pyramid is illuminated in turn.
South Shetland, which was discovered in 1819, is claimed by more countries and has the most bases - there were 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains converge here into a plateau, and then re-emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains chain, which is split in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Ridge, is Antarctica's highest mountain range, Vinson Massif, with its 16,000-foot-high [4,892 m] peak, Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone because in order to make a call, you must be outdoors with no obstacles between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels and expeditions that need remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
Travel and learning are becoming increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year.
It is particularly popular with school leavers, enabling them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad after secondary school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
There will normally be tuition fees for enrolment in these programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
On islands and lakes, it is not necessary to have a yacht.
While the offshore archipelago and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland - there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
It is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this number is one in 40).
Baltic Sea cruises usually include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit this historic city for several full days and return to the ship at night to spend the night.
If you only go ashore as part of a cruise, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the tour.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it is their first flight or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions to other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help some people overcome fear of the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Freight forwarders are well paid for delivering goods quickly. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If the goods were sent by air freight, then on some routes it could take several days for the goods to be unloaded and cleared through customs.
The only way to do it faster is to send the item as checked baggage, but airline regulations prohibit sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly first or business class is to pull out a fat wad of cash (better yet, get your company to do it for you).
But it doesn't come cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the price of a regular economy ticket in business class and 11 times that in first class!
Generally speaking, it makes no sense at all to look for discounts on flights from A to B for first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the prices reflect that.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
The conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldovan Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of some 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, its second largest port after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.

Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

In this place, please behave with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't litter the area with signs or scrape graffiti off structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half of the population prefers Catalan, the vast majority understands it and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and inscriptions are only in Catalan, as this is the first official language established by law.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned outages are announced by the automatic system in many different languages - Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is to be on your best behavior, that is, to act like someone who is "bien élevé".
The outward impression that Parisians are somewhat fierce is quickly dispelled if you show at least basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Because of the variety of microclimates, soils, and altitudes, it supports a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
In addition to many common species, rare fauna can be found here, such as brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats, and grouse.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries provide plaids for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colorful one, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the supply at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns together with Sie (you) are always capitalized at the beginning and even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It probably also facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, since their pronunciation differs according to the vowel that follows them.
Note, too, the different pronunciations of r and rr: "caro" means "expensive", while "carro" means "car".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So if you read these grammar basics, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and get a better understanding of individual phrases.
Needless to say, if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now mostly obsolete and serve as museums or places for education.
Because light pollution at their peak was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were a popular flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to remove "just one".
If you visit a formal garden, you'll be thrown out for collecting "specimens".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to live in, easy to navigate, and where you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
"But since it's in the ""true tropics"" just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to deal with heat (always) and blazing sun (under clear skies, less often)".
Some buses also travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on holiday.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire and Rhine valleys, take a sightseeing tour of interesting towns on the Danube, or take a cruise on the Erie Canal.
They also identify popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by unbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition where people wake up on Easter night in some exposed spot to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well have been a pre-Christian celebration of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday nights during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often erupts in celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam there, flew there, or were carried there by wind or ocean currents.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to cover this distance, and the giant tortoise became the Galapagos' main grazer.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, a number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to observe the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for most of the time.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The standard business attire is a suit, and associates address one another by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, emphasising group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers must obtain the approval of their superiors for every decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
