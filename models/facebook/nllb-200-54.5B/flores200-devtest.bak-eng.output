This not only confirms a popular theory, such as that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides clues about color and three-dimensionality that fossils typically do not.
According to scientists, the plumage of these animals was reddish-brown above and pale or carrot-colored below.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed center called the rachis, but because feathers have other features such as spines and barbs, the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but possibly for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, this specimen represents the feathers of an adult rather than a juvenile bird.
Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers hypothesize that this specimen represents an adult feather rather than a juvenile bird.
Yesterday morning in Gaziantep, Turkey, two police officers were killed and more than twenty people were injured when a car bomb exploded in front of a police station.

The work performed was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team sought would be caused by wave forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
The Milky Way's gravitational pull on Sagittarius is similar to that of the moon on Earth.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in the form of a halo around the galaxy and consists of numerous small particles.

The voting procedure in France was low-tech: voters isolated themselves in a cabinet, put a pre-printed sheet of paper into an envelope with the name of the candidate of their choice.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral laws have traditionally codified the procedure strictly.

Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to special procedures.

He was initially hospitalised at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of the sheriff's son in an Edinburgh court.
He was remanded in custody awaiting trial and indictment, but any witness statements could be altered because his photograph had been widely published.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts look at the potential harm of publication photographs.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be moving into dangerous territory by publishing photographs of suspects".
In general, the Corona Administration, which is responsible for the prosecution, informed the journalists that it would not make any further comments.
The document touches on the controversy over borders, which caused an uproar, as Palestine wanted to base itself on the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
Other topics touched upon reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the problems of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA agreed to leave it for five years.
The shooters had to be supervised by rangers during the additional test on pest control, as the test was under control and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In partnership with the NPS and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (New South Wales) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sport Shooting Association's hunter program.
According to NPWS Acting Director for Park Preservation and Heritage Mick o' Flynn, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive instruction in safety techniques and training.
Yesterday Martelli swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (VEC).
This is the fifth CEP Martelli in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended that the former director general resign as part of a package of measures to push the country to new elections.
The Commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have erupted in the wake of failed elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
There have been 60 incidents of faulty iPods being set on fire, resulting in six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to this construction.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded that Apple's extension of the reporting period was "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday) in Mariana.
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that there were no reports of casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no tsunami warnings.
A former Philippine policeman in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, hijacked a bus carrying tourists from Hong Kong and took them hostage.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired at the tourists from an M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six hostages are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then substituted for an elderly woman who was going to the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began researching morning deliveries in her spare time.
Her research has shown that if you inject hormones, it accelerates the ripening of the fruit.
As reported by Xinhua, government investigators uncovered two of the "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer: "Luna was the first king of extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away two months ago.
Dustin "Goldast" Rannells commented that Luna was "as weird as I was...maybe even more so...I love her and miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
The number of Australians opposed to becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008, when 1,400 people were polled prior to the 2010 federal election.
The interim Prime Minister was Julia Gillard during the 2010 Federal Election campaign, in which she argued that Australia should become a Republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29% of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her physical fitness was called into question due to her complaint.
He was unable to take pain medication, which was prohibited in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of Computer Science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed this in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic matter along with the Earth, which could have formed oxygen and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have long encountered the Earth.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political mumbo-jumbo and nonsense".
He is expected to be elected to the presidency in 2016.
NextGen-FAA claims that the system will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, burn millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology that allows air traffic dispatchers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport to Wembley, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are insufficient parking and ground access facilities.
Due to the lack of transportation, the team was forced to play behind closed doors without their mother.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, reports the creation of a new species of Gal√°pagos bird on the Ecuadorian islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take longer due to the evolution of the endemic Darwin's, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant v—å—é—Ä–∫ –∫–∞–∫—Ç—É—Å, Geospiza conirostris.
All surrounding goldwork may be in the form of a small mould wrapped around the mould.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be twisted and spun, beaten with a hammer, or turned into a sheet.
It could be made so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate so-called "illustrated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether it contains acidic or basic (alkaline) chemicals.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (to pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, moist hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer to form an interesting-looking, uniform crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every household had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of a bathhouse, where men and women mingled in company.
When you make a call to someone more than a thousand miles away, you are using a satellite network.
The satellite receives the invitation in space, and then returns it there.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a large rocket more than 100 pounds in height.
The wheel has changed the world tremendously. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is make transportation much easier and much faster.
He gave us trains, automobiles, and many other means of transportation.
Under them, medium-sized cats, from rabbits to antelopes and deer, feed.
Finally, there are many cats that are small (including stray house cats) that eat far too many small prey such as insects, rodents, birds, and lizards.
The secret of their success is the main idea of the stories, that each cat has a special job that does not allow him to compete with others.
Lions are one of the most social cats, living in groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three older brothers, as well as up to thirty nieces and nephews.
Usually, the sisters and daughters form a large family, and the aunts are in close contact with each other.
Lions conduct themselves in prides much like wolves or dogs, and the animals are surprisingly lethal to lions (but not other big cats) in terms of behavior, as well as to their prey.
A well-built athlete can ride a tiger (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times with the strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
A tiger's roar is more like a sentence of jumbled shouted words than the full-throated roar of a lion.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, preferably monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow animals and locate them (the prey) by scent.
They have excellent night vision in the dark, but are also very inconspicuous. Mixing with the environment, ocelots hunt their prey, and then pounce on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from its parent population (e.g., by crossing a mountain range or river, or by moving to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it often ends up in a different environment than before.
There are other and different competitors in this new environment, so the new population will need other functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than the previous one.
The original population remained essentially unchanged, still needing to adapt as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the original population.
Eventually, in a thousand or a million years, the two peoples will be so different that they will no longer be identical.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the appearance of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb (breathe in) the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from the sun and to provide shade.
We use plants to make our homes, we use plants to make our clothes, we use plants to make much of our food, and without plants, no animals could live.
The mosasaur was considered the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and it had additional teeth in the upper part of its mouth so that no creature that crossed its path could escape.
It probably had a forked tongue, although this is not known with certainty. Its diet consisted mainly of crustaceans, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It attacked any creature that entered the water; not even Tyrannosaurus rex, thought to be a giant dinosaur, could stand against it.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or peculiar holiday foods, including wild boar, tauis, pigs, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that commoners and women ate on couches, while the rich preferred to eat in groups, reclining on them.
The ancient Roman diet did not include foods imported into Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Romans ate turkey.
The Babylonians built principal temples for each of their gods, which were viewed as the household of the deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests catered to their needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each synagogue had an open courtyard, after which came the inner sanctuary, where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special towers in the form of pyramids were built as part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warmer climates of the Middle East, the home was less important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
The women hid in front of the entrance; the stalls facing the street were shops.
In the land of Canaan, forests were scarce and timber was expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. The Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, then went west, found Greenland, and named it Greenland.
However, despite its discovery, it was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was a "Scandinavian country", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had many differences in population, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original of the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", which appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, this massive parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was originally wrapped for safekeeping.
So it is likely that the letter was added merely as a token.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had turned south towards Germany, liberating southern France.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, meaning citizenship, cognate with civis, meaning citizen; and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which in turn determines the size of a society.
The culture of a civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Secondary cultures often disappear without proper historical evidence, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War for Independence, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as the state had no executive or judicial system, it relied on the state governments, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
It also lacked the power to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before amendments could be made, and the states were so amenable to central authority that they often had no representatives.
The Italy national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful national football team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, roller hockey and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports, in which Italians participate in international games and Olympic competitions, are especially popular in the northern regions.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical position.
Taiwan traces its origins to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilya Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan and hired Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and southern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Many of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common format for photographing still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but most importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format, oddly enough, is 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Consequently, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the common ratio of all numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) are equal to or close to this aspect.
Often ignored, and often ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the amount of order in an image.
It states that the optimal location for the main object is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see Example).
Particularly notable in this period of European history was the wealth and power of the Catholic Church.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the peoples of Europe despite their differences in language and customs.
From commoners to kings, it influences everyone.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help the poor, and church funds were established for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had ruled in Rome for over a thousand years, and many felt that the concentration of so much power and wealth in one place was not conducive to the fulfillment of that religious law.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally recognized international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, cutting off vital war and civilian supplies.
Britain mined international waters to deny access to entire regions of the ocean, posing a threat even to neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and populations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of introduction to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, his former manager.
Ancient China had a peculiar way of representing different periods of time; each period of China's development or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with the division of provinces, the most notable of which was the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce wars between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of Ancient China: thousands of people died fighting for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and industrious to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as army ratings are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcended the mortal world. He frequently visited the cave known as "Hira" on Mount Nur (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself has been preserved from that time and gives a very vivid idea of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
Located at the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Nothing is visible except the clear blue sky above and the many mountains surrounding the cave. From inside the cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the original Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to our day.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small mausoleums, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is dedicated to the pharaoh Khufu, while most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are dedicated to Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for "upper curve" is the letter V, and the symbol for "lower curve" is a wedge or a square with the bottom removed.
The upper one means that you should push the bow starting from the bowstring, and the lower one means that you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where your hand is holding the bowstring).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more reliable.
Feel free to make your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed markings serve the music and must be respected.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Th√©r√®se and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 with a group of market women.
They returned to Paris in the carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed against the king and queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the group shakes the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The military costs of US imperialism's occupation of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the costs and a large portion of the interest on the bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the main achievement of U.S. imperialism will be the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that inspired the founding of the order.
The period in which the action takes place is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is conventionally dated to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a very broad spectrum of practices, ranging from the technological imperative or human destiny to logic based on scientific laws and their reflection in technology.
Interpretations of technological determinism are based on two assumptions: first, that technology develops independently of culture and politics, and second, that it affects natural society rather than social society.
For example, one might say that the automobile will inevitably lead to more roads.
The construction of an international road network for a few cars did not pay off economically, so new methods were developed in the automotive industry to reduce the cost of ownership.
The increased use of automobiles has led to an increase in the number of road accidents, which, in turn, has led to the development of new methods of treating injured people in the health sector.
In Romanticism there was a considerable element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures tied to this geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, in harmony with one's place in society.
While today's capital of Fashion is considered to be Paris, in the Middle Ages it was Constantinople.
Its reputation as an epicenter of wealth lasted from about 400 AD to 1100 AD.
In the course of the twentieth century, the city's status was somewhat downgraded as silk and spices were brought back from the Crusades at a much higher price than what was sold on the Byzantine market.
By this time, the capital of fashion had already shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of communication routes, western styles may be 25-30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style.
Natural farming is farming conducted to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds grown in an ecoregion, crop rotation, or other relatively simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who ignore society's standards and develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often identify themselves by a distinctive style and use of symbols, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most widely used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use a series of unsuccessful examples of children who were not socialized due to neglect, unhappiness, or abuse by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or "wild". Some children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); others have been abandoned by their parents because of their inability to accept their mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may be severely injured or killed before being abandoned or escaping.
The rest were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived independently in the wild.
Raised almost exclusively by non-human animals, feral children display almost entirely animal-like behaviors (within the limits of their physical capabilities), such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, construction publications go further.
Construction publications are not a teaching method, but rather a way to help people learn something new, such as using new computer technology or starting a new project.
Publications can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is the form of the publication, like the sticky person in Microsoft Office.
Virtual editions are embedded in the software and are designed to ask, teach, and explain procedures that are difficult for a student to do alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even threats of robbery.
No child should ever have to grow up without care, nurturing and education, but they do.
We perceive the system of patronage education as a zone of safety for these children.
Our system of foster care should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
It is assumed that the adoptive family should provide them with everything they need that they did not have in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of broadband and telecommunications.
The special characteristics of the Internet have led to the discovery of additional dimensions, such as conditions of use and methods of promotion.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have also been found to be important motivations in Internet use (James et al. 1995).
In the course of studying audience reactions to websites, Aimee and McCord (1998) identified the terms "personal engagement" and "long-term relationships" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microscopic facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting his or her microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks points out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity correctly.
He even speculated that such abilities to understand human behavior might be inherent in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the open variation pool.
Segregation and recombination carry variation back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would find it difficult to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources alone.
In addition, failure to meet this need leads to serious consequences such as growth retardation, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Proteins in leaves and legumes would be a usable plant resource, but primates like us are ill-prepared to process them.
Animal products (ants, termites, eggs), on the contrary, are not only easily digestible, but also rich in proteins containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" better than the savannah chimpanzee does today.
Sleep disruption is the intentional waking up during a normal period of sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by using a silent alarm clock that can awaken you without waking you up completely.
If you find that you have put your alarm clock back while you are asleep, set it on the opposite side of the room so that you do not have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other variations based on biorhythms involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, certain diuretics), forcing the person to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has contrasts with the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the opportunity to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by many of the techniques of Mahayana love and Indian yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of inner illumination) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Divine Yoga is the center of Tibetan medicine. Visualizing various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates enlightenment of the mind.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the separation of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last another 40 years, and it would be fought by real proxy armies from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup on the Romanian beachhead.
However, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, the Soviet Union created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts with over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army.
The use of transport ships is currently the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
A navy's job is usually to ensure your country's ability to transport your people and goods to you and to prevent your enemies from transporting their people and goods to you.
One of the last notable examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet tried to stop this movement, mainly using submarines.
In the event of an Allied defeat, Germany might well have invaded Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
The first goats were probably domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes raised them for their milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were mainly kept in herds, roaming on hills and other pastures, and tended by shepherds, often children or youths, whose methods were similar to those of established shepherds.
Ice skating was first developed in England in the 16th century.
Although the conca consisted of simple wooden planks laid parallel, it allowed horses to gain greater speed and carry heavier loads, somewhat better than uneven roads.
Initially, the sleepers were used only to hold the rails together, but gradually experts realized that a metal strip over the rails would be more useful.
This came into general use, but the iron tops of the rails caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out quickly.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first railway was opened in 1767.
Humans have walked since the appearance of Homo erectus (upright man) two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright.
Among the fossilized remains of Australopithecus, which lived between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, bipedal forms have been found, although the salehanthropus may have begun to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can do our part to reduce future suffering by being kinder to nature, by joining environmental movements, and even by becoming activists.
In many ways, this is similar to treating the symptoms, but if we don't want short-term solutions, we need to get to the root of the problem.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems associated with overpopulation and human overexploitation are increasing.
After its adoption by Congress, the draft manuscript, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away on July 4.
About 150 to 200 copies of what are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" were made in one night.
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. The copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap copies are the earliest known copies of the document. The handwritten original has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs still alive today is what we call birds.
Many people do not think of birds as dinosaurs because birds have wings and can fly.
Nevertheless, many similarities can be seen in the appearance of birds and dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like the T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values - either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or, in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be readily apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are frequent and difficult to diagnose.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific instructions on first aid for this poison.
For this group of insects, the term "beetle" is used formally by entomologists.
The term comes from the frequent encounters with bed bugs, which are among the most common parasitic insects on humans.
Bed bugs, like assassin bugs, build nests or live in the nests of their hosts.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been diagnosed in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are affected twice as often as men with multiple sclerosis.
A couple may conclude that having children is not in their best interests or is not a priority.
These couples can make adoption plans for their children.
In the process of adoption, the child's biological parents are deprived of parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world is constructed using the scientific method, which, in fact, guides most scientific research.
However, this method is not the only way to conduct experiments, and an experiment is an investigation used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, which also give direction to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers turned their attention to classical texts, especially the Bible and writings in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were adopted.
As the demand for the study of Greek waned, Western scholars distanced themselves from Greek philosophy and its scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are especially subject to internal cycles and their workings according to biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are more than simple reactions to external stimuli, have been found in many animals, bacteria, fungi, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining generator that continues its cycle of voluntary cycles regardless of the presence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's work was one of the key hypotheses proving the existence of DNA as genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling DNA inside a phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeling a phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material that is mutated, and the presence or absence of germline cells, alterations may occur.
A mutation can be inherited only if it occurs in cells of the germ line, while a mutation elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is of particular interest to those who travel to natural areas to enjoy the scenery and observe the flora and fauna.
Outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
For example, I went to the island of Borneo to photograph and study orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small provincial towns in their cars and head to their places of employment, only to encounter others traveling in the opposite direction.
In this dynamic transport flow, everyone interacts and contributes to some degree to the automobile-based transportation system.
Today's science clearly demonstrates how this massive coal economy reversed one of the stable states of the biosphere that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about it.
In the developing world, you will rarely hear people complain about bad water or a broken bridge.
Why does the transport system generate so much dissatisfaction, why does it experience difficulties on a daily basis?
Transport flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one place to another and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is very difficult, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with one hundred percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers often act in a predetermined sequence; therefore, traffic flows have a predetermined sequence and can be approximated by mathematical methods.
To better describe the flow of motion, the relationships between three important estimators - (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity - are studied.
These contacts are very helpful during the planning phase, when constructing facilities and building road facilities.
The first animals to take to the air were insects, whose ability to fly made it easier for them to evade predators and more efficient at finding food and prey.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings over the back.
Thus, they can more easily find small areas to hide from predators.
Today there are only two insects that cannot fold their wings on their backs - the dragonfly and the dragonfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some believe it to be true, but most believe the opposite - that the solar system revolves around the Earth along with the Sun.
This seems reasonable, since the rotation of the earth is invisible, does it not?
The Amazon is the second-longest river in the world and one of the largest rivers in the world, with a volume of water 8 times greater than that of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also considered the widest river in the world, reaching six miles in width in some places.
About 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were not surpassed in size or quality of construction.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom period marveled at the monuments built by their ancestors, whose age at that time was already considered to be a thousand years.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest sovereign state and the least densely populated country in the world.
The Italian language is used for legislation and official communication in the Vatican.
Italian was also used in everyday life by many in government service, while Latin was used mainly in religious services.
Most of the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been aware of the existence of basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they occur in nature in their basic forms and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the great philosopher, theorized that all things are composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Much of this has to do with the four states of matter (in that order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma - which he also suggests can change from one state to another to form the bodies we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals such as silver or gold.
Among the alloys you can also find small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
That is why the pen has been a good friend to many people since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the development of new forms of writing, the status of the pencil declined and its use became rare.
Today, people can type messages on computer screens without ever picking up a pencil.
It is hard to imagine how the keyboard will change in the future.
The working principle of an atomic bomb is that it requires a large amount of energy to fuse the nucleus of an atom with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill with something.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning that they will break apart under the slightest pressure.
The Moon's surface is covered with a thick outer layer of rock and dust called the crust.
The thickness of the Moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is shallower in the lowlands and thicker in the foothills.
Since the crust is thinner closer to the Earth, there may have been more oceans, allowing the lava to rise more easily.
Content theories are based on the search for what people are interested in and what they like.
According to these theories, each person has certain desires and needs that are learned as they grow up.
These theories attempt to answer the question of what motivates people to do what they want to do and what conditions in the environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Gertzberg's "Two Factor" theory.
In general, managers exhibit two types of behavior when they begin to lead their former peers. At one end of this spectrum are those who want to remain "our own guy" (or girl).
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, establishing order, improving performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the leader becomes unrecognizable, wanting to change everything about the group's work independently.
After this, the leader is considered more responsible for the successes and failures in the work of the group.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams share many of the same quality standards as regular teams, but there are some differences.
A virtual team often serves as a means of communication for a physical group.
They often have more autonomy than typical team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, and may not satisfy their local supervisors.
The existence of a true "secret group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is another difference from virtual teams.
A "secret group" is a local leadership team of group members that sets standards for everyone in the team.
One of the goals is that the implementation of the organization's learning processes promotes innovation.
If all functional departments make extensive use of available resources, then creativity and ingenuity spread throughout the organization.
As a result, when organizations work together to overcome barriers, meeting the needs of the customer creates a new innovative process.
For an organization to be called innovative, the leadership needs to build a culture of innovation along with disseminating knowledge and organizing training within the organization.
Angell (2006) defines the Continuum Approach as a method used to help an organization increase production.
Neurobiological data physically support the study of cognition, thus helping to broaden and refine the field of research.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the main hypothesis supporting the researchers.
It has long been recognized that brain injuries, trauma, and malignancies have a direct impact on human behavior.
The development of new technologies has enabled us to study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which helps us understand many processes in the brain.
Although AI has the feel of science fiction, it is an important branch of informatics that deals with machine learning, education, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes the development of machines to automate tasks that require conscious thought.
Responsibilities include control, planning and scheduling, responding to customer complaints and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things became separate disciplines aimed at solving real-life problems.
Currently, the AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it is included in several software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of any learning process, and often the teacher wants to take the children to places where they cannot go by bus.
The technology offers virtual excursions where students can sit in their classrooms and view museum exhibits, admire an aquarium, or admire fine art.
A virtual tour is also a good way to discuss the trip and share experiences with your future classmates.
For example, in North Carolina, students at the Bennett School create an annual website about their visit to the state capital, which is updated, but the old version remains on the Internet and serves as an album for samples.
Blogs can also help students write better. Students often make grammatical and spelling mistakes when starting a blog, but users usually correct them.
Students are often critical users, so the author of the blog tries to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging forces the student to better understand the world around them. They are encouraged to be smart and interesting in order to arouse interest in the user (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning, usually outside of school.
Appropriate use of blogs allows readers to be analytical and critical; by responding to the demands of the Internet, readers can establish their own position in the context of other works, as well as form their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada and is home to many art galleries and museums showcasing the country's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and beyond to the north is Muscooka, a haven of unspoiled natural beauty.
All of this is typical of Ontario, which foreigners consider part of Canada.
Large areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
This comparison surprised many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought with them Islam, which became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear rings (only those that do not seem too expensive).
Women should be aware of cultural differences: they may be followed or grabbed by the hand.
Firmly reject men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (culturally different or not, this is not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Barbary fishermen and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marines under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The sultan of Morocco built the city as Dar al-Madinah, and it received the name Casablanca from the Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
There are no interesting things to buy in Casablanca.
Traditional Moroccan goods such as stoneware, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and souvenirs are easy to find around the Old Medina, but they are mostly for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
Goma was devastated in 2002 by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded many streets, especially in the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, outside of Goma it is important to be aware of the ongoing hostilities in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for treks to the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest routes to observe mountain gorillas in Africa.
To get around in Goma you can use boda-boda (mototaxi). The usual (local) fare for short distances is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land that is not easily accessible.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is known as a tourist city and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to Desert Sand.
This was one of the highlights of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "African Wonders of the World".
This city differs dramatically from others in that it has more of an Arab than an African flavor.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 zones, each of which contributes to the preservation of wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's major attractions, and it is considered to be the precursor of the country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a charge for conservation and entrance.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered a major tourist attraction by many visitors.
The alignment of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong can be compared to a glowing histogram indicating the presence of water in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of Hong Kong Island's buildings are densely built on reclaimed land on the northern coast.
The area was claimed by the British, and is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of earlier colonial years.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coasts of Bangladesh and India to the interior.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest in India is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also contain remnants of the once mighty jungle that covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is in the water/wetland district.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority leave between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakhar/Bumtang.
Since inter-district buses are often full, tickets must be purchased several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and have two aisles with a length of 378 meters and a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, in time for the expected completion of construction of Brazilian customs points.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group settled in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagua, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "Giant Province of India", Paraguay was born in the 16th century as a result of clashes between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the polo fields of Las Ca√±itas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
News about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are commonly accepted anywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, and British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check with hosts in advance to determine the most convenient payment method.
Falkland currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer here, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 ¬∞C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation remains the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park administration recommends that you stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] away from all other wildlife!
Bison, elk, bears, and almost any other large animal may attack, no matter how docile they seem.
Dozens of people are injured each year because of not keeping their distance. These animals can be large, wild, and dangerous, so keep your distance.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells bad, and keep campgrounds clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor became notorious in 1889 for a naval confrontation in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All but one of the British ships were sunk, with the loss of about 200 men from the U.S. and Germany.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the death of the chief leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's location between two harbours, it has a large number of beaches, the most popular of which are in these three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean coastline, stretching from Long Bay to Davenport.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many have extensive shade trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the heart of Auckland - in the prestigious areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
Some are family friendly beaches with lots of people and shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One", simple but delicious and hearty, while the second local beer is called "Manta".
French wines are plentiful, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more affordable.
Water from the local tap is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. "Short black" is "espresso", "cappuccino" is served with condensed milk (not foam) poured in bulk, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are organized year-round and reef-related injuries are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all instructions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been found near beaches and estuaries as far north as 1770 from October to the end of April, and occasionally beyond.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat being the river banks north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking assures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Most travel agents work with individual hotels, but you may also find it possible to book other types of accommodation through an agent, such as camping.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
Any corrections or requests should be made first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
Some festivals, such as music festivals, have a majority of attendees decide to camp on site, with the majority of attendees considering it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you should arrive early to camp close to the music.
Keep in mind that there may be sections of the festival that play music all night long, even if the music has ended on the main stages.
At some festivals there are special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of your cabin, as crossing the ice can be very noisy for very tired people.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically strive to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no clocks with windows, and it may be difficult to find an exit.
They have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and in their rooms.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages, but alcohol impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who intends to walk in high latitudes or cross mountain passes must take into account snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
There is less friction on icy and snowy roads, and you cannot drive as if you were barefoot on asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow may fall and freeze in a short time.
There may also be reduced visibility due to snow, fog, or the sweating of car windows or ice.
On the other hand, ice and snow are commonplace in many countries, and traffic is basically uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the most attractive part of Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a journey overland to view the spectacular wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and standard equipment allows good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bushwalk", "hike safari" or "walking safari") is a walking trip that lasts several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo was the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most of the prohibition policies based on the coronavirus in late March will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets are expected to cost around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothing will help keep it clean. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear non-iron socks, use a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it may set or burn).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some regions, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have problems, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar animal pests in their regions.
Pests can spoil food or irritate the body, in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or transmit infections.
Animals that are capable of transmitting infectious diseases or killing people by force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free trade is the practice of purchasing goods at specific locations that are exempt from certain taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes leave behind large sums of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is often considered the most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Road to drive, as it passes through heavily wooded, isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
Recommended speeds are much lower than those of the preceding and following sections - typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is more important than vice versa.
Interestingly, mobile phone coverage here is much better than many other sections of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are excellent, and Bavaria, like its southern neighbour Austria, has a rich and varied cuisine.
Fruit-based pastries are common: apples are available year-round, while cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German cakes contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often accompanied by a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but tasty and nutritious meal, try a regional Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krappen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the liquid content.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions, coconut milk is usually used.
"17 000 islands to choose from" is an umbrella term encompassing the wide variety of local cuisines that can be found throughout Indonesia.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to a dish originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently, Javanese cuisine is widespread throughout the archipelago and includes many simple cooked dishes, although most Javanese dishes are flavored with peanuts, chilies, sugar (Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The uzan is a support for the rider's legs that hangs on either side of the saddle.
They provide stability for the rider, but are also a hazard, as they can trap a rider's legs.
If the rider is thrown from the horse, but the leg remains on the rein, the horse may pull the rider away. To reduce this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wore smooth-heeled, narrow-soled boots.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have protective lugs that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the falling rider is pulled back.
The Cochamo Valley, known as the Yosemite of South America, is Chile's premier rock climbing area with massive granite walls.
Alpinists from all over the world are constantly laying new routes between the boundless potential of the walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and sometimes amateurs, known as "ski bums", spend an entire vacation planning to ski somewhere.
The idea of skiing is very old - rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This is also called skiing or ski tourism.
It is closely related to, but not usually associated with, ski tourism or alpine style alpinism, the latter of which is practiced on steep slopes and requires even stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover several times the distance of walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of racing skis without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one with a number of independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to pass through visa control and passport control many times.
However, the Schengen Area operates as a single country in this respect.
If you stay in this zone, as a rule, you can cross the border without going through passport control again.
It is not necessary to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen Zone member states, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities consider items more than 100 years old to be antiques.
There is a geographical variation of this designation, where age restrictions are more important in places such as North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques even if they are mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is a source of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for many other professions.
However, even by tradition, not all Saami engaged in large-scale rearing of reindeer, but lived from fishing, hunting, etc., and reindeer were mainly used for riding.
Today, many of the Saami have modern trades. Tourism - the Saami pottery has been a source of income in S√°pmi.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-gypsies, it is often considered derogatory due to negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If travel advice is circulated in the country where you have collected it, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
You can also consult with governments other than your own, but their advice is for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens may encounter situations in the Middle East that differ from those of Europeans or Arabs.
A consultation is simply a brief description of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and simplified compared to the comprehensive information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather condition that may cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, precipitation, and forest fires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of weather hazards affecting the area, as they can affect various travel plans.
Anyone who wants to go to a country that is considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile environment" will likely return the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, taking into account practical experience.
The course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines devoted to wildlife survival are widespread, but few are devoted to the war zone.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid travel documents for their return.
Governmental policies on issuing gender-neutral passports or special documents to conform to a person's preferred name or gender may vary from country to country.
The willingness of governments abroad to endorse such documents also varies.
Following the events of September 11, 2001, checkpoints were further tightened.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should be prepared to provide full information about themselves during the screening, even if it means compromising their reputation.
A rebound wave is a wave that originates at the shore and then travels over a reef or similar body of water.
Depending on the underwater topography, the returning wave gathers in several deep places, where it forms a deep and fast current.
Most deaths occur when people swim against the current, sometimes making it impossible to swim out.
Even when you are free of the current, swimming toward the shore may seem difficult.
If your rescuers can see where you are, it may be better to wait until help arrives.
The return shock starts earlier than the cultural shock (which has a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be much more difficult.
Travelers who are accustomed to a new culture may find it especially difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adjusted to a new culture and have lost some of your traditional practices.
When you first arrived in a new land, people were likely patient and understanding. They knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
What people may not realize is that patience and understanding are essential for returning travelers.
The most interesting entertainment for children near the pyramids is a sound and light show.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the hustle and bustle of tourists and vendors, and the sound and light story is like a collection of stories.
The Sphinx was installed as a backdrop and narrator of a long history.
Scenes were shot in the pyramids and various pyramids were illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and are the site of numerous bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the Villa Las Estrellas estate is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau here, and then emerge again, forming the 360-kilometer-long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is Mount Vinson, the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only recourse.
Satellite phones do not usually replace mobile phones, as you need to be in clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is most often used by shipping companies, including vessels transporting vacationers, as well as expeditions with the need for long-distance data transmission and voice communication.
Your local telephone provider should be able to provide you with additional information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and study.
This is especially convenient for school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before entering university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, enrolling in a year-long study abroad program may actually increase your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
As a rule, tuition is charged for participation in these educational programs.
Finland is a great place for sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, which are located in the middle of lakes or in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on an archipelago or a lake.
Although the coastal archipelagos and some of the lakes are large enough for sailing, smaller boats and kayaks are more interesting.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is on a par with the numbers in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is nevertheless unique compared to other countries (for example, the Netherlands has one boat per forty people).
Most of the unique cruises along the Baltic Sea involve a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can spend a full day or two in the historic city, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore using the ship's excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures mention Berlin (Germany). As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be dangerous for people of all ages and life experiences, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no need to feel ashamed: this is no different from the personal fears and dislikes that many people have.
For some, an understanding of how airplanes work and what to expect during a flight can help overcome fears based on uncertainty or uncontrollability.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Time is of the essence for working documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air, some routes could take several days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to expedite it is to check it in as checked baggage, as airline rules prohibit them from sending unchecked baggage to a destination.
A common reason for flying first or business class is to pay a premium for the privilege (or, preferably, charge your airline).
But it is not cheap: you can expect to pay roughly four times as much for business class and eleven times as much for first class as you would for economy!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a subset of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for a fast and convenient ride.
The capital of Moldova is Chi»ôinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic plagued by ethnic conflict.
This conflict led to the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova were re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, prosperous and lively commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, old mosques and churches are interspersed among wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, but the city has a stronger Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard above some of the graves there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It takes about half an hour to walk around the picturesque village.
To the north, within easy reach, is the romantic and wonderful city of Sintra, made famous abroad by Lord Byron's vivid description of its beauty.
Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the magnificent Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, the world-famous site of Mary's apparition.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave, as well as a place of unspeakable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their time here, many of them Jewish or non-Jewish who worked here before their relatives were killed or died.
Please treat this site with the respect, dignity, and reverence it deserves.
Do not deface structures with graffiti or markings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan, which is designated by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is widely spoken on public transportation and elsewhere.
Announcements in the metro are usually only in Catalan, but during unexpected disruptions the automated system makes announcements in Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians were known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is largely a mistaken stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is to behave like a "bien √©lev√©" (well-mannered) person.
If you show a little common courtesy, the outward rudeness of the Parisians will disappear immediately.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is mainly covered by thick forests of beech, fir and spruce, with a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is characterized by a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of microclimates, soils, and altitudes above sea level.
The region is also home to many species of animals and birds.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, fox, lynx, wild cat, wild boar, as well as common species can be found here.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to cover their shoulders and wear skirts that cover their knees.
Most monasteries provide items for unprepared women, but bring your own, especially if they are brightly colored, and you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the door.
Men were also required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be obtained from the stock near the door, but the garment is not washed after each use, so you will not feel comfortable in this skirt.
Like the cuisine of similar regions in the Mediterranean, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), while olive oil is used in all dishes.
A popular simple dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: olive oil, tomatoes and cheese, tuna, and bread sprinkled with various spices are on hand.
All nouns, along with the word Sie, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
This may complicate writing somewhat because of the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form, but it nevertheless makes it easier to read.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced as they are written.
The key letters to note are "c" and "g", as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also, remember to pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: "karo" means dear, and "karro" means cart.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and basically stable.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn more about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Needless to say, learning Portuguese will be easier if you know a Romance language.
However, those with some knowledge of Spanish may conclude that Portuguese is close enough that there is no need to learn it separately.
Prior to modern times, observatories were typically obsolete, remaining little more than museums or educational institutions.
In their heyday, radiation exposure was not as much of a problem as it is today, so they were usually located in cities or university campuses and were more easily accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are large installations located in remote regions with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The spectacle of the blossoming of the cherry blossom - known as hanami - has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were chosen.
The first sakura shows in Japan were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick just one.
If you go to a formal garden and "collect specimens", you will be thrown out without warning.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, it is very convenient to travel, and you can buy everything you need when you arrive.
But at the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with heat (always) and scorching sun (rarely, when the sky is clear).
Several buses travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
You should know that the bus you are about to board is not going to the city of Arba in Judah but to Hebron.
For recreation, inland waterways are a good place to walk.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise on the Danube to visit attractions, or sailing on the Erie Canal.
They also designate popular routes for hiking and biking.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of the Christian religion and is celebrated to mark the birth of Jesus.
Many of the customs associated with Christmas have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is customary to hold a vigil in the open air on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a spring and fertility rite in pre-Christian times.
Traditional churches hold vigils on the night before the Sabbath during the Easter season, while communities begin the celebration at exactly midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of its remoteness from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, so the giant tortoise was the only grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Gal√°pagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will see polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky will be quite dark around the clock.
Because of the short life span of humans, the light is not blocked, so you can still enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is much more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The suits are standard work clothes, and employees address each other by their surname or position.
Harmony in the workplace, with emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievement, is vital.
Employees must have the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions implicitly.
