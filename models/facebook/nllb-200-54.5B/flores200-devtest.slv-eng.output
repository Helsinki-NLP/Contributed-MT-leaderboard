This confirms the long-held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also offers insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack the well-developed scales called ribs, but have all the other characteristics of feathers - branches and hooks - researchers have concluded that ribs very likely evolved later in evolution than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used, not for flight, but for temperature control or display. Although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers say that the pattern indicates that the feathers are those of an adult and not those of a baby.

In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with a marked choice into an envelope.
Once the identity of the voter has been verified by officials, the envelope is placed in the ballot box and the voter is signed in the electoral register.
The French electoral law lays down a fairly strict procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope has been placed in them at the beginning of the election and that no envelope has been added other than those delivered by duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process.In the evening, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes, following established procedures.

This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the court has ruled that the publication of photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists are on thin ice if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is solely responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that it will not comment further, at least until the indictment.
It was revealed that the document would deal with the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics to be discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, considered holy in both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority has agreed to only five years of such a presence.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiment were closely monitored by the keepers as the experiment is monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the auspices of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of parks and heritage conservation for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have triggered failed elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of an additional 34 overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-hazardous".
The department's response was that Apple's postponement of the report was "deeply regrettable".
Mariano was hit at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and joined the National Hospital for Women in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research indicates that when the hormone is added to the baby, fetal lung development is accelerated.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two of the plane's "black boxes" on Wednesday.
The moon was also bowed to by fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. She was as unique as she was herself. She was a strong woman", said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as I was ... maybe even weirder ... I love her and will miss her ... hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her view Australia should become a republic after the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with the request that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
On the one hand, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his problems made his fitness questionable.
He wasn't allowed to take the painkillers he needs because they're forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery, announced on Tuesday, was confirmed by several people by early February using different hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source that brought water and organic materials to earth, from which proteins can be made and which make life possible.
Scientists hope to learn how planets form, especially how the earth formed, since comets have long since collided with the earth.
Cuomo, 53, was sworn in as governor earlier this year and last month endorsed legislation to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He's projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older fixed-radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be offered and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley, while car parks and park-and-ride services on the surface will not be available.
Due to fears of a lack of transport links, there is a possibility that the game will be forced behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A new species of bird has appeared in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, have reported a new species that evolved by crossing the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, with the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza fortes, in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes.
It can be spun into a fine wire that can be twisted and braided, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand paintings in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called a pH chemical, and you can make an indicator with just red cabbage juice.
Vegetable juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of crust.
At Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet in diameter.
The bicycle has completely changed the world, and one of its most visible contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It brought us the train, the automobile, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelope to deer.
But there are also many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the niche, the special job each cat has to protect itself from competition.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The pride consists of one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Like a large family of sisters and daughters, the women are usually close to one another.
A pride of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats) but also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not the best), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not as full and unified as a lion's but is more like a muffled growl or a shriek.
Ocelots feed on small animals, preying on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by using their sense of smell to locate prey on the ground.
Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then leaping out to attack their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it lived in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population over time.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Photosynthetic plants use the sun to produce food and also provide shade.
We use plants to make our houses and clothes, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and it had additional teeth in its palate, so that it devoured everything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water, even huge dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex.
While much of their food may seem familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual holiday foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called polh.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs at meals, the rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each god, the Babylonians built a central temple that was supposed to be the home of the respective deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods by their rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, and timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that he discovered Greenland on his journey west and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, their people, kings, customs, and history differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence depicts a treasure map.
Despite what it says on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" were written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment document (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) began its life as a scroll.
It is therefore possible that the footnote was simply added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, northern France was liberated, but the south was still unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces occupied southern France in an invasion code-named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were marching on Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of individuals living and cooperating together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, in a way that also indicates the size of a society.
City-states are precursors to nations. The culture of a civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and significant diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states with the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government - consisting of only a congress.
Congress did not have the power to enforce the tariff, but because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments, often unwilling to cooperate, to enforce its laws.
Moreover, it had no power to nullify tax laws and tariffs between states.
The agreement of all the Länder was required to amend the articles, but the individual Länder did not take the central authorities seriously and their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern provinces, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, from a geographical point of view, it's often called an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began transforming native methods of grain production and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, military forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's west and north coast, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Tower of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to help tourists visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has also been adopted by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually - and somewhat unusually - 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the most basic integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the ASP family of formats) have the same or very close to this height-to-width ratio.
Often exploited and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while providing a standard for image editing.
According to him, the most effective place for the main subject should be at the intersection of lines that divide the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny, enriching itself and extending its power.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European countries despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected kings and commoners alike.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used for that very purpose.
The church's central authority has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it is really following that principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off key military and civilian supplies proved effective, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to deny ships access to entire areas of ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant views of most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he had with him only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager of his former business), addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China displayed different periods of time in a particular way; each stage of China or each ruling family was a recognizable dynasty.
There were also periods of instability between individual dynasties, when provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for control of the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in a struggle for supremacy in the great palace at Xi'an.
The social and political effects are many, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Moreover, the professions after the revolution were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is also true in the military, where military ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was intensely interested in things beyond this earthly life, and he visited a cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
Located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists, and the interior of the cave offers complete solitude.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol for 'lock up' looks like a V and the symbol for 'lock down' looks like a buckle or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it down, down means you should start at the bowstring (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A stroke from above usually produces a softer sound, while a stroke from below is stronger and more forceful.
If you wish, you may use a pencil to trace your bow marks, but remember that the printed bow marks are provided for musical reasons and should be followed.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young children, 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by an angry mob to retreat from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw open their carriage windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved to the terrified queen the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the windfall profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would represent a basic revenue stream for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context in which they created the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are conventionally dated to around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently causes "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that as the automobile evolved, so the roads would evolve.
However, the national road network cannot be economically justified for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the roads, which leads to the development of new medical techniques for treating injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, which he drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geography, and over time, customs and culture associated with a particular geographic area emerged that were congruent with the state of society and thus superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
Its status declined somewhat in the 12th century, as crusaders returned home with gifts of silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
During this time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing in the East had a strong Byzantine influence.
However, because of slow communications, Western styles may have lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europeans began to develop their own styles, and one of the major developments of the time, a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is the term used for farming which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses saved seeds originating from the same ecological region in combination with crop rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social norms and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at some of the unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they were growing up because of neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate abuse.
Some wolf children were imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); this form of child abuse was in some cases the result of rejection of the child's more severely mentally or physically disabled parent.
Before they were abandoned or ran away, feral children may have been severely abused or traumatized as children.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When feral children are raised entirely by nonhuman animals, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost exactly the same as that of animal caretakers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, skilling goes a step further.
Scratching is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Stages can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of stage, but so is a little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are built into the software and are intended to ask questions, stimulate and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and nurturing, but it is.
We think the foster system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care was supposed to provide all the necessities of life that they did not have in the home from which they had been taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The intrinsic characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and access to rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are said to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied how audiences respond to websites.
Video recordings have provided important insights into the interpretation of microtraumas, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, they say that correct interpretation of microexpressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century suggests that there are two sets of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistributes variation back and forth between the two sets.
A primate with a human-like digestive system, with the plant resources available in the savannah, has difficulty meeting its amino acid needs.
Moreover, if this need cannot be met, there are serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, which primates, including us, find difficult to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also a source of high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking you up at your normal sleep time and putting you back to sleep quickly (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will put you to sleep but not wake you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room and force yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up and go to the water.
The amount of inner peace one has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present, and each person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is within the reach of everyone, and the only obstacle to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Although Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, it also draws on the Mahayana way of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is basically very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations allows the awakening of kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment).
Central to Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, in which the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates enlightened consciousness.
Since Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States began to cooperate.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was fought in earnest, through proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was a withdrawal and redeployment to the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops marched in and established the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern Polish regions in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of navies was to ensure that a country maintained the ability to move people and goods while limiting an enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. To help Britain, the Americans tried to bring men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly with U-boats, wanted to stop this traffic.
If the Allied Forces had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain along with the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas and were often tended by goatherds, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herders.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat worse roads of the day.
It was not long before sleepers were used to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that iron bands were more effective.
This became a common practice, but iron made wooden wheels on wagons wear out more quickly.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Characteristics of bipedalism are present in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make our lives more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and deal with it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's wasteful life-style.
After Congress passed it on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by the president of the convention, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printery of John Dunlap a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, known as the "Dunlap Leaflets".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.
Twenty-five of Dunlap's pamphlets still exist and are considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, as the handwritten original has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet birds and dinosaurs share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these two numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always the most obvious, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to preclude an immediate diagnosis.
The main sign of internal poisoning is the possible presence of open containers of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the poison.
Entomologists officially refer to this group of insects as insects.
The term comes from a prehistoric relative of mites, highly evolved human parasites.
Both predatory bedbugs and mites are nesting animals that are adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system - the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that child care is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume the role of the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works using the scientific method, which is actually what drives most scientific research.
But that's not all, an important part of scientific research is also testing, where testing is a test designed to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
In all fields of science, including psychology, Aristotle's views prevailed.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often significantly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation by the biological clock.
Repetitive rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of uninterrupted cyclic repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary greatly, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether progenitor cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, but mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and getting to know orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in their cars to go to work, only to be passed by those working in the town they just left.
In this dynamic mode of transportation, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that had supported human evolution for the last two million years.
In society, everyone participates and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is usually fairly predictable, so traffic flows are predictable and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better illustrate traffic flows, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These ratios help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made them better at avoiding predators and finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are shepherds and mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation of the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon, parts of which are up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on Earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long and is joined by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the period of the New Kingdom, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
In the Vatican, legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language of most workers in the country, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known to man since antiquity because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be mined quite easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
They were more essentially the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he claimed that they changed into new substances and formed what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
We think of elements like calcium and potassium as metals, and, of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that you could fit trillions of them into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil was invented, it was a dear friend to many.
Unfortunately, new methods of writing appeared, and the pencil was pushed into the background.
People now type messages on computer screens and never go near the stylus.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something newer comes along.
The way a fission bomb works is that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Much like pushing a heavy cart down a hill, some of that energy is then released by splitting the core again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they usually decay on their own or with little help.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
There could have been more maria on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava rose to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories explore what makes some people want the things they want and what things in the environment will predispose them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When managers start managing their former colleagues, it is generally considered that they can start behaving in one of two ways: On the one hand, there is an effort to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable for mistakes.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team did and chart his own course.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates a gap between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, however there are small differences.
Virtual group members often act as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They usually have more freedom than ordinary group members, as their groups have to adapt to several time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not listen to.
Another characteristic component of the virtual group is the presence of a real 'invisible group' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
An "invisible team" is a management team to which individual members report.
Why should an organisation go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity can be unleashed when functioning departments of an organization make effective use of available resources.
Thus, in the process of collaboration within the organisation to overcome barriers, a new innovative process may emerge that will meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership needs to establish an innovative environment and foster shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus narrowing the research field and significantly increasing its precision.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the findings of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how processes work in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction overtones, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include supervision, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Those things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they are embedded in many software for personal computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every lesson, and teachers are often happy to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution by providing virtual field trips where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire art right in the classroom.
Posting a field trip report online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capitol, redesign the website every year, but the old versions stay online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can help students improve their writing style. Although most students start a blog with superficial grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students can often be the most demanding audience, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to engage an audience inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Keeping a diary is a tool that encourages students to participate and strive to learn, even when they are not in school.
Appropriate use of online diaries "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can determine their position in relation to the writings of others and form their own views on certain topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasts numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and its hinterland.
All of this and more makes Ontario stand out as distinctly Canadian to foreigners.
Vast areas farther north are quite sparsely populated, and a few areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison may seem surprising to many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of its fauna and flora.
The smaller islands are mostly independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam, which became well established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: We recommend that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (but not one that looks expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give the impression of harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, to be grabbed by the hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and do not be afraid to defend your point of view (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern-day Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
Rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan, the city was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is not difficult to find places selling traditional Moroccan delicacies such as tagines, pottery and leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of geegaws, but these are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated when lava from the Nyiragongo volcano buried most of its streets, especially in the center of the city.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, trips outside Goma need to be explored to understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the best mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by bodo-bodo (motorcycle taxi), which costs about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride at the normal (local) price.
Because it is also quite difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, distant lands.
Despite its fame as a tourist attraction and having an airport, Timbuktu today is an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
This city is quite different from other cities in the country, having more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wildlife and vegetation.
It is one of South Africa's biggest attractions and is considered the showpiece of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in any South African national park, there is a daily entrance fee for conservation and tours.
Perhaps it would be a bad idea to buy Wild Card passes, which grant access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Named after Hong Kong Island, the territory of Hong Kong is a major stop for many tourists.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are linked by a shimmering colonnaded graph emphasized by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
Urban development on Hong Kong's islands is overwhelmingly concentrated in the reunified territory on the north coast.
This town was claimed by the British colonialists, so it's a good starting point to see remnants of the area's colonial past, if you're interested.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by wetlands.
Designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans are now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 cheetahs.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, but most, especially those to the east and Jakkar/Bumthang, from 6.30 to 7.30.
Since long-distance buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket several days in advance.
Most prefectures offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and sturdy.
By sharing taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby towns such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting Oiapoque, Brazil to Saint Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two 3.5 meter wide passages.
The bridge is 15 metres high and was built in August 2011 but only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to become operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní, who lived as fully nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most important indigenous group that inhabited the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes called the "great Indian province", developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
This year's biggest tournament will be held in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be viewed throughout the year.
Tournament news and information on purchasing tickets for polo matches can be found at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley opposite FIC West.
British pounds are accepted on practically all the islands, but credit cards and U.S. dollars are also widely accepted on Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, but British and U.S. currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners as to which method of payment is acceptable.
Falkland currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange cash before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropical zone; summer temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but a mixture of wind and humidity makes it seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park service, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife.
Bison, caribou, moose, bears, and just about any large animal can attack, no matter how tame they seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep their distance.These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook food with a strong odor, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an infamous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All but one of the British cruisers were sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau struggle for independence, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief, Tupue Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland straddles two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie along the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming and are usually planted with New Zealand pohutukawa Christmas trees to provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive waterfront is located in the Waitemata Harbour, a prestigious suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a good selection of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex but a pleasant and refreshing beer.
You can enjoy a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are likely to fare better.
The tap water there is safe to drink, but bottled water is not hard to find if you are afraid.
"Coffee with milk" is a foreign concept to Australians - a short black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with plenty of cream (not frothed milk), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
The reef is a year-round destination for many hikers, and there are few injuries from any of these causes.
Nevertheless, obey the instructions of the authorities, respect all signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Sea wasps come close to beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks are present but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Although saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler ensures that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with certain hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport and even combined air and hotel packages.
They may also hold your reservation if you need to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your final destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any adjustments or preferences should first be communicated to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the middle of the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Although the music on the main stages may be muted, it should be noted that in some festival venues the music may play late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, look where the cabin is, as breaking through the ice makes a rather scary sound for the most sensitive.
Cruises from Saint Petersburg include a stop in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to make their patrons spend as much time and money as possible in them.
They usually offer food, drink, and entertainment to entertain and keep visitors for as long as possible.
In some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price of admission, and drunkenness impairs judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or subfreezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is poor and you cannot drive as you would on unpaved asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow or windblown snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is generally smooth throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The word safari is commonly used to describe a journey overland to see African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars and can be viewed well with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, making them easier to see with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, trekking safari or hiking) is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first being in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus cancellation policies in late March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not already in the room.
If you do not have an iron handy or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the product (which may cause it to shrink or even crack).
There are several methods of treating water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, boiling it for several minutes is necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, buy water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause sensitisation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, release toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between the towns of Point Marion and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it often traverses isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on gravel roads, beware of steep inclines, narrow paths, and sharp turns.
Published speed limits are noticeably lower than in earlier and later installments, typically 35 to 40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, the cell signal is much stronger here than on many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with boiled apples in cakes year-round and cherries and plums in summer.
Most German pastries also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes are usually served with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a pastry that is small but rich, try something called, depending on the region, a Berliner donut, pancake, or doughnut.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is a broad term encompassing a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country of some 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional qualifiers mostly refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors favored by Javanese being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can also be a safety issue as they can trap the rider's legs.
If the horse throws the rider and the rider's foot catches in the stirrups, the horse could drag the rider behind it in case of escape.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a flat, rather narrow heel.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety latches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's leading climbing destination with a variety of large granite walls and caves, called the Yosemite of South America.
Strawberry peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are still carving new paths into its walls of endless potential.
Snow skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a board attached to the foot.
Skiing is a major activity for travelers with a large following, sometimes called "trekking skiers", as they plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called ski touring or ski touring.
Although it does not usually contain elements of these disciplines, it is similar to touring alpine skiing or hiking, which are performed on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good weather, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking - but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and well-maintained trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to apply for several visas and pass through passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area operates more or less like a single country.
Within this area, you can cross borders without having to go through checkpoints again, where you have to show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen Member State separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax agencies define goods as being more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical area, as in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Homemade articles could be classified as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of income for the Sámi and the culture in which it is embedded is also important for other occupations.
Traditionally, however, the Sami did not raise reindeer on a large scale but made their living by fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern industries and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region.
Although the word 'gypsy' is commonly used, especially among the Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel advice, this may affect your health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to ask for advice from a government other than your own, but its advice is designed for its citizens.
For American citizens, the situation in the Middle East, for example, will be different than for Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are only a brief summary of the political situation in each country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalised and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for all hazardous weather phenomena which can cause damage, serious disruption to society or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are many different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Forms and effects of extreme weather include high winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather extremes include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of any extreme weather conditions in the area which may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be viewed as a war zone would do well to obtain professional training.
If you do an Internet search for "hostile environment course", you will likely find the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the problems mentioned here in much greater detail, usually together with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid procedures and occasionally weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are plentiful, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Not all governments are willing to issue passports with an unmarked gender (X) or documents with updated information regarding the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents also varies.
Checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender persons should not expect to survive the examination without invasion of privacy and dignity prior to surgery.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves breaking against the shore, often on reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the reverse current is concentrated in a few deeper sections where a fast downstream current can form.
Most deaths occur from fatigue while swimming upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back won't be any different than normal.
Try to steer somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, wait for rescue.
Return shock occurs earlier than culture shock (not as long as the honeymoon period), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have great difficulty readjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you were first abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, for they knew that travelers need time to adjust to a new country.
Perhaps people do not expect that travelers returning home should also be patient and understanding.
The sound and light show featuring the pyramids is one of the area's most exciting attractions for children.
Before the show begins, you can tour the pyramids in darkness and silence.

The Sphinx is the backdrop and the narrator of the long story.
There are scenes on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, fall under the auspices of several nations and have the most bases, of which 16 were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains converge here to form a plateau, then rise again as the 220-mile-long Ellsworth Range, bisected by a glacier in Minnesota.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 metres.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, you may be able to get help only by using a satellite phone.
A satellite phone cannot usually replace a mobile phone, since you must be outdoors and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
This service is widely used in maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as in missions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telephone service provider can provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
It is particularly popular with final-year students, offering them a year off before starting university without having to sacrifice their education.
It is often the case that education during a year abroad actually increases the likelihood of continuing one's studies in one's home country.
Usually, tuition is required for participation in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating, and the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the offshore islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national sport, with one in seven or eight people owning a boat.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is quite rare elsewhere (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one in 40).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that when visiting the historic city for a few days, you can stay all day and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you go to the mainland only on boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures mention Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience, no matter how old people are or where they come from, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is nothing to be ashamed of, for it is no different from the personal fear and loathing of other things that plague many people.
Understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help some to overcome fear of the unknown or of loss of control.
Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
Larger companies have their own aircraft for some routes, but for other routes and smaller companies there is a problem.
If they send goods by air freight, it may take several days on some routes to clear the goods through customs.
The only way to get them through faster is to send them as checked baggage, and airline regulations prohibit sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to reach deep into your pocket for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
And it doesn't come cheap: you can usually expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy, and 11 times more for first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is also generally pointless to seek discounts for business or first class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău, the official language is Romanian, and Russian is widely spoken.

Most monasteries offer robes to unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will make the monk or nun at the entrance laugh.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed at the entrance, but be aware that they are not washed after each use, so they may not be the most comfortable to wear.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil.

Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
This concept came from China, where Japanese apricots were the most common flower choice.
