Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but it also provides details that are not found so often in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the underside was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as rachis, do not have a well-developed shaft but have other features, such as barbs and barbules.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult, not a juvenile.
The researchers suggested that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage, not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many tiny particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as Earth's large caverns, which tend to maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are very deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet naming the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures quite rigorously.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision following specific procedures.

This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's justice system operates differently, and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control trial were under close supervision of the forest engineers while the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth ZIP code in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay of Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time, which is 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there was no damage reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Then photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although she was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even crazier... I loved her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was put in doubt.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, since these are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at Central Missouri State University, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of distributing water to earth along with the organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let aircraft fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and offer more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the match would have to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can even be rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form a fine thread, and it can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be very thin and glued onto another metal, and because it was so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make a tracer using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and several other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much more numerous small animals such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The revelation to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat does that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
Herds consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and young.
The women are usually closely related, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
Jaguars like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the jaguar hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that jaguars follow and find their prey by scent, sniffing out where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. jaguatiricas hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they inhabited before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics than it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants and we make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we consume is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex would not have been a match for it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called arganaz
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate seated on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
The diet in ancient Rome did not include foods originating in the Americas and Asia into Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the home of their respective gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of these gods by means of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids shaped like towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Much of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open balconies facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled, and in the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie Legend of the Lost Treasure, you might find that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of society.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations.The culture of civilization depends on the passing on of knowledge through different generations, a lasting cultural reach and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on generally uncooperative state officials to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax and tariff laws between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all the states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago".
The founding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named it Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the boundaries of the complex have been reconstructed to offer tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the most common film size in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio between whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much abused and often demoralized rule of thirds is a fairly simple guideline that provides momentum while maintaining relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by its influential force, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies from both military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations and laid out in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of ocean, bringing danger even to neutral-flagged ships.
Germany, since there was limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous employment) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He used to frequent a cave which became known as "Hira'" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious leanings.
Resting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing can be seen but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-pointing arch mark" has its similar appearance with a V, and the "downward-pointing arch mark" has its similar appearance with a clamp or a square without the bottom side.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; bottom means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged eleven, and Louis Charles, aged four), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to fund much of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
It is clear that the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from technology supply or technological imperative to a narrow notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might argue that the automobile necessarily results in improved roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning an automobile.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, meant that citizens were shaped and that, with the passage of time, the customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, because they were in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws eventually mandatory.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that participants of the Crusades returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by the parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection of the child by parts of the parents because of his severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious childhood trauma or abuse before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the private pet, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little clip-on speaker in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalised into the software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that may be challenging for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a myriad of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care and educate, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Foster care is supposed to fill all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are cited as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "relationships with continuity" were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research concluded that there are two kinds of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
On the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
Moreover, failure to act accordingly has serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.
However, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all of this, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" much as modern savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is a process that consists of purposefully waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a half-silent alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while sleeping, it may be placed across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely correlated to their level of bodily and spiritual tension.
Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be backup troop leadership on the battlefields from Africa to Asia to Afghanistan to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic battle of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval organization, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably would have had the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century onwards.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel planks of wood, this allowed horses to pull them to attain greater speeds and to carry larger loads over somewhat rougher roads.
Dormers were implemented early on to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked upright on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
However, if we do not want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and put an end to them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man's overpopulation and extravagant life-style.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a printer, John Dunlap.
During the night about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap raids".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are structured well enough to attach themselves to humans.
Both barbers and bed bugs are nest-builders, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide on a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not at all responses to external periodic stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run for a period of continuous cycle, even without environmental interference.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments that marked either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns in the country to work in other cities, and they meet other people who work in the very small towns they came from.
In this dynamic transportation bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a car-based transportation system.
Science now points out that this carbon-based economy displaced the biosphere from the stable state that had enabled human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because planet Earth doesn't look like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times up to six miles wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water that goes from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It's the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so amazingly small that it would be possible to fit trillions of them into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Today, people type messages on computer screens and do not have to reach for a stylus.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like driving a heavy cart up a hill, the splitting of the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There could be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people possess certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Broadly speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former coworkers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, doing performance reviews, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he must change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of a team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning?
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performances.
Neurobiological data offer physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, therefore narrowing the research area and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves producing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military as it is integrated into various home computer software applications and video games.
Field trips are very important for any school class. Often teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field lessons, where students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Since students often start their blog experience using poor grammar and spelling, then the presence of an audience often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to work on improving his writing and avoiding criticism.
Additionally, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".[1] The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by actively interacting with Internet content, students can place themselves in the context of others' writings as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is farther south; the north has the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
For all of this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited in nature.
For a population comparison that surprises a lot of people, there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations or associated with France and are known for luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which gained great popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of current marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether because of cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the historic Medina, it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a host of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing battle in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands in view of their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In the year 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered world heritage sites because of the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it has more of an Arab than an African feel.
Kruger National Park is in northeastern South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and maintenance of the park, as with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to get a Wild Card, which gives you access to several South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is what many tourists consider its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar graph made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the edge of Kowloon on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is where the British settlers chose to live, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove swath in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coastline of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park
But the forests don't just have mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that once covered the remaining Gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are almost always full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of travelling to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two runways 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to go into operation in September 2017, the expected date for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in retaining many of its characteristics and identity of the indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For updates on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and credit cards and U.S. dollars are accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American coins may be accepted.
It is virtually impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a proper distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, yet avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two inlets.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed by the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops around the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may go down better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Continue to heed official reminders, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is probably possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your booking if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on-site, and most of them consider this a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early so you can camp close to the music.
Be aware that even after the music on the main stages has ended, some sections of the festival may continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include sightseeing in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever driving in high latitudes or on mountain roads, one must take into consideration the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to strand you in no time.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the apple of many visitors' eyes.
The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to overland journeys to observe impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and basic equipment provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Also known as a bushwalk, a walking safari, or a walk, a walking safari is walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be hosted in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for borrowing, even if there is not one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the tissue get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, you may want to consider buying gallons of water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods free of duties and taxes in certain locations.
Travelers who visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, who frequently pass through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be forewarned: Steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The advertised speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict obedience to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria they are as rich and varied as in neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit candies are recurrent, with apples baked in the candy all year round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of plainly seasoned dishes, the predominant spices of Javanese preference being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
For support of a rider's feet, stirrups are used, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety problems as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has had one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal escapes.
First, many riders wear flat-soled, high-heeled riding boots, which are quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
As Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The meetings include breathtaking views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding over snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in the year 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Backpack skiing: also known as backcountry skiing, backpacking skiing or ski mountaineering.
It is related but generally does not involve tourism to alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than on foot - but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.

Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backflow of water from the waves on the beach back to the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it usually would be.
