While an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, so far no drugs have been shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
The antibody mixture ZMapp initially showed promise in this area, but formal studies indicated that it was less effective than expected in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, which means that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee, and accepts the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than decertification.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely held, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a plume, but have other characteristics of feathers - rays and bristles - the researchers deduced that feathers were likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration.
Scientists believe that the tail sample from the juvenile dinosaur shows adult plumage and not chicken down.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in magnetic reversals.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the SagDEG galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy exists around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and there was cause for alarm because of its very high mortality".

"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as steadily as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature around the clock".
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The procedure is very precisely codified in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can see that ballot boxes do not contain ballot papers at the start of voting and that no ballot papers are added other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all stages of the process.

She's in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists need to be careful if they publish pictures of suspects and so on".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the 1967 Six Day War.
Other subjects reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problems of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities agree to leave the valley only for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control experiment had to be closely monitored by park rangers as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, faulty iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Department responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "rather regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who was going to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would speed up the development of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as I was... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the opposite extreme, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He was unable to take the medication needed to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth was formed after comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be deployed and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available at the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, whereas it was thought that this process should have taken much longer because of mating between the endemic Darwin's finch geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes.
It can be pulled out to form a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and put on other metals, and it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then compress them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster methods of transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides react much like wolves or dogs in prides, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, able to climb (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion but is more like a series of snarling, shouted words.
Ozelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population has to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it had previously been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants make oxygen, which humans inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, so even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a vole.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians primarily built a temple, which was viewed as the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no extensive forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled by a few people. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, Inuit tribes were already living in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it is likely that the note was simply an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government -- there are French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France in what was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large, significant group of people who live together and cooperate, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence and equitable sharing.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they depended on state governments, which were often uncooperative in enforcing all acts.
Nor did it have the right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous acceptance by all the states before they could be changed, and the states took so lightly to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national football team, the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an 'archipelago'.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that started a change from the original grain production practices and employed Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which may seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It says that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European nations together despite their different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was being properly carried out.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective in preventing the passage of vital military and civilian supplies, in violation of recognized international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the sea, endangering even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's the attitudes of most citizens and nations leaned toward pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a book of poetry, and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period of time or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same is true of the military, for instead of rank based on class in the army, rank was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up-arcing' mark resembles a V and the 'down-arcing' mark resembles a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes usually produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more forceful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed bow markings are for musical reasons and should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a group of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of screaming people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the Mafia displayed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and the bond interest ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you have to understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that is heritable and not socially determined.
For example, it can be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Increased car ownership also leads to more accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new techniques in the medical field to heal injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography arose, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, largely because Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices of greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to simply meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
Individuals belonging to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through failure, accident or deliberate neglect, have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Some feral children have been deprived of their liberty by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this deprivation was caused by parental rejection of a child with serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others claim to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviours (within physical limits) that are almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn something new - for example, how to use a new computer programme or how to start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised into the software and aims to question, request and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family's job is to provide all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to content.
For example, it is suggested that 'learning' and 'socialising' are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two distinct pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added by mutation and removed from the pool of exact variation by selection".
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of noncompliance: stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant sources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn the clock off while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is directly opposite to the amount of tension a person has in body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force.
Anyone can learn to understand, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy is awakened to life (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while affecting your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often supervised by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, equivalent to the more commonly known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Sleepers were invented quite early to hold the tracks in place, but eventually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of metal were used.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning erect man).
Their Australopithecus ancestors did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2 to 3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's extravagant life-style.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by President of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his soldiers in New York.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits, or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, insects that are highly parasitic on humans.
Both predatory mites and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning that they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method.
However, it doesn't stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they tagged either the DNA in the beaker with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the beaker with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape and the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks as well as studies of ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system that is based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has released the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human evolution for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help in planning, designing and operating road systems.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the mayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Opinions were divided - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
Well, that makes sense, because we can't feel the Earth spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, in places up to six miles (9.6 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical excellence of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
That's why the pencil was such a good friend to most people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less and less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now type messages through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to collapse under little or no stress.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the front and 100 kilometers thick on the back.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what makes people respond or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
The theories investigate what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behaviour can arise when a manager starts to manage his former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behaviour often results in problems between managers and the rest of the team.
The same expectations of expertise are placed on virtual teams as on conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organisation's functional departments.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers need to create a culture that fosters innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us lots of information and materials to build simulation models with that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although often associated with science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been embedded in several home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class. Quite often a teacher would love to take their students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions: pupils can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good way to evaluate a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills.Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become smarter about the world around them". The demand to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to Muskoka and other areas of unspoiled natural beauty.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered by outsiders to be truly Canadian.
Further north, there are vast areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which spread rapidly to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what looks like a wedding ring (it just should not look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a variety of knick-knacks, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, just east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
It is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Coupled with the city's relative inaccessibility, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
In sharp contrast with the rest of the country, it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees to the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the primary focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings that, when reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a shimmering bar graph.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water bodies.
Established as a game reserve in 1966, the Sundarbans is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 white-tailed deer.
Buses run from the inter-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses that are both comfortable and sturdy.
Delta taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also did subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of India", came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadores and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets, contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is fixed at the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted within Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners to see what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months temperatures often exceed 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bears, and just about any large animal can attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the town that resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are found on the Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of seaside shops.
The most widespread local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It's perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
To Australians the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called an "espresso", a cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of authorities, read and follow signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should first be addressed to the tour operator and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and many attendees consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
Check where your cabin is if you are crossing the Baltic in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions), which is good to know, as cruises to St Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos make every effort to keep patrons spending as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and in the house.
But drunkenness impairs judgment, and all genuine gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who must drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and slippery roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, icy and slippery conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows largely unimpeded year-round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and perhaps the biggest draw for tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to overland journeys to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to see them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "walking safari") consists of hikes that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed even if there is none in the room.
If you cannot use an iron or do not like wearing socks that have been ironed, try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in extreme cases, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases per se, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often traversing isolated backcountry terrain.
Be careful if you are not used to driving on country roads: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp curves abound.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than before and after - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them exactly.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are as tasty and varied as in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and flowers make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you fancy some small but filling pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries, while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualification, the term typically refers to the food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a variety of single-seasoned dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Footrests are supports for the rider's feet that hang down either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet becoming trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be pulled along if the horse runs away.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Second, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that release the stirrup straps from the saddle if they are pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, features a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountaintops present absolutely breathtaking views from the summits for all visitors.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve driving down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" - planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C. show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
I want you to see the skirt as if it were a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk - but you will rarely reach the same speed as if you were cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport control several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area operates more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques; some tax authorities define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many Sami with other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived from fishing, hunting and the like and mainly used the reindeer as draught animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi.
Although the word "Gypsy" is often used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel advice arises in the country you are visiting, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The consultations are only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often vague, general and simplistic in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for all hazardous weather phenomena which can cause damage or serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur all over the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area, as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training" is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role play, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but few publications deal with war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documentation for the return journey.
Governments' willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security searches have also become more intrusive in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not undergone surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and a fast flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it's no harder than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes more quickly than culture shock (there is not as much of a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, realizing that adjusting to a new country requires effort.
People do not necessarily expect patience and understanding when travellers return home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting activities for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors, but the story of the sound and the light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet on the high plateau to form the 225-mile-long (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), with a peak of 16,028 feet [4,892 m].
In remote areas without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, since you must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among school leavers as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place on a higher education course in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for sailors. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and archipelagos along its coast.
In the oceans and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, a smaller boat or even a kayak offers a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for a couple of full days, returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or lack of control.
Freight forwarders charge good money to deliver quickly, and time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent items by air freight, some routes may have taken days to clear loading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
In general, there is no need to look for discounts at all on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting there quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member states.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, bustling commercial city situated on a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs, the old 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some tombstones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around this fascinating village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous among foreigners by a glowing account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated through an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, to behave as one who is "bien élevé".
The cool exterior of Parisians evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forests - mainly beech and conifers - with a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities because of its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, you will find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and bull.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries have scarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover the knees.
These can be borrowed from the storeroom at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel entirely comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a lot of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accompaniments such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar book will help you to learn much about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it'll be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know some Spanish, however, may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where flowers from flowering trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to "take just one sample".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But when you are in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less often).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are considering enters Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise from an exposed location.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian springtime and fertility rite.
The more traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, when congregations often break out in celebration at midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazer in the Galapagos.
Since the first humans arrived in Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see auroras, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address one another by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important and thus emphasizes group effort rather than praise of individual performance.
Workers often need their supervisor's approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their supervisor's instructions without question.
