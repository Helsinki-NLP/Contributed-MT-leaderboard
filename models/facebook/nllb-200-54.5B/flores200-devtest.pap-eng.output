This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a well-established theory, but also that fossils in general could not represent detailed, three-dimensional colors and patterns.
Scientists describe the animal's plumage as brownish above and lighter orange or yellow below.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers near birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other feather features - barbs and barbules - the researcher deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not in use during flight but rather for temperature regulation or for deployment.The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a well feather.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult feathers and not a well feather.
A car bomb targeting the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey early yesterday killed two police officers and wounded more than twenty others.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant of responsibility for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system was found to be governed by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation together are used to determine a star's number according to Rossby theory, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is related to magnetic reversal.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and our galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, so our galaxy exerts a force on the Milky Way.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way to regular matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter located around a galaxy is trapped in a halo around the galaxy, and is made up of various small particles.

Pigs carry the disease, which is then transmitted to humans through blood.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as mandating pig slaughter in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets and spraying pesticides.
The government also pledged several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver the vaccines to the historically hardest-hit areas this year have been delayed by a lack of funding and low priority compared to other diseases.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle, place a printed piece of paper with their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After employees verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in a box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law codifies the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes enter that are not those of the correctly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend all stages of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

The Crown Office, which is fully in charge of prosecutions, indicated to reporters that it would not comment further on the allegations.
The document, according to the reading, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
Rangers had to supervise shooters in the supplementary case of pest control closely, as well as monitor the case in court and evaluate its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Shooting Sport Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Shooting Sport Association's yacht program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Deputy Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NWPS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the withdrawal of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
Over 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with severe burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company declared "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer holds Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six people are now confirmed dead.
They released six hostages early, including children, the elderly and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then impersonated an elderly man going to the bathroom and shot Mendoza dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the development of a baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Her fellow wrestlers also came to honor Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the second moon. Quite unique, just like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as I was...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her health was called into question due to her complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to treat his pain because it was forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using different hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets could have been a source of Earth's water supply along with organic material that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, from the time of cometary impacts long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and slander".
There is speculation that he will try to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims could allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint an aircraft's position more precisely and give pilots more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport running and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities will not be available at the site.
Fears of a lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes.
It can be shaped into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be beaten with a hammer or rolled in a thin sheet.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handwritten plates in illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red juice.
Colored juices change color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry ingredients, and then press them together with clean, damp hands to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman times they were often part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere warps some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has done for us is give us easier and faster transportation.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and bees.
Finally there are many small felines (including domestic cats) that eat small prey of much larger numbers such as insects, especially mice, beetles and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat has to do so that it does not compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty lionesses and cubs.
The females are usually closely related, being an extended family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like wolf or dog prides, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
An athletic tiger can climb (not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full voice, but more like a phrase of roaring and shouting.
They like to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the animals they eat are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find prey by scent, sniffing out where they have been underground.
They have excellent night vision and are very stealthy. Ocelots hunt by hiding in the shadows of their prey.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) finds itself separated from the parent population from which it came (such as if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island in a way from which it cannot easily return) it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different sources of support and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from wood and our clothes from wood. Most of the food we eat comes from wood. Without wood, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the fiercest animal of its time, but it was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Its long fangs are filled with over 70 sharp, needlelike teeth, with seven more in its upper jaw, meaning that nothing can escape its clutches.
We cannot be sure, but it probably had a forked tongue, ate squid, large fish, most types of mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't keep up with it.
While most of their foods may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or exceptionally tasty foods, including wild boar, poultry, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on couches, the rich men liked to have their banquets together lying on their laps while they ate their meals.
The ancient Roman diet could not have contained foods that entered Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not grow corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or coconuts, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians considered each of their gods to be a greater temple than the house of that god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to supply the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
No one entered the inner courtyard except the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not of great importance.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in courtyards, the kitchen was simply an open hearth overlooking the street, and houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and on his journey west, he came to Greenland and named it Grønland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each nation was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kingdoms, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there was writing on the back of the document, it was not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears below the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the relatively large document (it measured 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was looted in order to preserve it.
So the note was probably added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
Some had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than fight against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also variously defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and an equitable distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, depended on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement all its laws.
It also had no authority to override fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the federal government seriously when their representatives were regularly absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the Germany national football team, the world's second most successful national football team and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the world's seventh-largest island!
Because of Japan's cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native wheat production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been reconstructed and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the sensor format of digital cameras has inherited its aspect ratio.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to find the easiest ratio of a whole number) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (APS format family, for example) are the same or nearly the same in aspect ratio approximately.
Often abused and frequently ridiculed, the rule of thirds is simply a guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most efficient placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under critical scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the major Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been established in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether it was compatible with basic principles.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, endangering even some neutral shipping.
Because there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations were eager to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
She arrived in the United States with four cents to her name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (her former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or ruling dynasty had a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period of divided provinces, the best known of which is the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods fierce struggles took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history as thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution the vacancies were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military because instead of ranking in the army based on class they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people or countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He frequently visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a hilltop to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you knew it existed. Once in the cave, it's total isolation.
The sky, once so bright and beautiful, was no longer visible. The earth, once so full of God's glory, was no longer visible.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" looks like a V and the "down arrow" looks like a knot or a rectangle without its bottom edge.
Top means that you should start at the tip and press the bow, and bottom means that you should start at the handle (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke generally creates a softer sound, while a downstroke is harder and louder.
Feel free to write in your own notes, but remember that printed bookmarks are there for a musical purpose, so they should generally be respected.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of women merchants.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and uttering threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their open carriage windows.
At one point a member of the crowd shook the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenses of the war of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, to finance a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking companies.
Naturally, the profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would form the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Medieval Period was preceded by the Early High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely determined by cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods must be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more car accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of determination, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the position of society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Capital of Fashion took place from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style became very popular in the period between the 10th - 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication of the canals, the fashion in the west is 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the period being the widespread use of buttons as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native seeds saved from the ecosystem in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture's distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic form of stylistic usage, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to make use of the unfortunate few cases of children who, due to neglect, misbehavior, or intentional abuse, failed to be socialized by adults as they were growing up.
Some deaf children were kept at home by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of these children was due to parental rejection because of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Unaccompanied children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were supposedly raised by animals; some were said to live in the wild by themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, deaf children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost completely like those of the particular animals that raised them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new experience of learning how to use a new computer program or start with a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a lecturer is a kind of support but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized into the software and has the goal of questioning, motivating, and explaining the procedures that may be present as a challenge for the student to act on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and educational, but it happens.
We find that the foster family system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Stepfamilies must provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were displaced.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of focus of use and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivational aspects of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement"" and ""continuous engagement"" are also aspects of new motivation that Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has brought important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that can last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his documentary The President's Speech, points out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless understand sincerity adequately.
It has even been suggested that such skills as interpreting human behavior could be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resource would be the proteins available in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, horse, rabbit) are not only easy to digest, but they provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" the way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely from sleep.
If you find yourself putting your bedsheets on again in your dream, you can put the bedsheets on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to pay.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, they are known to stimulate urination) before going to bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is presented. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and enlightenment of consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war the conflict of systems, processes and culture led to the end of cooperation between the countries.
Within two years of the war's end, the former Allies had become bitter enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in real battles, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and their only hope was to withdraw and regroup with the Romanian fortifications.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is one of the most efficient ways to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats appears to have begun in the Zagros Mountains of Iran approximately 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or grassy areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or adolescents, comparable to the more widely known shepherd.
From the 16th century, horse-drawn trams were built in England.
Although horse-drawn trams barely consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn vehicles to reach higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Cross-connecting rails were introduced quickly enough to hold the rails in place; however, it was gradually realized that rails could be more efficient if they had an iron spike on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and the first iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, with humans walking on two legs approximately two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright regularly.
In Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, bipedal specializations have been found although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we must go to the root of the problems, and we must deactivate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and man's extravagant life-style.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten proclamation signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press just a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the Dunlap Broadsides, were printed overnight.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them para.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still dinosaur-like.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay webs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and in computer terminology these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that no immediate diagnosis can be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the old knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that are well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and bed bugs are long-lived where they are born, adapted to life in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
Such couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The ultimate goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, and it is this method that guides most scientific research.
However it is not only through experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific investigations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological processes.
For most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues.
Biological cues are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external cues, will continue to work for a period in free-running cycles.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages (small viruses that infect bacteria), or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments by marking either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals in the wild.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns by car to go to work while others whose work destination is the place they just left pass them by.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a family car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that had sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented roughly.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators faster, find food, and reproduce more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a wider range to hide in smaller places from their natural enemies.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are moths and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many thought the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest and largest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's longest river, at over six hundred miles long.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most civil servants, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since antiquity, as they are found in nature in native forms and are relatively easy to obtain with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, as are metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that bions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The butcher was a good friend of many people when he came out, so.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing appeared, cuneiform was degraded to a lesser status and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a sleeper.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom works on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like riding a heavy cart up a hill, spinning the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to break apart with little or no pushing.
The Moon's surface is composed of rock and dust.
The waterfall is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria (dark-colored rocks on the Moon) and thicker below the more mountainous parts.
There may have been more marl on the near side because the shell was thinner; it was easier to wash the king up to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and become adults.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to desire the things they do and what it is about their environment that causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is about becoming "one of them".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, executing disciplinary actions, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable for harm.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the team has been doing and do it his way.
After all, the leader is the one who ultimately is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their team can meet according to different time zones that their local management team may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can manifest.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead them to a new process of innovation to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thereby narrowing the field of investigation and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior sustains scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and probe the structure and processes of the brain like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction implications, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries as well as recognize handwritten letters, voices, and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Al systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military service, and several home computer and video game software applications have also been built.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom, and often a teacher wants to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, redesigning the website each year but keeping old versions online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling intact, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make efforts to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging "forces students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writing as well as delineate their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's delightful bilingual capital and features a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario stand out as, what outsiders consider, distinctively Canadian.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited worlds.
For a startling population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the other islands, and it is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, which took major forms in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bordered by the Sabel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but one that does not look too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they may perceive as harassment and it is not uncommon for them to follow you, hug you, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century CE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there renamed it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajine, ceramics, leather goods, hookah and a range of geegaws, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the streets of the city, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for trekking up the Nyiragongo volcano with some of the cheapest treks to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda boda (broom taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World special on PBS.
The city is in notable contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is regarded as the most important of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees to the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card", which provides admission to either a selection of South African parks or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is where many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a bright bar graph made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head in the opposite direction of the Kowloon peninsula.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's longest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The jungles, however, are not just swamps of palms and mangroves - they contain some of the last remaining supports of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic area.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted hyenas in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06.30 and 07.30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the prefectures are serviced by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and powerful minibuses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the West Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain many aspects of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley as well.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owner of the establishment as to which form of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) are normal.
Winters can be disappointingly cool: temperatures exceptionally drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "young" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or restrained.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from boars and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife!
Despite how tame they may seem, bison, elk, deer, wild boar, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that odors attract deer and other wildlife, so avoid cooking with strong odors and keep campsites clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the harbor.
Almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the death of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi lll.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is divided into two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
Beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to nearby Devonport in the south.
Nearly all have sandy beaches and are safe for swimming, and most have shade from the pohutukawa tree.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, which is in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a variety of shallow pools along the shore.
The main local soup is 'Number One', not a complex soup, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines will be better on the trip.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
For Australians, the concept of a flat white is foreign: a short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with a cream filling (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many reef excursions take place every year, and injuries caused by any of these on the reef are very few.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, heed all posted signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box-shaped water droplets are present near beaches and near river mouths from October to April in the northern 1770s. Occasionally they may be present outside these seasons.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean, their primary habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance eliminates the traveler's concern about having a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, however you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or you have to take care of other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agency first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, arrive early to get a spot near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have ended, there are other sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the direction of your cabin, as the passage through the ice can cause horrible blisters for the most traumatized.
Cruise travel to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their guests.
They usually have special foods, lifestyles, and entertainment to keep their guests well fed and entertained.
Although some establishments do serve alcoholic beverages free of charge, the excessive consumption of alcohol destroys good judgment, and all conscientious gamblers know the importance of being cautious.
Anyone who plans to drive at high altitudes or to drive on mountain roads must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low and you cannot drive as well as you can on unpaved asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall to trap you in no time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic moves almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are probably the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the great African wilderness, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment provides good vision.
Lions, leopards, and panthers are sometimes shy and you will see them better in person.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk", "hinking safari", or simply "footing") consists of walking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of last March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, the date the Olympics were rescheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for rent, even if there is no one present in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you prefer not to iron your socks, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to crack or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in a worst-case scenario cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, do not normally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise in certain locations.
Travel to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont contains the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated and remote wilderness terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, take it easy: perpendicular climbs, narrow paths, and steep inclines dominate.
Speed limit signs are obviously lower than in the previous and following sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than in other cases.
Remarkably, however, cell phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, very rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked in the pastry all year round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry may be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior or northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the sub-continent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a very wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further specification, the term tends to refer to the cuisine originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Today widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of simply seasoned dishes, the dominant flavors being Javanese favourites such as spices, pepper, juice (especially Javanese coconut juice) and various aromatic spices.
Stripes are supporting the runner's legs that hang on either side of the seat.
They provide greater stability for the runner but may have some safety aspects due to the possibility of a runner's foot getting caught in them.
If a runner is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, the runner must wear riding boots that have a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Furthermore, some harnesses, particularly English harnesses, have safety rails that allow the horsehair to fall out of the harness if pulled back by a harness remover.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and large canyons.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between the infinite potential of the walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport involving sliding down a snow-covered slope on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many fans, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning complete skiing holidays in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings show skiing dating back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Backcountry skiing is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not include the styles of alpine skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering, the latter being done on perpendicular terrain and requiring skis and stiffer footwear.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you can cover somewhat greater distances than walking - but only rarely will you reach the speeds of cross country skiing without a heavy load on the prepared routes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to apply for visas and pass through passport control several times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions like a country in this respect.
While you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for the other Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that describes what manufactured items are antique; some tax agencies define merchandise more than 100 years old as antique.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Fish products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar products that have been mass-produced.
Beekeeping is an important part of Sámi life and culture and related trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, although not all Sámi were involved in large-scale cattle breeding, they lived from fishing, hunting and similar, cattle breeding mostly as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern commerce and tourism is an important source of income for the Sámi people.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misperceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are going to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, whose advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Announcements are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoints presented are often crude, general and highly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any weather hazard phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of severe weather, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe storm.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather affecting their area as this may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone would need professional training.
An internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will probably give you the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all of the issues discussed in much greater detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will usually be 2-5 days long and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not specified (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies widely.
Searches at security checkpoints became much more intensive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people undergoing surgery should not expect to go through the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that have broken on a beach, often at a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated to a few deeper sections, and a strong deep water current can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to focus on a path that does not take you back into the current or, depending on your abilities and whether you are spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Rebound shock affects you more quickly than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adjusted to a new culture easily sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your own cultural habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely understanding and patient with you, realizing that adjusting to a new country requires effort.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the highlights of the children's area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Most of the time, you'll hear the sound of tourists and vendors selling things.
The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
It shows the scenes on the pyramids and lights up the different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the Peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula join the plateau, then join again to form the 225-mile (360 km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, with the summit Mount Vinson at 4,892 metres (16,000 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cellular phone, because you must be outside with a direct line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
Ship navigation frequently uses this service, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions requiring long-distance voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with school leavers, giving them a year off before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can really increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return home.
Typically, there will be a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for surfing. The "land of a thousand lakes" also consists of thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough to offer a different experience for any yacht, smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This figure is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but unique in its own right (e.g. in the Netherlands the figures are one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruisers have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning in the evening and sleeping on the boat.
If you only disembark using the ship's own excursion you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises mention Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and dislike of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver items quickly. Time is often of the essence with business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If cargo was shipped by air, some routes could take days to clear customs.
The only way to pass it faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send baggage without passengers, so here your part begins.
The conventional way to fly first class or business class is to charge a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your airline do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a rule you can expect to pay up to four times the normal amount for economy to business and eleven times for first class!
It generally does not make sense to seek discounts for business- or first-class seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a group of travelers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of a fast and comfortable ride, so they charge exorbitantly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul and a major transportation hub.
Once the old city of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, built around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers feature traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting sculptures of marble doves on some tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour in the fascinating village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, made famous abroad by Lord Byron's glowing account of its splendors.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Santuario de la Virgen de Fátima), a world-famous site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, and also a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and women survived that time, and many more had loved ones who were killed or enslaved to death, both Jews and Gentiles.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because by law it is established as the first official language.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements are made on the Metro only in Catalan, but unplanned interference is announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, insolent, and arrogant.
Although often this is just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still to behave excellently, to behave like a person who is "bien élevé" (well brought up).
The Parisian's gruff exterior will quickly evaporate if you demonstrate some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested with beech and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its scale of microclimates, different soil types and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, zebra, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear a veil that covers their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries offer veils for unprepared women, but if you bring one of your own, especially a brightly colored one, you will get a smile from the monk or a hug at the entrance.
In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
You can also hang these from the drawer at the entrance but don't wash those clothes after each use so you may not feel comfortable wearing these sheets.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean area, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple and popular meal, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available food such as cheese, fresh fish, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It undoubtedly makes reading easier, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is being used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Also note that r and rr are pronounced differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar introduction will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are often located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where primroses were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in natural settings, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one".
If you visit a formally equipped garden, if you collect "specimens" you are also thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live and very easy to get around and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But because it is located in the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator you have to deal with both heat (always) and bright sunshine (when the sky is clear, less common).
Some buses also go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check to see if the bus you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Small seas can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube or sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes that are popular for walking or cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the customs surrounding Christmas have also been adopted by unbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night lying in a place exposed to the rising sun.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, where congregations often begin celebrations at 12 midnight to commemorate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland mammals could not make the journey and so the giant tortoise became the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, yaks, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for about 24 hours a day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is usually not a problem, so you can enjoy the stars too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Flip flops are worn as standard professional attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony at work is crucial, emphasizing group effort over praising individual achievement.
Employees often have to get approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
