USA Gymnastics supports the note from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of the athletes, the clubs and their sports, can be served more appropriately if we move forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than the withdrawal of certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of proportion that Larry Nassa's survivors so courageously described could have gone unseen for so long and welcomes any changes that are necessary and appropriate.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 election. He subsequently served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, following Henry Kissinger.
As national security adviser, he assisted Carter in the diplomatic handling of international affairs, such as the 1978 Camp David Accords, the normalization of relations between the United States and China in the late 1970s, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which led to a hostage crisis in Iran, and the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, an already widespread theory, it also provides specific data that fossils usually do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a brown upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid underparts.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage does not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but does have other features of feathers (pig and barbules), the researchers concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight but to regulate or indicate temperature. The researchers say that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the feathers are those of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts appreciated that even though the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrated the plumage of an adult rather than that of a chick.

The sun was found to be governed by the same basic principles as other stars - the only factors driving its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
The light intensity and rotation are combined to calculate a star's Rossby number, linked to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star in relation to its magnetic reversals.

He did not mention a figure for the cuts and said they would be based on China's economic output.
Hu encouraged developing states to "not go back to the traditional path of polluting first and cleaning up later".
He added: 'However, it is not right to ask them to take on obligations which are beyond their stage of development, their level of responsibility and their capacities.'
The Iraq Study Group released its report today at 12:00 GMT.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any Iraqi action at this point will stop sectarian strife, escalating violence or a slide towards chaos.
The report opens with a call for open debate and consensus building in the United States about Middle East policies.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive in Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, number one of which is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year to protect Iraq's borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic ties with its neighbours.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is currently a senator and the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for the presidency.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she started her campaign for the senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that gave rise to the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget for post-Katrina relief and reconstruction, a measure that some fiscal conservatives jokingly labeled the "Bush New Orleans Deal".

The water flows over the levee in a stretch that is 100 feet wide.
Adam Cuerden, administrator of Commons, expressed his frustration over the deletions in a statement he made to Wikinwes last month.
"Essentially, he [Wales] lied to us from the beginning, on the one hand pretending that he was doing it for legal reasons, on the other pretending to pay attention to us until he removed the artistic content".
The community's anger led to current efforts to draft a policy on sexual content on the site, which hosts millions of openly licensed media.
Although the work was mainly theoretical, the programme was designed to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes tides.
Experts concluded that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.
Television footage shows white smoke billowing from the plant.
The local government warns those residing in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors, keep air conditioners turned off and not to consume tap water.

Authorities speculate that containers of uranium fuel at the site may have ruptured and leaked.
Extremely resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant was causing "a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of those infected were health care workers at the hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the proportion of XDR-TB in the total TB population still appears to be small: 6 000 out of 333 000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

There they discovered the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian, covered in blood-stained blankets.
Police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease during this season were recorded towards the end of July.
Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans via mosquitoes.
The outbreak has prompted the Indian authorities to deploy pig hunters, distribute thousands of mosquito nets and use pesticides in the worst-affected areas.
The authorities have also guaranteed several million vials of the vaccine to fight encephalitis, which will allow health companies to prepare for next year.
This year, the scarcity of monetary resources and low prioritization, compared to other diseases, have caused delays in the implementation of vaccine delivery plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where, after three years, she got a job at the Swedish post office and there became Chief engraver.
The number of stamps he made, both for Sweden and for 28 other nations, exceeds a thousand units.

With the construction of the dam in 1963, seasonal flooding that left sediment along the river was halted.
This sediment was necessary for the formation of sandbanks and beaches, which, in turn, functioned as habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two others are endangered, including the gila cypha.
While the water level will only rise a few feet past flood stage, officials hope it will be enough to repair deteriorating sandbars downstream.

As seen in the infrared images, the temperature variations during the night and day indicate that these are probably caves.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface, and at night it is warmer.
"While their thermal behavior is not as regular as large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the archaeology team from the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and insert into an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, he or she puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law lays down the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of those voting, duly computed and authorized.
Candidates are empowered to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process, and during the night volunteers tally the votes under close supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The first was the slalom, in which he earned a "Not Finished First Race", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she placed tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind first-place finisher Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers in the seated category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants out of 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the home at the time of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh County Court, charged with her son's murder.
While she is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, any eyewitness statement may be questionable as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but because Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: "Journalists seem to be treading on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is issued.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the boundaries in place prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics also reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the shooters had to be closely supervised by the rangers as the shooters were monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In a union between NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited within the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage office of the NPWS Park, noted that comprehensive training in safety and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
In four years, this is Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous CEP resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's way of responding to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the fact that no elections have been held, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company categorized as "non-serious".
The ministry commented on the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 am local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage nationwide.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus and held hostage tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 on the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six are confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and went to work for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began her research on preterm birth in her spare time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of the Far Side. She died on the night of the two moons, unique, like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Gold of Powder Runnels stated, "Luna was as weird as I was; even, even weirder. I love her and will miss her. I hope she's in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, there has been an 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's term ended.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At one extreme of the poll are 29 percent who feel that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other extreme are 31 percent who feel that it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He has been unable to take pain-relieving drugs because they are banned from use in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the finding by using various types of hardware and software in early February and it was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as of organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists expect to understand how planets, particularly our own, originate, given that comets crashed into Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would shorten flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to concern over possible transportation issues, the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the journal Science published research reporting on the appearance of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, report that the new species evolved in just two generations - much longer than previously thought - by breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migrating cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all sorts of shapes and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it used to be used to decorate handmade illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the test chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron, so a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake the two dry powders together and squeeze them into a ball with clean, moist hands.
There will be a reaction between the moisture on your hands and your outer layers, which will feel foreign to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the light from Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light we see.
It takes a giant rocket, more than 100 feet high, to get a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, but the most important thing it's done for us is give us much simpler, faster transportation.
Thanks to it, we now have many means of transportation, such as railways, automobiles, and many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized cats that feed on medium-size prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
Herds are made up of one to three adult males from the same family group, joined by up to thirty females and their young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like wolves or dogs, with which they bear a striking resemblance (unlike the other big cats) both in their behavior and in being highly lethal to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make long jumps, and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but, rather, like a prayer of words spoken in growls and cries.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. Where possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
Not only do ocelots have excellent night vision and stealth, but they hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they came (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the fledgling population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will be impossible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing except its own kind.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth embedded in them, plus an additional set in the roof of the mouth, which meant that whatever passed in front of it had nowhere to go.
His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water - not even a dinosaur as huge as T. rex was a threat to it.
While most of these foods would be quite familiar to us today, the Romans also feasted on such unusual items as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that humble people and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while eating.
It is unlikely that ancient Roman recipes included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central temple as their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests attended to the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Occasionally, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to their deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
Hebrew families spent much of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey he undertook farther west, discovered the island and gave it his name.
Despite its discovery, however, Eskimo tribes inhabited the area at that time.
Although each separate country was 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the huge parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
It is therefore likely that the annotation was added merely as a label.
Although the D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, the southern part still remained.
Its government was in the hands of the "Vichy" French, who were a group who, in 1940, had made peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which an extended group of people living and working together is a part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related both to the word civis, from the same language, meaning citizen, and to civitas, whose meaning is city or city-state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization culture entails a prolonged generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to tax, and since there was a national executive or judicial branch, that function fell to state governments, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
Nor was it empowered to nullify tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states paid so little attention to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomeration/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
The establishment in 1624 of a base in southwest Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter as a province dependent on the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War, (1894-1895), the Qing government adheres to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it cedes the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retains its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can visualize what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the work continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format globally is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the analogue film era.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly its dimensional ratio was moved to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the dimensional ratio of this format (divide by twelve to calculate the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigraphy, the APS format group) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
Often ridiculed and mocked, the rule of thirds is a simple rule that adds dynamism and order to images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite European states despite their different languages and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the monarch to the common man.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are set aside for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated widely recognized international law and international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain drew entire sections of the ocean into international waters to block shipping, endangering even neutral vessels.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany expected to meet a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to prevent such things from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States in order to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation note made by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time, with each stage or ruling family constituting a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The best known was the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Han dynasty and the Jin.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are many, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since, instead of army ranks being based on classes, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other repressed working class people in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, vividly illustrates Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
On the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave completely cut off from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if you were sure of its existence.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains around. From inside this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of many pyramid-shaped structures of great size built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other such tombs and smaller temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The 'arch up' mark resembles a V and the 'arch down' mark is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is louder and sharper.
Feel free to make your own marks in pencil, but do not forget that marks on stringed instruments have been placed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged eleven, and Louis Charles, aged four), and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to throw open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of an executed royal guard at Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that floated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
The super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would already constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The period of European history in which these events took place is usually known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a narrow sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the fate of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds by a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of vehicle ownership.
The massive use of cars also generates a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very much present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered the city of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 B.C. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century, their status declined, largely because returning crusaders brought gifts of silks and spices that were valued more highly than goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was thereafter transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The culmination of the Gothic style took place in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own, and one of the most significant developments of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming where the aim is to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds native to the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and gives them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
Traits that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographic, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to display traits of their subculture through distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures, and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growing up.
Some feral children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, a child's abandonment is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered traumatic experiences or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the feral child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it exhibits behaviours (within its physical possibilities) almost entirely equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those going through a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; to put it another way, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the little animated Microsoft Office clipboard.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the learner alone.
Children are taken into care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education, but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The purpose of foster care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the previous foster home.
The Internet combines and mixes components of mass and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of users' reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), 'personal involvement' and 'lasting relationships' were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless assess sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that the abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one and the other generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of humans, to meet its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources.
In fact, failure to do so leads to serious problems - stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the easiest plant resources to access, but they're not easily digestible for primates like us, unless you cook them.
On the other hand, food derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In short, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their 'protein problems' in the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a more or less gentle alarm clock that brings him back to a conscious state, though not fully awake.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on circadian rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force we have, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and joy.
The only thing standing in the way is our own tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of the Buddha, they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and numerous yoga techniques from India.
Generally speaking, secularism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels can be cleared, chakras activated, and enlightened consciousness developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and be fought for real, through proxy militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army fighters from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the Navy has always been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this, with the Americans attempting to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
In order to obtain their milk, hair, meat, and leather easily, ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually herded together in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more popular goatherd.
In England, railways had been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the chariot rails were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
The use of sleepers to hold the rails in place began quite early, but gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron on top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 solid iron rails began to be used.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, were not in the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more planet-friendly lives, become part of environmental movements, or we can even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, asymptomatic treatment, but if we are not just looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has undergone great changes as a result of mankind's technological and scientific advances, and the problems have been intensified by overpopulation and extravagant life-styles.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who first read the document, and he did so in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9.
Dunlap's 25 photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
A lot of paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed extremities, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs just like T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of manipulating data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be encountering an open bottle of medicine or toxic chemical cleaners.
Read the label for specific first aid information relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-dwelling; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
There are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the junction of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that a different partner can take care of the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to decipher how the world works by means of the scientific method, which guides most scientific inquiry.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers turned to the classics, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially on questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour are often critically dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in nearly all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a free cyclic operating period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism typically attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife.
Some examples of possible activities at the site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Today, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has robbed the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it's rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to such complaints and why failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study traffic flow, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to behave relatively consistently, which allows traffic flows to be logically consistent and roughly mathematically represented.
In order to plot the flow of traffic more clearly, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design as well as the operations of road devices.
The first species to take flight were insects, which helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, gluing them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings are mayflies and mayflies.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system orbited the earth, including the sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since you can't feel it moving on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on earth, containing eight times as much water as the next largest river.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, up to six miles wide in places.
Of all the water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never surpass those of Giza, either in size or in the sublimity of their building technique.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time dated back more than a millennium.
With about 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken on a daily basis by the majority of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (in identical order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, except that, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
It is also possible that alloys exist with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
So when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, following the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people type messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
Similar to what happens when you roll a heavy car up a hill, splitting the nucleus once again releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no pushing.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two types of behaviour can occur when managers begin to lead their former colleagues.
Managers in this category find it difficult to make decisions that displease employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibilities, and hold staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to modify everything the group has been doing so far and do it his way.
At the end of the day, the person ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure is the leader.
This kind of behavior often ends up distancing leaders from other team members.
The same standards of excellence that drive conventional teams apply to virtual ones, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than members of a traditional group because it is possible for their teams to meet in different time zones which, for example, might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also unique to virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports.
What motive might an organization have to undergo the demanding process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organisation, there is room for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible for the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty to result in a new innovative process in order to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is contributing to scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models, which further our understanding about mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important specialty within computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include, but are not limited to, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer inquiries, as well as facial, handwriting, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors, just as it was incorporated into various video game and personal computer software applications.
School trips are an important part of every classroom and it is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual field trips, where students can look at objects on display in a museum, visit an aquarium, or gaze at beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and every year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online in the form of scrapbooks.
Blogging can also contribute to improving students' writing.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are usually the most critical readers, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "demands that students be more understanding of the world around them". The need to pique the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower learners to be more analytical and critical, through active response to Internet content, they can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as establish their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and home to a variety of museums and art galleries showcasing the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse beyond.
All these and more are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that comes as a big surprise to many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route from the Cape to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be helpful to wear a ring (just try not to make it look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who installed their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
Traditional Moroccan items, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of trinkets, abound around the old medina, but everything is geared toward tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and submerged many of its streets, especially in the center of the city.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits abroad should be considered in order to gain insight into the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and has some of the cheapest mountain gorilla viewing in Africa.
To get around within Goma, you can opt to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 for a short trip.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Timbuktu" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops on Henry Louis Gates' Wonder of the African World special on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is recognised as a major icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card which allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the homonymous island, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings that delimit Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a luminous bar graph evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront, located in front.
It is on the reclaimed land of Hong Kong's north coast that its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that the British conquerors claimed as their own, so if you want to see evidence of this region's colonial past, this is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove chain, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Nevertheless, the forests are not just mangroves. They contain some of the last remaining trees of the massive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about one-third of its area is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and there are now an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30 000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and convenient way to get around nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed structure that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3,5 m width.
There is a 15-metre-wide free space under the bridge, and although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that now constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished for a living.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other junior tournaments and matches can also be witnessed in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Polo Association you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed at par with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands where you can change your money.
Pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, but you may be able to use British or American currency.
It is virtually impossible to change Falkland Island money outside the archipelago, so try to do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with temperatures often exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive. Although temperatures rarely drop below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rain remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so it should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, he must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from other wildlife.
As tame as they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year for not keeping a proper distance.These animals are large, wild and potentially feral, so respect their space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid having or cooking food that gives off a strong odor and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the harbor was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbor.
They sank all the ships except a British cruiser, killing about 200 Americans and Germans.
During the war for independence that faced the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, as Auckland has two harbours.
In the North Harbour district on the Pacific Ocean are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and most have pohutukawa trees offering shady spots.
In the port of Waitemataas are the beaches of Tamaki Drive, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia might be considered better for transportation.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
A small black coffee is called an "espresso", a cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare there.
Nevertheless, accept the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are located near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. Occasionally, they can be found outside this season.
Sharks do exist, but they hardly ever attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives you peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you in case you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of those attending music events choose to camp at the venue and most spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you'll need to get to camp early to secure a spot near the musical events.
Please note that while musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they may continue into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas, intended for family groups with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check where the cabin is located, as ice crossing is very noisy for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises also spend time in the city, and those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their patrons.
They often offer special promotions of food, drink and entertainment in order to keep guests in good spirits and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free spirits, though drunkenness impairs judgment and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you in a very short time.
In addition, visibility may be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland journeys to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and standard equipment will allow good vision.
At times, lions, cheetahs, and leopards may be shy, so you will have more opportunity to observe them using binoculars.
The excursion known as a walking safari (also called "bushwalking", "hiking safari" or "walking") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] A number of events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Having hosted the sporting event in 1964, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, complications may arise.
There are different types of trip cancellation policies, but as of late March, the coverage of much of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and common passes are expected to cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still wet can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and a board to lend to travelers, even if one is not in the room.
If you do not have an iron handy, or if you do not want to wear ironed stockings, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Try not to let the fabric get too hot, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Different methods are known to purify water, some attacking specific threats more effectively.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal from a certified company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in the regions from which they come.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their force, are not usually included in the pest category.
Duty-free shopping offers an opportunity to purchase duty- and tax-free goods in certain locations.
Travellers visiting countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions and often traverses remote and lonely terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert - there are many steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and following sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict enforcement is even more important than on any other section.
However, interestingly, cell phone reception is much better here than many other sections of the highway like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality, and Bavarian cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those made in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples baked inside throughout the year and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.

The stirrups are the footrests for the riders that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability for the rider, they can present safety problems, as it is possible for your feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from the horse, but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal runs away.
First, most riders wear high-heel riding boots that have a ready, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from its frame if a dislodged rider pulls back.

The idea of skiing is very old, with cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to about 5,000 B.C.E.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates from no later than the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacker in skiing: also known as cross-country skiing or ski touring.
Although linked, it generally does not entail cross-country skiing or alpine style mountaineering, which are developed on steeply sloped ground and with much stiffer skis and footwear.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under satisfactory conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot, but very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a good-weight backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to deal with visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Generally, whenever you move within this region you will be able to cross borders without going through a passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit might be narrower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be classified as antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is a fundamental way of life for the Sami people, and the culture associated with reindeer herding is important to many in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Lapps have engaged in reindeer herding on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern commercial activities, and tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be described as a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "hostile zone course" will likely turn up the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will cover all the topics covered here in much greater detail and generally with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing, first aid, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines on wilderness survival are common, but publications on war zones are scarce.

The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Inspections at security checkpoints have become more invasive since 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their dignity and privacy intact.
Rip currents are the flow that backs up from waves breaking on the shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow gathers in certain deeper areas and there may originate a fast current to deep water.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once it escapes the current, swimming back will be no more complex than usual.
Attempt to get to a place where you cannot be reached again or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it may be wise to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home occurs earlier than the cultural one (there is no "honeymoon" period of happiness), it takes longer to leave and can be harder.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to that new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, for they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also needed for travellers back home.
The light show and pyramidal sound are one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the dark, you can see the pyramids and gaze at them in silence before the show begins.

The service is typically used in water transport, including recreational boats, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can ask your local telephone service provider for more information on how to subscribe to this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option among those planning to take a gap year.
This is very popular among high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.

Usually, a registration fee is charged for enrolment in these programmes.
Finland is an excellent sailing destination. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and deep-water lakes are wide enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most exclusive cruises across the Baltic Sea include a long-term stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the possibility of visiting the historic city for a few whole days during your return journey, sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only disembark during excursions on board, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise ship brochures list Berlin, Germany, but as the map above shows, the city is not near the sea and is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never experienced it or if they have been in a traumatic situation.
This is nothing to be ashamed of. It is no different from other kinds of personal fears and dislikes that plague so many others.

If you shipped by air freight, some routes may have taken days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do it faster was to send it as checked baggage.Airline regulations prohibit carrying baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class on an airplane is to spend a fortune for the privilege (or, better yet, have your airline pay for you).
But this comes at a price: generally speaking, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy fare in business class and up to eleven times in economy class.
It is usually foolish to seek discounts for first- or business-class seats on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
