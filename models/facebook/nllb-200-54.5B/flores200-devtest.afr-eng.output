Not only does it confirm that there were at least some feathered dinosaurs, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers are chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The finding also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, also called the rhachis, but have other features of feathers - shaft feathers and side branches with beards - the researchers deduced that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or repulsion.
The researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chick down.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program is written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius constellation.
The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is found in a type of halo, and is composed of very small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle, then place a pre-printed sheet of paper naming the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the voting booth and signs the list of electors.
French electoral law codified these proceedings rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were there at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those counted and signed by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to specific procedures.

He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been influenced because her image was widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen publication of the photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects".
Kroon Kantoor, which is in overall control of prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made, at least until indictment.
The document will, according to the informant, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Rangers closely supervised shooters in the supplemental pest control trial because the trial was monitored and effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some due since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The minister's office responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been reported dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While employed at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research has shown that if hormones are administered, they will accelerate the fetal lung development.
Xinhua reports that the state investigation team recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Human wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as I was...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 previous voters of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist had been due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware or software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be "a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth was formed, since comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political chatter and foolishness.
People are speculating that he will make an attempt in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controller to pin down the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-go facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a loss of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced behind closed doors and without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species has adapted in only two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into small molds.
It can be drawn into a thin thread, which can be twisted or braided, beaten out, or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and glued to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons have been removed (as Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-dara had a flush toilet in almost every home, and it was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were mixed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat having a special job that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups known as prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion but more like a series of shrill cries.
Small wildcats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the wildcat hunts are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that "ocelots" follow and locate animals (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground to find out where the animals have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move around unnoticed.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population from which they came (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a very different environment from the one they were in before.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, still requiring the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the top predator on the food chain of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw has more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
His diet included shellfish, large fish, mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would have been no match for it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts involving wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of marsupial known as a Hazelmouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman diets could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a principal temple that was viewed as the dwelling of the deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner chamber to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were open counters facing the street; stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is told that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
IF YOU saw the movie National Treasure, you might think that there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Engraved on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it's possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but still the south was not free.
It was controlled by the "Vichy" French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by significant numbers of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture relies on the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judicial branch, they relied on state governments, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all their acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in International games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago" due to the cluster of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base southwest of Taiwan, and transformed native grain production practices by hiring Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining some order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith bound European states together despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the community members.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary fund of the church is there specifically for this reason.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of rioting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade has violated generally accepted international laws through various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large areas of the ocean, which would be dangerous even for neutral vessels.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period that occurred in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true for the army, since army ranks were now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has long survived, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests atop one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
Nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "arch" mark looks like a V and the "deflection" mark looks like a stapler or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the point and press the bow, and down means to start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to insert your own notes, but remember that the printed line markings are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while they were surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the protesters waved the head of a royal executed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The war losses incurred by U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are obliged to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds driven by the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits obtained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological necessity in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most disruptions of technological determinations share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces "effects" on society that are indigenous, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture arose that were tied to that environment, and these things, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Because of slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind at a rate of 25 to 30 per year.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was due to the Crusades when people started to use knots to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, mostly organic system that combines preserved seeds native to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characterized by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, including fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adverse circumstances, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as the children grew up.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to parental rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some lived on their own in the wild.
When a feral child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely like those of the particular foster animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are beginning to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolding is in the software and is meant to question, accelerate, and explain procedures to students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable schooling, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the essentials that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and rewards approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience reactions to websites, they identified "Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is reported that one can tell when a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, The President's Speech, showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the plants available there.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated with the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war and clashes of system, process and culture that led to the countries that dropped out.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was the last for the next 40 years and would actually be fought, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII, in which the Americans attempted to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany might well have been able to conquer Britain as it could conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds who were multiple children or teenagers, similar to the more ubiquitous sheep herders.
Wasp tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wax tracks were usually made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses that hauled them to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than would be required to do so on the nearly rougher roads of the day.
Crosspieces were inserted fairly early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective if there was an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more kindly toward the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It is like the symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should neutralize them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant life-style.
After passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing office of John Dunlap.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap whips are known to be the oldest extant copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first - aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or house of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenting so that another couple may adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method actually accompanies most scientific research.
Although not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will maintain a period of free-running cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphor or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting Borneo and learning about and photographing orangutans.
Every morning people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has upset the biosphere's stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems breed such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers act within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These ratios help in the planning, design, and operation of level facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over the body.
This gives them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems to make sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians were amazed by their predecessors' monuments, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many who work in states where Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they could change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it first came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and use declined as newer writing methods were adopted.
People now write messages on billing screens, and don't need to be near a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer passes by.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. The fission of a nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they break apart with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that causes them to do or not do certain good.
Two popular theories of needs are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior may emerge when managers begin to manage their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels like he or she has to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet at different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to establish a learning organization? One purpose of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come through.
As a result, an organization's process works together to overcome the obstacle and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized learning before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the research area and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, tears, and tumors affect performance and, in some cases, alter some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the brain's structures and processes as never before.
These provide us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connection to science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is also built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their drive to the state capitol. Every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".) The need to feed the crowd's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as more than what outsiders consider truly Canadian.
Vast areas farther north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent unto itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it became firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it is one that does not look expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when turning men away, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cooking pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of excesses, but that's as much for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping-off point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of the dangers of the desert sand.
It was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
In stark contrast with the rest of the country, the city has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a "Wild Card" which gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a dazzling colonnade accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel across to the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halophytic swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going in an easterly direction, depart for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is suggested that a ticket be purchased a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Carpooling is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m] and are 1,200 feet [378 m] long, with two lanes 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September of 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The most notable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay were the Guarani, who lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the skirmish of Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and contests can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In the outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency will be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine the accepted method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures barely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears, wolves, and 25 yards [25 m] from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may appear, buffalo, deer, caribou, bears, and almost any large animal can be attacked.
These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
In doing so, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British warship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village caused the death of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland straddles two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
North Coast beaches (in North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good array of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is quite safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A short black is 'espresso,' cappuccino is served with heavy cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equivalent to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the reef from any of these causes are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all notices, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but very rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater Crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to lounge when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodations, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the meetings for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're going to have to get there early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stages may be ending, there may be sections of the festival that will continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic region in winter, be sure of the hut's location, as it makes a lot of noise for those most affected to pass through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in the city. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To stick to their principle as well as to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment.
However, drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
Friction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a bare tarmac.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall quickly in a short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or windblown snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many lands, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari that is popularly used refers to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "forest walk", "walking safari", or going "walking") consists of a walk of a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to June 2020 for when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000 with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for rent, even if there is not one in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it frequently traverses deserted inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your distance: steep grades, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Strangely, cell phone service here is better than many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples baked into pies throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing during summer months.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on your region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is common in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of local dishes from across the nation.
However, when used with further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originally from central and eastern parts of mainland Java.
Javanese food now freely available across the archipelago is characterized by simply flavored dishes, the prominent seasoning for Javanese food being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Handrails are for supporting the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If a horse throws the rider and his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged along as the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup's belt to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly searching for new routes between the endless rock faces.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", planning entire vacations to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings from as far back as 5000 B.C. depict skiers!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity may also be called inland skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to, but does not include, alpine ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done on steeper terrain and requiring stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will cover somewhat greater distances than by walking - but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant going through multiple visa applications and passport control points.
