Not only is it reassuring to know that dinosaurs had feathers, the most common form of feathering, but it also provides information that cannot be gleaned from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to scientists, the top of the animal's bill was misshapen and its underside white.
Their findings have also shed light on the evolution of feathers.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed tip, called a rachis, but are covered with additional features - such as whiskers and beards - researchers believe that the rachis may have been the tallest of any known animal.
The design of the feathers suggests that they were not designed for flight but for use as thermometers or temperature gauges. Researchers have suggested that although this is a juvenile tail, the pattern is consistent with adult feathers and not juvenile feathers.
The researchers said that even though the specimen belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the feathers matched those of an adult, not a juvenile.

Last month a presidential delegation demanded that the CEP resign as part of the process of leading the country to new elections.
The tax fraud was Martelly's response to the October coup attempt.
Some of the recent protests were sparked by failed elections, while others have not taken place since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of iPod fire were reported, resulting in six accidents and leaving victims with minor burns.

While working at the hospital, Liggins began interviewing employees before the end of the year.
Her research showed that the hormone produced in the lining of the womb prepares the eggs for fertilization.
Xinhua reported that government inspectors seized the plane's bilingual "black box" recorders on Wednesday.
Luna is praised by his fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first woman president of Extreme", said Tommy Dreamer. "She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said "Luna was as bad as me...maybe worse...we loved her and we miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted in the 2008 election, 8 percent were against independence.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke during the 2010 federal election campaign and expressed hope that Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of monolingual respondents want Queen Elizabeth to be the next Prime Minister of Australia.
In terms of infrastructure, 29 per cent of Australia's population is expected to be urbanised soon, while 31 per cent is expected to remain urbanised.
An Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events and to compete in three Commonwealth Games, but his record was called into question.
He was unable to take the prescribed pain medication because of the ban.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a large prime number on January 25.
Many people pointed to the scientific breakthroughs and discoveries in the February issue of the newsmagazine on the second day.
Where stars may be present, water on the earth's surface could be produced, as well as proteins and life-sustaining elements in the fossil record.
Scientists hope that the passage of time will shed light on the origin of planetary systems, especially on the origin of our earth.
The 53-year-old Cuomo launched his presidential bid earlier this year and passed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the news media as "political noise and empty chatter".
He is widely considered to be a candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is an FAA-approved technology that could enable aircraft to fly shorter distances while saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than ground-based radar to give air traffic controllers a clear view of even the smallest aircraft and to provide pilots with precise information.
There is no underground railway station at Wembley, and there is no underground parking or bus station.
Concerns about transportation have led to suggestions that the team play behind closed doors and away from fans.
The slide presentation that Luzabu presented to the public on Thursday featured an illustration of a Galapagos tortoise.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have succeeded in breeding a new species in a single generation, although this process takes much longer, by breeding the endemic Darwin's finch, the hardy Geospiza, and the immigrant cactus Roselin, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into almost any shape or form.
They can be made of metal, which can be polished to a high finish, mounted on bed frames, or fashioned into beads.
Because they could be made so small, they were used to fasten the ends of hand-woven scrolls known as "sewing needles".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Tears change color depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of the soil.
The pH value is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (represented by the letter H in pH) in a chemical compound.
Hydrogen molecules are protons stripped of electrons (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Gathering the flour with unwashed hands was a gesture of hospitality.
The dirt on your hands releases a foreign substance when it comes in contact with the outer layer, which is normally smooth and shiny.
The ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have water-filled latrines in virtually every home, equipped with sophisticated ventilation systems.
Remains of aqueducts have been found at Minoan sites on Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, public baths were sometimes shared by both men and women.
When you make a long-distance phone call, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the signal and instantly relays it back to earth.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere blocks out some of the light and other wavelengths that we can see.
It takes a spacecraft more than 100 feet [30 m] long to launch a satellite or a telescope into orbit.
Bicycles have changed the world in remarkable ways, not the least of which is that they have made travel easier and faster.
We have trains, automobiles, and other means of transportation.
In their homeland, there are many medium-sized chimps that feed on everything from rabbits to antelope to bison.
Finally, there are the many smaller apes (including monkeys) that feed on insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in their niche, or niche market, which is an important part of their overall competitive position.
Lions are gregarious animals, living in large groups called prides.
In a pride there may be from one to three adult males, as well as up to 30 females and cubs.
Often they are a close-knit group, a large brotherhood.
A pride of lions often acts like wolves or hyenas, animals that resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and it is especially vicious toward its prey.
The agile tiger can leap (but not over a precipice), jump, leap great distances, and lift objects with more force than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the genus Pathera, which includes lions, leopards, and jaguars.
A tiger's roar may not be as loud as a lion's, but it is no less powerful.
It preys on small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds - all of which are much smaller than its prey.
Scientists believe that hyenas stalk and catch their prey by using their sense of smell to navigate through the earth.
The Bible speaks of the eagle as hiding from predators by moving into its territory and stalking its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population) becomes separated from the main body of the community (such as by moving to a mountaintop or a beach or to a new island and not being able to return), they often find themselves in a completely different environment.
In this new environment with its new equipment and opponents, would-be fighters would need new equipment or adaptations in order to become better fighters.
The original inhabitants of the area have remained largely unchanged, preferring to maintain their traditional way of life.
In time, as the new arrivals adjust to their new surroundings, they will no doubt be very different from the old ones.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they can no longer be considered a single species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the production of new species - a natural and inevitable part of evolution.
Plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the atmosphere.
Plants use photosynthesis to make food from sunlight and also to provide shade.
We use trees to make our homes, our clothes, and most of our food; without them, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most powerful creature of its day, not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long, sticky jaws with more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as the roof of its mouth, mean that nothing can climb over it.
Its diet included worms, large fish, mosasaurs, and possibly man-eaters.
It attacked everything that moved in the water - even dinosaurs as large as the T. rex.
While many of their foods are similar to ours, the Romans had their own strange or exotic celebrations, such as wild boar, peacocks, turkeys, and partridges.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women usually ate on couches, the rich often enjoyed banquets where they sat side by side at the table.
Ancient Roman cuisine would not have included foods that had arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries earlier.
For example, they do not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa.
To all appearances, the Babylonians had a huge temple dedicated to their gods.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods by holding festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and a holy place to which only the priests could go.
At times, elaborate pyramidlike roof structures called ziggurats were built to house temples.
The top of the tower served as a shrine to the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, housing was not a luxury.
Much of Hebrew life revolved around the outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the storerooms were open-air corners facing the street.
Timber was scarce in the land of Canaan, and wood was expensive.
According to Norse legend, Erik the Red settled in Iceland as a convicted murderer and discovered Greenland and named it Greenland during his voyage westward.
In spite of what he saw, however, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although it was a "Scandinavian" country, it differed greatly in population, rulers, customs, and history from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
When you watch the movie National Treasure, you might imagine a treasure map on the back of a declaration of independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the card, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", found in the margin.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it was originally a parchment codex (about nine and a half by nine inches) that had been carefully hidden.
Hence, it seems that the addition of the letters was merely a matter of convenience.
The Allied bombing and ensuing battle gave the northern part of France independence, but not the south.
They were French citizens who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and had collaborated with the Resistance rather than fight against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the newly independent American and French armies liberated southern France and began to withdraw.
A civilization is a culture in which large numbers of people live and work together as a group.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, from civis, meaning a person from, and civitas, meaning a city or town.
A civilization is a group of people who share a common history, heritage, and way of life.
Simple customs often disappear without a trace and are not remembered as part of civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially formed a federal government, with Congress as its only instrument, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and in the absence of a central government or judiciary, it relied on provincial governors, often at odds with them, to enforce its laws.
It also had no authority to pass laws or collect taxes between provinces.
The Charter had to be ratified by the provinces before it could go into effect, and the provinces were often represented by laymen.
The Italian national soccer team, along with the German national team, are two of the world's most successful teams and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice skating, hockey, and Formula One or auto racing.
Winter sports are popular in the north, and Italians have competed in international tournaments and the Olympics.
Consisting of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world!
For the group of islands that Japan consists of, Japan is often referred to as "archipelago" or "archipelago".
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, trading locally produced grain for Chinese laborers to cultivate rice and rice.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) annexed western and northern Taiwan and made Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main sections - the Intuhuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the castle have been restored to show visitors what it looked like when it was first built.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored, and work is still under way.
For example, the most popular movie format is the 35 mm format, which was the standard movie format in the early days of film.
They continue to be produced today, but more importantly, the difference in height / width is a result of digital imaging technology.
The 35 mm format often causes conflicts, and the 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
A typical aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the correct reading) is 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, those of the APS group) are at or near the same level.
A third technique, less damaging and more subtle, is the dynamic range-finding technique of hiding a fine line in a picture.
It states that the most important point for the subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the figure into thirds in descending and ascending order (see example).
At this point in Europe's history, the Catholic Church, with its wealth and power, was taking the lead.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian congregation held Europe together despite its linguistic and cultural differences.
Its sovereignty extended to all, from the king to the common man.
An important teaching of Christianity is that material wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty and that congregation contributions should be used for that purpose.
The church's monopoly of power in Rome for more than a thousand years and its centralization of power and wealth have led many to question whether it is fulfilling that role.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain decided to blockade the German coastal waters.
The tactic worked well, capturing the army and most of the valuable supplies, despite being illegal in most countries two centuries earlier.
Britain blockaded international waters to prevent any naval vessels from entering her coastlines, posing a threat even to civilian shipping.
The tactic was met with silence, and Germany expected a similar response from her submarines.
During the 1920's, many societies and countries enjoyed relative peace and self-sufficiency.
After the horrors and carnage of World War I had passed, the nations were anxious about the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of marking time; each step or dynasty represented a different kingdom.
The period of the Three Kingdoms, which began with the Han dynasty and ended with the Jin dynasty, lasted about 60 years.
During that time, dynastic wars were fought between rival families for control of the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with rival claimants to the throne of the mighty Xi'an dynasty being put to death.
There are many answers to the social and political problem of destroying the use of the ballot box, the declaration of a government by the people and the democratic, representative government by the people. National sovereignty is something that belongs to the citizens of a sovereign state.
Moreover, after the Liberation, education was made available to all boys, and those who were ambitious and successful gained political power.
Similarly, in the military, rank was assigned according to merit instead of education.
France's independence movement also galvanized oppressed peoples in other countries.
Muhammad was preoccupied with the affairs of this world. He often used the mosque called "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for meditation.
He dug it out himself, and it has survived, providing insight into Muhammad's spiritual values.
Located on a hill to the north of Mecca, the oasis is truly isolated from the world.
In fact, you would hardly notice it even if you knew it was there.
There is nothing to see except the clear blue sky and the nearby mountains, and you can see and hear very little of this world from there.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still stands.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is the last of the great pyramids built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings contains numerous pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), numerous small tombs, temples, and a colossal Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper case" symbol looks like a V and the "lower case" like a button or a rectangle.
The upper part of the arrow points away from the bowstring, while the lower part points away from the bowstring.
A rainbow above produces a gentle sound, while a rainbow below produces a loud and clear tone.
You have the freedom to write with your own pen, but remember that the markings on the page are for music and should always be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the frightened Queen Mother Elizabeth were forcibly taken from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the King and Queen to roll down the open windows of their car.
On one occasion, a member of the crowd waved an arrow at a guard of the royal family at Versailles before the startled Queen.
The cost of the U.S. occupation of the Philippines was borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. tyrannical government so that most of the money could be used to finance the war and their own welfare, which was then transferred to Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
In fact, slave labor in the Philippines was a major source of income for the United States.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must first understand the events that led to their formation.
This era is sometimes called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term with many meanings, ranging from the push for technology or what technology should do, to the idea that the future of humanity depends on fundamental events that are in accordance with scientific laws and how they are reflected in technology.
Many Technological Determinism theories share two common assumptions: that the development of technology itself follows a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology's "impact" on society is determined by social rather than biological factors.
To illustrate, one might speak of automobiles as a means of getting around.
However, highways are not economically viable for only a few vehicles, so new methods are being developed to alleviate traffic congestion.
The growth of the automobile has also contributed to an increase in accidents, and it has opened up new avenues of medical treatment.
Romantic literature is heavily influenced by the tradition of determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism, geography shaped human society, and over the centuries cultural norms and values associated with geography developed, which, being geographically specific, were superior to those imposed by force.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its heyday as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its popularity waned in the 12th century, largely as a result of crusaders returning with gifts of silks and spices more desirable than those found on Byzantine markets.
Constantinople lost its status as the fashion capital of the world to Paris during this period.
Gothic architecture flourished during the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
At first, the fabric of the bands was strongly influenced by the eastern Byzantine tradition.
However, because of the slowness with which word spread, the western style could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, fashions in western Europe began to develop independently of one another.
A food-producing farm is one that produces enough food to feed itself and its family.
Farming a family's basic needs is relatively simple, often involving the use of local materials, stored seeds, and high-yield farming techniques.
Historically, most farmers grew their own food, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel alienated from others and help them to understand themselves better.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that distinguish subcultures may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination thereof.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership with distinctive gestures and symbols, such as clothing, gestures, and speech.
One well-known way to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider the experiences of abused children who, because of neglect, trauma, or abuse, were isolated from adults during their formative years.
Some animal offspring are hidden from humans (usually their parents), while others are abandoned by their parents because they are mentally or physically disabled.
Animal babies are often mistreated or traumatized before they are abandoned or run away.
Some are said to have been domesticated by animals; others to have evolved on their own.
When raised exclusively with nonhuman animals, the offspring display many of the same characteristics as their nonhuman parents, such as fear or dislike of humans.
While learning activities should make learning easier and more enjoyable, scaffolding is even more effective.
The staircase is not a formal teaching tool, but it is helpful for people learning a new skill, such as using a new computer program or starting a new job.
The mirror can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is like a mirror but like a mini keyboard for Microsoft Office.
The virtual stairs are part of a computer program and are not intended to ask, simulate, or explain how to do something that the student may find difficult to do on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even forced labor.
A child cannot thrive in an environment that is hostile, unloving, and unkind.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our family-based child-rearing program should provide children with a safe home, loving care, adequate education, and health care.
Stepfamilies should make sure that children have the basic necessities of life that are lacking in their previous home.
The Internet combines social networking with face-to-face communication.
The Internet's openness has led to advances in technology and its applications.
For example, "education" and "social networking" have been cited as common motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also point to "commitment" and "friendship" as new drivers, based on their observations of social networks.
The use of video has made it possible to convey brief speech, facial expressions, and body language in just a few seconds.
It has been said that you can usually tell when someone is lying if you pay close attention to subtle clues.
In his book Words of the President, Oliver Sack noted that people who are unable to understand speech because of abnormalities of the brain usually understand it better when it is presented honestly.
He even said that this ability is found in domestic animals, such as domestic dogs.
During the 20th century, researchers identified two types of bullying - subtle and overt.
Evolution produces new species, while selection removes them from the population.
Separating and recombining reverses the difference between the two groups in each generation.
Without vegetation, it is difficult for an animal with a digestive system like ours to obtain the amino acids it needs from plants.
Moreover, failure to do so is fraught with serious consequences - poor growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest sources of protein to obtain would be vegetable proteins, but these are difficult to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, guinea pigs, eggs) are easy to digest, yet rich in protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not be surprising that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" much as modern-day geckos do.
A power nap is a period of voluntary awakening from sleep and falling asleep within 10 to 60 minutes.
This can easily be done by using an alarm clock to wake you up without having to get out of bed.
If you find yourself setting your alarm for bedtime, it may go off in another part of the room, causing you to have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other postural techniques involve drinking large amounts of fluids (usually water or tea) before going to bed to stimulate the urge to urinate.
Much of the inner peace that a person enjoys is directly related to the inner struggle between his flesh and his spirit.
The fewer conflicts there are, the better the quality of life. Everyone can find peace and happiness.
The only thing that can stop us from doing so is our own fears and prejudices.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has also been influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and to a lesser extent, by Indian Yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It involves the practice of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all beings.
In Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Goddess Yoga, through which powerful pathways are opened, chakras are activated, and enlightenment occurs.
Germany's role as an enemy of mankind during World War II led to an alliance between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. At the end of the war, the nations were divided by cultural rivalries.
During the last two years of the war, former allies became enemies, sparking the Cold War.
They did so for the next 40 years and fought fairly, in allied armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish army had already fallen and their only hope was to retreat and rejoin the Romanians.
However, those hopes were abruptly shattered when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian armies after conquering eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Cargo ships are an efficient means of transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The ships' main function was to allow nations to move men and supplies from one area to another while at the same time interdicting enemy shipping.
A notable modern-day example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the U.S. Navy struggled to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the German U-boat fleet was steadily closing in on them.
If it had not succeeded, Britain might well have suffered the same fate as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats seems to have begun about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes adopted them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Traditionally, they were kept in a flock that moved about on the mountain or pasture, under the watchful eye of children or young adults, much like a shepherd.
Railways were first built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the rails were wooden at both ends, they allowed the horses to run faster and to pull heavier loads than could be done on paved roads.
Crossties were originally designed to improve road surfaces, but it was later discovered that they could be made safer by adding metal over the top.
The production of steel became widespread, but iron was more corrosive than wooden wheels.
Eventually, cast-iron wheels replaced the wooden ones, and in 1767 the first railway was built.
The earliest known transport is the upright gait two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright on stilts like modern humans.
Bipedalism is seen in Australopithecus fossils dated to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus also walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by improving our communities, we can join the environmental movement, and we can help to mitigate some of the problems of the future.
However, if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problem and correct it.
Clearly, advances in science and technology have dramatically changed the world, and the challenges of living longer and longer have never been greater.
After the House voted on July 4, the president, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, signed the bill and sent it to Joah Dunlap for printing.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made of what is now known as the Dunlap Codex.
The first public reading was given by John Nixon on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to the troops in New York on July 9, and arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's 25 volumes are the oldest existing copies of the codex, and the original manuscript has been lost.
Most modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived into modern times.
Most people would not call them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many ways in which birds are similar to dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and antennae, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like T-Rex.
In fact, all modern computers are based on information encoded in binary code.
A binary number can have one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits, to use computer terminology.
Toxins in the body are not readily detected, and symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, may not indicate the presence of disease.
The good news is that toxins in the body can act as a disinfectant or a disinfectant replacement.
Consult the manufacturer's instructions for proper use of the product.
Entomologists use the word "insect" to describe this group of insects.
The word is derived from resurrection, the common term for insects that live as humans.
Bedbugs and cockroaches are notorious pests, and they are known to live in human dwellings.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects an estimated 400,000 people in the United States alone, making it the leading cause of disability among adolescents and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
The couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have children.
A couple may decide to adopt a child.
In the case of an adoption, the biological parents forfeit their right to the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the universe works by scientific methods, and this is the basis for most scientific research.
Experimentation, however, is not limited to mere experimentation; it is also used to test hypotheses, formulate questions, and arrive at conclusions.
Naturalists and philosophers were intrigued by important texts, especially the Latin Bilia.
Aristotle's ideas had a profound influence on virtually every field of science, including psychology.
As Greek learning declined, Europe became increasingly cut off from its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
Many phenomena that we observe in physiology and behavior are often influenced by the presence of endogenous rhythms and their interaction with biological clocks.
Synchronous rhythms, which are not simply physical responses, have been observed in countless living organisms, including bacteria, brains, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are mechanical timepieces that keep perfect time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first experiments to show that DNA was hereditary.
Hershey and Chase used bacteria, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
In two experiments, DNA was added to radioactive phosphorus or to radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary greatly, depending on the type of mutation, the quality of the donor, and the identity of the recipient cell.
Only mutations in the genes can be passed on to offspring, but other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is the practice of visiting remote places to admire the beauty of nature.
Some of the local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and historical sites.
One example is the Bornean orangutan, which has been photographed and studied extensively.

Everyone is involved in community life and uses public transportation.
In the developed world, we rarely hear complaints about floods or collapsing bridges.
Why do people complain so much about transportation, and why does it fail so miserably every day?
Traffic analysis is the study of how drivers and vehicles behave between two points and at intersections.
Unfortunately, learning to drive is notoriously unpredictable.
Fortunately, all drivers have some common characteristics, so the study of traffic patterns is relatively simple and can be analyzed mathematically.
To put things in perspective, consider a comparison of three basic categories of roads: (1) distance traveled, (2) number of vehicles, and (3) speed.
A contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to do so enables them to evade predators and find suitable food and mates.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings into their body.
As a result, they were able to find refuge from their enemies in many sheltered places.
Today, the only insects that cannot stretch their wings are black butterflies.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus of Samos proposed that our solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought that he was correct, but many thought otherwise - that the earth, the solar system, and even the sun (and possibly other stars) revolve around the sun.
That seems reasonable, since the earth does not seem to move, does it?

The chemistry of gold, silver, and copper has long been known because of their physical properties and the ease with which they can be mined using primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four classical elements (energy, water, air, and plasma, in that order), although he also proposed that these elements change into new elements to produce physical matter.
Remember, there are many elements on the Periodic Table.
Calcium and potassium are said to be alloys, as are metals such as silver and gold.
There are alloys that contain many elements other than iron, such as carbon.
All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit into the tiny speck at the end of this sentence.
That is why the pencil was such a popular companion when it first appeared.

There may have been pools nearby because the crust was thinner, allowing hot water to run off.
Its inner wisdom is focused on finding that which excites or satisfies.
According to this theory, people develop desires and/or passions as they grow older.

Online teams follow the same rules for good communication as any other team - with a few key differences.
Online communities often serve as hubs for networking among their members.
They have more freedom than workers in a factory because their teams can meet at different times, unbeknownst to management.
Having a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an important feature of an online community.
This "invisible team" is made up of the directors to whom each member reports.
Why should a group want to adopt a time-consuming method of study?

It provides a wealth of information and imaging data that can help us understand how the brain works.
Although AI is not closely related to exact science, it is an important branch of computer science, modeling behavior, learning, and artificial intelligence in a machine.
AI research involves designing machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include managing, planning, problem solving, and answering questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, tone of voice, and facial expressions.
Such theories tend to become dogmas in their own right, centering on adjusting to the realities of life.
AI has been widely used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many computer programs and video games.
Often the instructor may want to take his students to places where buses do not stop.
With the help of modern technology, students can take a virtual tour of a museum, an aquarium, or an art gallery - all from the comfort of their classroom.
Virtual tours are also a good way to visualize the tour and share the information with other students in the future.
For example, each student at Bennet School in North Carolina creates a Web page about his or her visit to the nation's capital, which is updated each year.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although many students start blogging with many spelling and grammar mistakes, the advent of the Internet is changing this too.
Since students are often very critical, the blogger tries to improve his technique so that he is not criticized.
The use of blogs "empowers students to become more aware of the world around them".
Blogging is a collaborative project that encourages students to develop their study skills beyond the classroom.
Effective use of blogs "can help students develop critical thinking skills; by commenting online, students can compare their own writing skills with those of others and clearly express their own opinions on a particular topic" (Oravec, 2002).
