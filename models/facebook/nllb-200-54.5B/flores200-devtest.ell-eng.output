Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the animal's feathers were brown above and light or carrot below.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of feathering in birds.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed shaft, called a dorsal fin, but have other features of feathers - fins and tails - the researchers concluded that the dorsal fin was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display. Scientists claim that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not chick plumage.
Researchers say that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests adult plumage, not juvenile.

The part of the project that was completed was primarily theoretical, however the program was designed to replicate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
What the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, creating tides, the Milky Way pulls on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter found in a galaxy is located around the galaxy, forming a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves behind a screen and place a pre-printed sheet of paper listing the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, he throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Gajah Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car struck, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The accident road was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Anthea has since been charged by the High Court in Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She's in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been compromised as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, however justice in Scotland works differently and courts have ruled that publishing photographs is potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists seem to be treading a fine line if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The Public Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed journalists that there will be no further comment at least until charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues reportedly covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both states, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The target shooters in the supplementary pest control trial would be closely supervised by the rangers as the trial was tested and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Shooting Federation of Australia (NSW), special volunteers were recruited as part of the Shooting Federation's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, General Manager for Park Conservation and Heritage of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four marksmen selected for the first hunting operation received thorough safety instructions and training.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth temporary election board in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-establishment protests that began in October.
Some violent protests have taken place over the lack of elections, some pending since 2011.
According to official reports, there were approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions resulting in overheating, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The department responded by calling the postponement of Apple's filing "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage in their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino former policeman took Hong Kong visitors hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, his country's capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later substituted an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
She trained and became a gynaecologist, starting work in 1959 at the Government Women's Clinic, Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began researching preterm labor.
According to his research, if given a hormone, the fetal lung would mature.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday located two "black box" flight data recorders.
The fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme contest. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a constitutional democracy when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed with this idea because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At both ends of the poll, 29% of all respondents thought Australia should become a republic without a monarch as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic without a monarch.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle and three relay swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but his discomfort has called into question his fitness.
He couldn't get the pain medication he needed because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number ever found.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of transportation of water to earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He's rumored to be running for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the next-generation air transportation system would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based - as opposed to older ground-based radar technology - to allow air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is carried out and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking spaces and parking and transfer infrastructure are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raise the possibility that the game will be forced behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in Science spoke of the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is thought to have taken much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be sculpted into all shapes. It can be formed into shapes of minimal size.
It can be carved into the shape of fine wire, and then curved and woven.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals, and it can become so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-drawn pictures of books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (as a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Swirl the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, compress them into a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer layers, which will create a strange sensation and create a kind of peel.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had one flush toilet for each household, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Also, in Greece, ruins of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan settlements of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where everyone of either sex formed a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who is far away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back to earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and experts have space telescopes because our planet's atmosphere creates distortions in light and in our visibility.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel's contribution to the world is astonishing, but most important of all, it's the simplest and fastest way to get around.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelope and deer.
After all, there are many predatory kittens (including free-roaming domestic cats) that prey on the multitude of bugs, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the idea of place, a special role for each cat, which prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult males related to each other along with up to thirty females and their young.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as an accomplished athlete, can climb (not very well), swim, make giant leaps, and exert five times as much force as a strong man to lift something.
The tiger belongs to the same order (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars; these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but is more like a phrase of angry, shouting words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and even birds. Almost all animals the ocelot hunts are smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to feed on by scent, sniffing the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their environment and then attacking their prey by surprise.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (for example if it moves to a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return) it will often encounter a different environment than before.
This new environment has new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what was required in the past.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, the same adjustments need to be made as in the past.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, their resemblance to the rest of the population diminishes.
At some point, thousands or perhaps millions of years from now, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made from plants, the majority of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, the survival of animals would be impossible.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its day, so it wasn't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws boasted over 70 razor-sharp teeth coupled with an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, suggesting there was no escape for anything in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even the giant dinosaur Tyrannosaurus wouldn't have been a match for it.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans also enjoyed a number of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a guinea pig.
Another difference is that the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax on their side while eating.
Meals in ancient Rome could not have contained foods that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten a turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a principal temple that was viewed as the god's residence.
The people would sacrifice to the deities, and the priesthood would attempt to fulfill the deities' wishes by holding rituals and celebrations.
In each temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests have access.
Sometimes certain towers were built in a pyramidal shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of its life in the countryside.
Women cooked in the courtyard while shops were open benches facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not well forested, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite its discovery, Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Nordic", the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence issued July 4, 1776". This is written below, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
The footnote may therefore have been added merely as a footnote.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy government, which was made up of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were collaborating with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that actually kind of describes the size of the society.
City-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural imprint and exquisite diffusion.
Often, smaller civilizations die out without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a powerless central government - with Congress as the sole component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial branch, it relied on uncooperative state authorities to enforce all laws.
Moreover, it had no jurisdiction to override the laws on taxation and duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that often their representatives were absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
There are nearly 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island on the planet!
Due to its island group, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago' in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's origin can be traced back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began a transformation in the practices by which native grains were produced, employing Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the west and north of Taiwan and made it an administrative region of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then concludes the Treaty of Shimonoseki, where Taiwan passes into Japanese hands until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Indihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
30% of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the predominant film size in the late analog film era.
It is produced to this day, but more important is the aspect ratio inherited from the image sensor forms of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this arrangement (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format category, for example) equal or closely approach these aspect ratios.
The rule of three, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order within one meter of an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the picture into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has forged unbreakable bonds between European nations despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to common mortals.
One of Christianity's core beliefs is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and suffering, and church funds are raised specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
Great Britain began to blockade Germany from the sea immediately after the beginning of the attacks.
The strategy has been effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has laid mines in international waters in order to impede the movement of ships in any part of the sea threatening even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most people and nations was one of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct time period, each stage of China or each dynasty that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable era of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms which prevailed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times fierce warfare raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people died fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are many and include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to all the people.
Also, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male job seekers, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true in the army, where rankings were now based on caliber rather than category.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in matters beyond this worldly life and often visited a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where he survived in time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is away from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy for someone to find it even if they know of its existence.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very few things of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidlike structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Cheops), some small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids and smaller tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The sign indicating that the beam should move upward looks like a V, and the sign indicating that it should move downward looks like a staple wire or a square with no bottom.
Playing upwards means you have to start from the edge, pushing the bow, and playing downwards means you have to start from the frog (the point where your hand is holding the bow) and pull it.
Playing the bow upward produces a softer sound, while playing it downward is louder and more forceful.
You are free to make your own markings, but keep in mind that existing ones serve a musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women in the marketplace forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, who were terrified, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd began shaking the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the horrified queen's eyes.
The expenses of the imperialist war of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs and the interest on the bonds was incentivized on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits resulting from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is often referred to as the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000-1,300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or imposition of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely away from cultural and political influence and that technology in turn exerts "influence" on societies inherently, rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, one might argue that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership also leads to higher rates of traffic accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in health care to repair physical injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, coming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultural elements related to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern era, so Constantinople was the corresponding European source during feudalism.
Its reputation as a center of plenty began to spread about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, mainly because of the crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which had a higher value than the products of the Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, slow communication channels meant delays of 25 to 30 years in Western technology.
One of the most important developments of the era, which came about as a result of the Crusades, was that people started fastening their clothes with buttons.
Conservation agriculture is agriculture undertaken to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Survival agriculture is a simple, usually organic system of using stored seeds derived from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location, and/or race.
The attributes of a subculture that make it distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
To mark their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, behaviors, and slang.
A major technique for the meaning of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate incidents of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or abuse, were not socialized with adults during their lifetime.
Some feral children have been abandoned by humans, usually their own parents; in some cases this abandonment was due to rejection by the parents due to the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Feral children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or before running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
A feral child, when raised entirely by animals without contact with humans, exhibits behaviours (within natural limits) that are almost identical to those of the particular animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, teaching aids go a step further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning but more of a helping hand to people who are undergoing a new teaching experience, like learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual scaffolds and there are real scaffolds, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office connector guy.
Virtual aids are built into the software and are intended to question, promote and explain processes that may have been too difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love and education, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, solid education and affordable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which he was removed.
The Internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet result in additional dimensions in terms of approximation of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are seen as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' were also identified as aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
Video has helped us make important discoveries in our understanding of microscopic expressions, that is, our expressions that last an infinitesimal amount of time.
Specifically, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his dissertation entitled "The President's Speech", states that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to distinguish sincerity accurately.
It is further thought that these abilities in understanding human behavior are present in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
Discrimination and mixing redistributes diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out on the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human's to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so had serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be proteins that can adhere to leaves and stems, but are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also an important source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all the evidence, it's not surprising that our ancestors approached the protein question the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah right now.
Sleep onset is the process by which you consciously wake up during your normal sleep period and go back to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you can regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you catch yourself turning off the alarm while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on circadian rhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bedtime to force one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less pressure there is, the better the life force is present, each individual has the potential to find absolute peace and pleasure.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded from the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in principle, is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (enlightening) energy is awakened due to the movements, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantras and visualizations.
Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts at the level of system, processes and culture led the two countries to a rift.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and have proxy wars fought on battlefields from Africa to Asia to Afghanistan to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had already been broken, and their only hope was to retreat and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans ceased to be beneficial almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
A seaman's job has long been to ensure that your country can transport your own people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from transporting theirs and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to ferry men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could probably conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes begin to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often tended by goatherds who were usually children or teenagers, equivalent to the more widely known shepherds.
Battering rams were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to attain greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Wooden rail joints appeared quite early and were intended to hold railway tracks in place, but it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support on top.
This was a common method, but the iron created a greater damping effect on the wheels of the wooden wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first all-iron railways appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is common.
Evidence of bipedal locomotion has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the opportunity to live more sustainably, to be part of the environmental movement, and maybe to act actively to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a transient treatment, we need to find the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological achievements, and that the problems have grown because of overpopulation and wasteful living.
After its approval by Congress on July 4, the handwritten memo, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies, now known as Dunlap's Brochures, were published.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on July 8 on the exterior of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9; another arrived on August 10 in London.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know are still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one species of dinosaur survived to the present day.
They're not seen as dinosaurs by many people because they have feathers and the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs like T. rex.
Computers are now based on the management of information coded in a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can take only one or two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The most reliable sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical in the room.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term koreus is used officially by etymologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancients' familiarity with bedbugs, which were insects easily adapted to infest humans.
The insect killer and the bed bug are both scavengers, adapted to live in their host's nest or enclosure.
In the United States, about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
Two partners may decide that raising an infant is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they have.
These couples can work out an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The basic goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which basically drives most scientific inquiry.
But there is more to it than experimentation, and experiment is a test conducted to disprove one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and observing also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on scientific matters, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As the Greek intelligentsia lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, perpetually cycling even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hersey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase got phages, or microbes, to put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people looking for natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying ecosystem information.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about Borneo's orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and meet others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport everyone is connected to each other in some way and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a steady state that has supported the evolution of the human species for the last two million years.
Every person participates in society and uses a transportation system, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard on the same level.
Why do transportation systems provoke such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental to blame?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the flow of specific drivers and cars between two locations and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic density, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships have assisted in the preparation, design and operations of road network facilities.
The first animals to take to the air were insects, whose ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places from predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, Aristarchus reported that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the Solar System revolved around the Earth and the Sun (and even around other stars).
It makes sense, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest overall river on the planet, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
Twenty percent of the water that Earth's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the Giza pyramids in size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Man has been aware of the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in nature in crude form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle thought that everything was created by mixing one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
Mostly it looked like the 4 forms of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, air and plasma, although it still assumed that they change into new substances to form this presence.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are, of course, other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil, when it appeared, became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have become available, the pencil's place and usefulness have diminished.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to pick up a scalpel.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy cart rolling down a hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and this leads them to split if little or no pressure is applied to them.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories hold that individuals have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor model.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can occur when managers start mentoring their former peers: at one end of the spectrum they try to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and putting people before their responsibilities.
At the other end of the spectrum, one can become an outsider who feels that he or she must change everything the group has done and take ownership of it.
After all, the one ultimately responsible for a team's success or failure is the leader.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are built on the same principles of excellence as conventional teams, however there are small differences.
Virtual group members often act as a liaison with their immediate physical group.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
The existence of a truly "invisible group" (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of an imaginary group.
Everyone is introduced to the "invisible team" of management, which sets the standards for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing organizational capability learning? One of the goals for the practical application of organizational capability learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity are fostered when appropriate use is made of all available resources in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, management needs to create an environment for innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel's (2006) explanation of the continuous learning approach describes it as a method used to help organizations raise their level of performance.
Neurobiological evidence offers physical evidence for a theoretical study of intelligence, thereby narrowing the scope of research by making it more explicit.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is an aid to researchers and their study.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumours affect behaviour and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that man has never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely reminiscent of science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computer science that deals with adapting behavior, learning, and intelligence to a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include auditing, programming, responding to diagnostics and customer inquiries, but also handwriting recognition, speech recognition and facial recognition.
These are now separate principles, which focus on providing solutions to real problems of everyday life.
AI is now commonly employed in finance, healthcare, engineering, and the military, and is even inherent in various home computer software applications and cyber games.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom and very often a teacher would like to take their pupils to places where access by bus is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while in the classroom.
In fact, taking part in a field trip is also an important opportunity to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogging can also help improve student writing; while students' experience of blogging often begins with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to try his best to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Also, participating in blogs "forces students to become more understanding about the world around them". The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more than just what they learn in school in the morning.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their own positions in the context of other people's texts, as well as express their own perceptions on specific issues" (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with a wide range of galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and much more marks Ontario as the epitome of the Canadian character as perceived by foreigners.
Large areas even farther north are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in itself in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all of the islets are independently owned or of French origin, and are renowned for providing luxury seaside retreats.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the region and it spread largely as far as the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
It is surrounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every woman travelling should declare herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that customs that differ by culture can lead to acts that would be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to go behind them, hold their hand, etc.
Be firm when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, it's not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenids who named it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru I-Batiyya, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002 the city of Goma was devastated by the volcanic eruption of Mount Nyiragongo, which covered almost all the streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside of Goma should be considered in order to understand the situation of the ongoing conflicts in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and viewing programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Usually the price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, "Tibet" has acquired the metaphorical meaning of exotic, faraway country.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and having an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger because of the threat of desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from the other cities in the country, as it has mainly Arab air and not African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and lies on the border line of Mozambique at its easternmost point, Zimbabwe at its northernmost point, while its southern border is considered to be the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological interest areas each supporting different wildlife species.
It is one of South Africa's most notable landmarks and is referred to as the emblem of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance entrance fees for the park.
It may be advantageous for one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission either to selected South African parks or to all its national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is an attraction for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape has been likened to a shimmering bar graph highlighted by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is for the most part densely packed on dry land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists occupied, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest zone, stretching 80 km across mainland Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remnants of the majestic jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sunderbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres of which about one third is covered by water/marsh zones.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 caribou in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakhar/Bumtang depart between 06:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between regions are usually full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punaha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territories now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The colonization period, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament annually takes place in the last month of the year at the Las Cañitas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and points of sale of tickets for water polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out what methods of payment are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In summer, temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F) are common.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As placid as bison may seem, moose, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, but these animals are big, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 has been the official capital of Samoa.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the Tupua paramount chief Tamasese Lyaoloufi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbours, the most popular being in this area.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the borough of North Harbour) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most are even shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour of the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families with quite a variety of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia the thought of flat white coffee is foreign. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is thickened with cream rather than foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, box jellyfish have appeared near beaches and estuaries from October to April, occasionally being spotted in a different season.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not inhabit the sea, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures that travelers will have a place to stay by the time they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through an agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, arrangements for transport to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other travel documents (e.g. a visa).
However, any amendments or requests should first be referred to the travel agent and not sent directly to the hotel.
Regarding some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you should start early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music may end on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music will continue late into the night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as passing through ice creates terrible noises for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include time to stay in the city; those on the ship are not required to have a visa (see terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests; windows and clocks are absent, and exits are difficult to find.
Often there are special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep customers happy and on the premises.
However, drunkenness affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough friction and it is difficult to drive compared to bare asphalt.
During a blizzard it can snow so much that you are trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall, moisture or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries where traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and an attraction for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as the overland journey to visit stunning African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and basic equipment will help with good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A bush walk (also called a walking safari) consists of a hike of either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having done so in 1964.
If you've made arrangements for how you'll fly and where you'll stay for 2020 before it's announced that they'll be postponed, you may face a sticky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, where the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets is about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have irons and ironing machines available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas one minute of boiling water is sufficient, but in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter infectious animals that they are not accustomed to in parts of their own country.
Parasites spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, allergic reactions, carry poison, and spread infection.
Infectious diseases or wild animals that have the capacity to brutally injure or kill humans are not often classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping gives you the opportunity to buy goods in specific locations free of customs duties and excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save quite a bit of money, especially on such items as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, because it crosses many lonely country places.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: roads with steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on upstream and downstream sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) - and it is even more important to obey them strictly.
Yet, strangely, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other sections of the route, such as in the Wilds of Pennsylvania.
Germany's sweets are of high quality, while Bavaria's are as plentiful and varied as those of its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit desserts usually include apples, which are used to make desserts throughout the year, and cherries and plums, which appear in the summer.
A large number of German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The well-known cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you desire small but delicious pastries, try what are called berliner, fankuchen, or krupfen.
Curry consists of spices and seasonings, and is accompanied by foods of animal or vegetable origin.
Curry can be described as "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the inland parts of northern India and Pakistan, curries are mainly made with yogurt; in the south and other coastal parts of India, curries are mainly made with coconut juice.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But, if used without other adjectives, the term tends to denote food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, local Javanese cuisine offers a menu of lightly spiced dishes, with Javanese staples such as peanuts, chili, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and many aromatic spices.
The stirrups are used to support the rider's lower limbs and are held on the right and left sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, however they can pose safety challenges due to the possibilities of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but gets his foot caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him along the road as he runs.
To begin with, most riders have special shoes that have heels, soft soles, and relatively short bottoms.
Next, some of the saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by the rider while falling.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's primary climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America with a variety of large granite walls and boulders.
The peaks offer breathtaking views of the hills, and climbers from all over the world forge new routes along the endless walls.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire ski holidays to a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 B.C.!
Downhill skiing as a sport can be traced back to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational skiing club was formed in Australia by some Norwegians.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually does not include them, as the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a similar distance covered on foot.
Under ideal conditions you will be able to cover relatively longer distances than by walking - but very rarely will you develop the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on specially designed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, visiting several countries during a trip would require visa applications and multiple passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country in this respect.
While staying in this zone you are generally allowed to cross the border without going through passport control again.
By analogy, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen Member States, saving you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition by which to classify a processed product as an antique; some tax authorities define antiques as goods more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, as the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade goods can be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sami and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
Even by tradition, of course, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but some made a living from fishing, hunting, and other activities, using reindeer mainly as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sami work in modern commerce, and tourism is an important source of income in Sami land.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma people, the word 'gypsy' is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccuracies about Roma.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to travel advice, travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the guidelines of governments other than your own, even though their guidelines are designed for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different conditions than Europeans or Arabs.
The directives are merely an overview of domestic political developments.
The views presented are often brief, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term that includes any hazardous weather event with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur in all parts of the world and can be classified according to geographical, topographical or atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, torrential rain, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones.
Local and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include heavy snowfalls, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Those planning a trip to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environment training course" will likely turn up the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much greater detail, usually due to practical training.
A course will usually last 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid training and sometimes weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, but publications dealing with the war zone are few.
Those who travel and plan to have gender reassignment surgery in another country must make sure they have valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without stating gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-op transsexuals can't expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Surface currents are the returning currents from waves crashing on the beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, return flows are concentrated in some deeper parts where strong currents may be generated at great depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming to shore should be no more difficult than normal.
You try to target a spot you've never been trapped in before, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it might be better to wait to be rescued.
Return shock starts before culture shock (the honeymoon phase shortens), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adjusted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits that were part of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country need time to adjust.
Many may not anticipate the patience and understanding needed in travelers to return home.
One of the events that takes place in the area and is of great interest to children is the sound and light show of the pyramid.
You see the pyramids at night in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and traders, and the story of sound and light is just like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is both the backdrop and the narrator of a great story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island, home to the neighborhood of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone and Deception Islands, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula, which is surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains join at this point with the plateau, and then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In isolated places where there is no telephone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone does not replace the mobile phone in general because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used in shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as for missions using remote data and having voice communication needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It has particular appeal to school leavers as it allows them to take a gap year before starting university without jeopardising their education.
In several cases, taking a gap year abroad can increase your chances of progressing to higher education in your home country.
Tuition is usually required to enroll in such programs.
Finland is an ideal place for boat trips.In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" you will also find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The boat will not necessarily serve you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and the larger lakes do have enough size for any pleasure craft, smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national pastime for Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This can be compared with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand but is generally quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Almost all private Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat in the evening.
If you disembark in the city only via excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise lines include Berlin, Germany in their brochures; as shown on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a very frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and resentments about other things that a lot of people have.
For some individuals, understanding the workings of an aircraft and what happens during flight can help them overcome a phobia based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are paid handsomely for the speedy delivery of goods. Quite often, time is an important factor when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
The larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but there are problems on other routes and with smaller companies.
If they sent things by air freight, some flights may take days to clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role comes in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a bunch of money for the premium seat (or better yet, ask your airline to do it for you).
However, this comes at a cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no need even to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to spend a lot of money for the privilege of a quick and comfortable ride to their destination, and they charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, however, Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic democratic state that has been plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not officially recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have resumed, despite the fact that political negotiations have failed.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with almost 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a key meeting point for transportation.

Formal announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but informal disturbances are voiced by an automatic machine that has a range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are famous for their self-centeredness, rudeness and arrogance.

In the national park at Plitvice Lake there is a lush forest, with beech, spruce and fir trees while the flora is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable variety of plant communities due to different microclimates, different soils and different altitudes.
The place has a significant variety of animal and bird species.
Endangered animals, such as the European bear, the wolf, the eagle, the eagle owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie, are found here, as well as a variety of common animals.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers to the knees while the shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries have long skirts for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored ones, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this from the stock at the entrance but this particular garment is not washed after every use and therefore you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like the cuisines of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa Pab Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and various side dishes such as cheese, tuna etc.
The first letter in all nouns, as well as the word Sie (you), is always capitalized, even within the sentence.
Thus, a rule distinguishes verb forms from objects.
It could be argued that it makes reading easier, although writing is relatively complicated because of the need to discover whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Italian pronunciation has a relative ease, as the majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The basic letters that demand your attention are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.

However, those with a limited knowledge of Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough not to need to be studied separately.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not the problem it is today, they are often located in cities or on university campuses, and they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most present-day survey telescopes are large installations in isolated locations with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plum blossoms were the flower of the season.
The first cherry blossom festivals held in Japan were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other nobles belonging to his court.
