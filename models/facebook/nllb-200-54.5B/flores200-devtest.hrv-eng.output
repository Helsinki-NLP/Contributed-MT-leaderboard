This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a popular theory, but it allows for details that fossils don't usually provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper side of this animal's plumage was chestnut brown and the underside pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed fin called the rachis, but have other features of feathers - fin rays I and II - the researchers concluded that the fin probably evolved later than the fin ray.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or pointing, and the researchers say that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern shows adult plumage, not juvenile plumage.
Research has shown that despite being the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is part of the plumage of an adult bird, not chicken wings.

In France, voting is traditionally low-tech: voters are isolated in booths, where a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the chosen candidate is placed in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly regulated by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest to the absence of envelopes at the beginning of the voting period and to the fact that no envelopes have been added except those inserted by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the proceedings, and in the evening, under strict supervision, volunteers count the votes according to certain procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a tightrope over the publication of photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, which handles all criminal proceedings, has told reporters that it will not comment further until charges are laid.
The document will, according to leaked information, relate to a border dispute, which the Palestinians want to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed reportedly included the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
Experimental hunters for pest control would be under the strict supervision of park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program, as part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and park heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected to carry out the first shooting operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary election board in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited the CEP's earlier resignation as part of a package of measures toward new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
At times violent protests have triggered the postponement of elections that should have been held as early as 2011.
There have been some 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, causing six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional overheating incidents, which for the company ""is not serious"". "
"The department called Apple's delay of the report ""truly regrettable""".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management reports no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in his spare time.
His research has shown that when hormones are administered, they accelerate the maturation of a fetus's lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight data recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer stated: ""Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".""
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnells stated ""Luna was as weird as I was, if not weirder... I love her and will miss her... I hope she went to a better place".""
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to a proposal for Australia to become a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Twenty-nine percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have called his health into question.
He couldn't take painkillers because they're banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, had discovered the largest known prime number by January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets formed, especially the Earth, which collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year, and last month the governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He called the rumors ""political gossip and nonsense""".
He is widely expected to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow aircraft to shorten flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older radar-based technology, this system uses satellite technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport options will be organised and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley. Also, vehicle parking facilities and ground-level parking and public transport use will not be available.
Due to fears of transportation shortages, the possibility arose that the game would have to be moved indoors without fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved within just two generations, although the process was believed to take much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a newcomer from the finch family, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into planes.
"It can be very thin and adheres to other metals. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called ""painted manuscripts""".
It's called chemical pH, and you can use red cabbage juice as an indicator.
The brine changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ion (H for pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together and then compress them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle you and cause a cocoon to form.
At Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, every house had at least one flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the structures of mining towns in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and during Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where both men and women mingled in society.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call, then reflects it back down almost immediately.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and views.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world, but the biggest change was that the invention of the wheel made transportation much easier and faster.
It made possible the invention of the train, the automobile, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including house cats) eat much more abundant small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, that is, a special position occupied by one cat so that it does not have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion but is more like a series of unintelligible, shouted words.
The ocelots eat small animals they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds almost all the animals the ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and locate eating animals by scent, by sniffing out where prey has been moving on the ground.
They see very well in the dark with night vision and move very stealthily. and then jump the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, while crossing a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so a new population needs features or adaptations that are different from its previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it becomes less and less like another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, two populations will be so different in appearance that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and then take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw had over 70 sharp teeth along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth which meant it was no help to anyone who got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue, and its diet consisted of turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It attacked anything that got into the water; even huge dinosaurs like T. rex would not have been a match for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a number of unusual or unusual delicacies that included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and puffins.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on stools, while the rich men enjoyed communal meals reclining on their sides.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have contained ingredients that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia over the following centuries.
For example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, and cocoa were unknown, and no one in ancient Rome had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a primary temple that was viewed as a god's house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids took the form of towers, called ziggurats, that were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were counters open to the street; stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, wood was scarce and costly.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red, after being banished from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and named it.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
"Although each country was ""Scandinavian"", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence it said ""Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776"." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down".
No one knows for sure who wrote this large parchment document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches), but it is known that soon after it was made, it was rolled up for storage.
So it's likely that the inscription was added simply as a marker.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together - a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and refers to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of a society in a way.
City-states are the precursors of states, and civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the imprinting of culture, and its equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first established a weak central government consisting of only a congress with the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, with no state or judicial authority, relied on often uncooperative agencies to enforce all acts.
It also did not have the power to nullify tax laws and customs between states.
Amendments to the Treaty required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states did not take the central government seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with Germany, the second most successful team in the world and were champions at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
"Because it consists of a cluster of islands, Japan is often called an ""archipelago"" from the standpoint of geography".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing to the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southeastern Taiwan and initiates a transformation of aboriginal practices in grain production and employs Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they originally came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size before the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, it's the same ratio as the image sensor formats in digital cameras.
A little confusing is the fact that the 35-millimeter format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio expressed as prime integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are equal to or closest to this aspect ratio.
Often violated and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European nations with different languages and customs.
The powerful influence of Christianity affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be applied for the purpose of alleviating suffering and reducing poverty and that church funds exist specifically for that reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they are living up to that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral ships.
Since there was little interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, a pacifist and separatist attitude prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations were anxious to avoid a repetition of such atrocities.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from his former employer, Charles Batchelor, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each family in power was a recognizable dynasty.
Each dynasty was followed by an unstable era of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought among nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting for the top spot in the great palace of Xi'an.
The consequences are of a social and political nature, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to the ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, employment was made available to all men and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity to succeed.
The same was true of the army, for after the revolution, ranks were assigned on the basis of ability, not rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond the boundaries of his humdrum life. The cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) he visited to better reflect".
The cave that has survived throughout history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know for sure that it exists.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Pyramid of Cheops, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramid structures built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
"The Giza Plateau or ""Giza Necropolis"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The designation ""upstroke"" looks like a V and ""downstroke"" like a stapler or a square without a bottom".
The upstroke means to start from the top and push the bow, and the downstroke means to start from the fretboard (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A raised string usually produces a softer sound, while a lowered string is louder and more insistent.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that string markings are printed for musical reasons and should usually be adhered to.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister Elizabeth were forced by a crowd of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point, in front of the horrified queen, a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray much of the cost, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will form the core profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period of these events is usually called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological incentive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide network of roads does not pay for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership leads to more accidents on the road, which leads to the discovery of new techniques in health care to treat injuries.
In Romanticism there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time geography-related customs and cultures emerge that are consistent with the physical residence of the society, and are therefore superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from 400 AD to about 1100 AD.
The status deteriorated in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with silks and spices that had a higher value than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style was from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the greatest discoveries of the era, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses seeds indigenous to an ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the methods most often used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite examples of unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up, either as a result of neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse.
Such children are referred to as uncultured or feral.[1] Some feral children are captured by humans (most often their own parents).
Feral children may experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, and some reportedly lived alone in the wild.
If raised entirely by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within bodily limits) that are almost entirely similar to the behaviors of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not an educational method, but a support for individuals facing a new learning experience, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, much like the animated paperclip that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized into the software and is intended to examine, instruct and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner to solve on their own.
Children are placed in the foster care system for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing, and educational, but it is.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is committed to providing safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to fill any needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socializing"" are cited as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"When researching visitors' reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified ""personal engagement"" and ""continuing relationships"" as new motivational aspects".
The use of video has enabled important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a particular person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book The President's Speech, argues that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge its sincerity.
He suggested that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shifts variability between these two sources.
On the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans find it difficult to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
In fact, failure has serious consequences: stunted growth, poor nutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources were protein from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest raw.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also contain large amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors handled the ""protein intake question"" in much the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today".
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during a normal period of sleep and going back to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully awakening.
If you find yourself turning your alarm clock off in your sleep, you can move it to the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which makes you get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present, everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it's expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga stimulates kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates an awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, differences in systems, practices, and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and it was going to be fought by really empowered armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered Poland and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Transporting goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for large numbers of people and large quantities of goods to cross an ocean.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time denying the ability of an enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures and were tended by goatherds, usually children or adolescents.
Horse-drawn wagon tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden carriage tracks consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to move faster and to pull heavier loads than would have been possible on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
The sleepers were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails could be more efficient with iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of chariots.
Eventually, iron wheels replaced wooden ones, and the first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal gait appears in Australopithecus about 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, and Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements and we can even be activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
However, rather than seeking a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of these problems and counteract them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems associated with overpopulation and extravagant life-styles continue to mount.
After Congress passed the handwritten draft on July 4, which was signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printer.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made of what are now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap copies known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many characteristics of birds are similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the handling of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are general enough to preclude an immediate diagnosis.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look for special first-aid instructions on the label that apply to the poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the well-known bed bugs, insects that are very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Killer bugs and common bedbugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living quarters they live.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple may conclude that rearing a newborn is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
Such couples may choose to give up their child for adoption.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.
In addition to this method, experimentation, which is testing to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, questioning, and observation also guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclical stimuli, have been discovered in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The experiment performed by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments that indicated DNA in a radioactive phosphorus phage or radioactive sulfur phage protein.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline.
Only mutations in the sex cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work, passing by those whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the private car-based transportation system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy knocked the biosphere out of one of its stable states that had supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why are transportation systems the subject of so many complaints; why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
In order to better represent traffic flows, links between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them plenty of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the water lily.
Several thousand years ago Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were convinced otherwise - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 3,980 miles [6,387 km] long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the Giza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of much of the civil service, while Latin is often used in religious services.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they are all found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made of one or a mixture of more than four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized about them changing into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon may also exist.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close companion to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of modern writing methods, the pencil has lost its status and is used less and less.
People type messages on computer screens now, so they don't even need a sharpie.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works by taking energy to assemble a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no pushing.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner in the area of the lunar maria and thicker in the area of the highlands.
There could be more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and grow up.
These theories look at what causes some people to want what they want and what environmental events cause them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors may emerge when leaders begin to manage former colleagues.
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating authority, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person turns into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and do it his way.
The leader of the team is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often creates a gap between the leaders and the rest.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent a point of contact to the nearest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than classic team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which the local administration may not understand.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each member reports.
Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After the efficient consumption of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, an organization's process of collaborating to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process for meeting a customer need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, making the field narrower and much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior has been confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong sci-fi connotation, it forms a very important branch of information science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now widely used in business, medicine, construction, and the military because it is embedded in some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class, and often the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips, where students can tour museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual field trip sharing is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capitol, and every year the site changes, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of memorial.
Blogging can also improve a student's writing skills. When students start blogging, they often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience corrects them in most cases.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them". The need to pique an audience's interest inspires them to be imaginative and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their point of view in the context of others' writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's charming capital, and it offers an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond.
All these things make Ontario uniquely Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas farther north are very sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
In a population comparison that may surprise many, there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent in terms of plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam, which took root in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that women travelers say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, hold their hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is wrong regardless of cultural differences!).
Modern-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and in Phoenician, Roman, and Merenid times, it was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, the name Casablanca given to it by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as baked goods, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of trinkets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002 the lava flow from Nyiragongo volcano buried most of Goma's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be explored to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi), which normally costs about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Because of its relative inaccessibility, ""Timbuktu"" is used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands".
Although its prestige makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport, Timbuktu today is an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of sandstorms.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates during the filming of his PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the exact opposite of other cities in the country because it has more of a mixture of the Arab world than the African world.
Situated in northeastern South Africa, Kruger National Park (KNP) borders Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The 19,500-square-kilometer [19,500 sq mi] park is divided into 14 different ecozones, each home to a different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is regarded as a leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be helpful to buy a wild card that allows entry into certain parks in South Africa or into all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is a major hub for many tourists.
The display of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is like a shimmering bar graph, made more visible by the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on land reclaimed along the north coast.
The site was claimed by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 50 miles [80 km] from the coast into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps, they include some of the last sites of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 1,400 square miles [3,850 sq km], about one third of which is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart all day from the intercity bus station (across the river), but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro and Punakha.
A suspension bridge spans the Oyapock River between the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge opened to traffic in March 2017.
The commissioning of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous people in what is now eastern Paraguay, semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and the Payaguá, who made their living from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Encounters with the indigenous population in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadores gave birth to Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely retained its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentine national team and half the players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas
Smaller tournaments and matches are held at other times of the year.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches check the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and U.S. currency may be; check with the owner in advance to find out what is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures in the summer often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particular ""rainy"" or ""dry"" seasons: the amount of rainfall is generally the same throughout the year".
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to human visitors, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park guidelines, keep a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the Mau-led struggle for independence, during a peaceful gathering in the town, the assassination of Tupua Tamasese supreme leader Lealofi III occurred.
As Auckland's two harbours meet, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and many are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent Mission Bay and St. Heliers areas of central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a large array of shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is ""Number One"". The beer is not complex, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called ""Manta""".
There are many French wines you must try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more to your liking.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're apprehensive, bottled water is easy to find.
"The concept of a ""plain white"" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is an ""espresso"", a cappuccino has plenty of cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is on a par with Belgium, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of authorities, obey all signs, and heed safety warnings.
Sea wasps appear near beaches and estuaries north of the town of 1770 from October to April.
Sharks exist, but they often attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodations in advance relieves the traveler of the burden of knowing that he will have a place to stay when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have arrangements with certain hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed to get to your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals the vast majority of participants camp at the festival site and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you'll have to get there early to get a seat.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you are travelling in the northern Baltic in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin, as the passage through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are not required to have a visa (check terms).
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend.
They usually offer special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and in the facility.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy roads and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to trap you.
The visibility may also be reduced by snow falling or carried by wind, condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic is generally uninterrupted throughout the year.
A safari is probably Africa's greatest tourist attraction and the ultimate experience for many visitors.
In common usage, the term safari refers to a journey overland to see spectacular African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Certain animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to the car and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a ""bush walk"", ""mountain safari"" or ""walking safari"") consists of a walk lasting from several hours to several days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodations for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you could find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation rules had not been extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were due to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels will rent you an iron and an ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas one minute of boiling is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if in doubt, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in extreme cases, cause allergic reactions, transmit poison, or cause infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by brute force are not usually classified as plagues.
Buying in duty-free shops is an opportunity to obtain products exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can save considerable amounts of money, especially on alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, often passing through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to country roads, be prepared for steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The prescribed speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and strict adherence to the limit is more important than usual.
Interestingly, though, cell service is better here than on many other stretches of road, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite good and varied in Bavaria, as with the Austrians' southern neighbors.
Common pastries are made with fruit, such as apples, which are used year-round, and cherries and plums, which are used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want small but hearty bites, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
"Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be ""dry"" or ""wet""".
Yogurt is a common curry ingredient in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
But when used without further qualification, the term refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago and consists of a range of simply spiced dishes dominated by Javanese favourite flavours of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
There are steep footrests for the rider that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they also involve certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him if he tries to escape.
First, most riders wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup strap to release from the saddle if the rider pulls it backward during a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America because of its variety of large granite cliffs and boulders.
With breathtaking views from the summits, climbers from all over the world are constantly charting new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow slope using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many people known as ""ski lovers"" plan their annual vacations around skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational skiing club.
Backpacking and skiing: also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering although it does not usually involve them.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than by walking, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is made up of many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean applying for a visa and going through passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country individually, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There's no universal definition of an antique, but some tax authorities define an antique as goods more than 100 years old.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade items may be called antiques even though they were produced later from similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of income for the Sami people, and the culture associated with trade is also important to many people in other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer husbandry on a large scale.
Today, many Sami are involved in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sápmi.
"Although the word ""Gypsy"" is widely used, especially among non-Romani peoples, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma".
If the country you are travelling to appears on the list of countries for which an alert has been issued, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
You can consult with governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Tips are brief summaries of a country's political situation.
The views expressed are often brief, general, and oversimplified when compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
A storm is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, rainstorms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of severe weather in their area as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"If you do an Internet search with the keywords ""hostile territory course"", you'll find the address of a local company".
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first-aid lessons, and sometimes weapons training.
Many books and magazines deal with wilderness survival, but few cover war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness to issue gender-neutral (X) passports or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies from government to government.
