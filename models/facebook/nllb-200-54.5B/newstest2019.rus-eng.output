Named the number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to go to Donbass
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrey Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to "at least somehow replenish the units".
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing of units", Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians conscripted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the united forces (OOS).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to strengthening the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
U.S. authorities forced Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, the company he founded, at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain in a leadership position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $20 million and leave the post of chairman of the board of directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
The settlement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by stating that he had sufficient funds to buy out the company's shares and sued the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman who posted on Twitter that he wanted to buy Tesla stock at $420 a share, but never did.
The tweet sent the company's stock up almost 11%.
The British Foreign Secretary compared the EU to the Soviet Union and a prison .
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of holding its member states captive.
The diplomat made the statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, Hunt was commenting on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What has happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union didn't let anyone leave.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave will not diminish, it will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape", he said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Brexit negotiations had reached an impasse.
She was commenting on the outcome of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the Irish border remains an open question.
The president of South Korea who received mushrooms from North Korea was given two dogs
South Korean President Moon Jae-in received two puppies as a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after his visit to Pyongyang.
This is reported by Reuters, citing a representative of the administration of the South Korean president.
"During the summit, a pair of Phungsan dogs were offered as a gift.
They were received on Thursday", the agency reported.
The dogs are about a year old, and the North Korean side has donated several kilograms of food "to help them adapt".
The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which took place from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The Phunsan is a North Korean wolf breed named after a county in North Korea.
According to the agency, Moon is an animal lover and already has two dogs that were given to him by former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also gave his counterpart two tons of delicious matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered the mushrooms to be distributed to family members separated during the Korean War who have not yet been reunited with their loved ones in the DPRK.
Head of Altai village council stops hunger strike to defend residents ' interests
The MP said on his Facebook page that he stopped the hunger strike for several reasons.
The head of the village council stated that the situation had reached a dead end, the district administration did not respond to his demands, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization STPC promised to begin work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian village next week.
Also, the residents of the village council made and took a mass collective appeal to the governor of the Altai Territory, "concerning the current catastrophic situation".
Boronin himself reported that he felt normal, his duties as head during the hunger strike were performed in full.
As Boronin explained, Sibirsky and Rogulichny villages have centralized heat supply systems, which means that the authority to prepare them for winter should be performed by the administration of the Pervomaisky district.
However, no one has yet begun to do so.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of the company Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the settlements for the winter Boronin demanded "to immediately organize in the territory of the municipality a full-fledged independent site of the municipal economy with the corresponding staff units".
Named the new buildings in Moscow with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand housing units with an area of 30 square meters and a value of up to four million rubles were bought in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of these transactions were for two residential complexes, according to the Urbanus portal (available to Lenta.ru).

Telegram users complained about a glitch in the new version
iPhone users have complained of problems with the Telegram messenger after an update on September 28.
You can get a user 's phone number from their username .
The complaints relate to gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after updating, the app shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Representatives of the messenger responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic updates until the issue is resolved.
On April 13, Moscow's Tagansky District Court ruled in favor of Roskomnadzor's lawsuit against the blocking of the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the telecommunications companies began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a court order.
Telegram audience after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to step down as chairman of Tesla.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the Tesla board of directors.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to keep the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be collected from Tesla.
The money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur and one of the 50 richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine.
He is the CEO of SpaceX, Neuralink, and Tesla, and a co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over a tweet he posted about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to take Tesla private and buy back all of its stock at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 price tag was allegedly set "because of the significance of the number in marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the commission's co-director of security, Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Integrity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will show that I did not violate it in any way", he told CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts caused them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, because of which the sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Also, other plaintiffs noted that Elon Musk's careless statements led to sharp price fluctuations.
In September, Elon Musk was accused of stock fraud by the head of Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the SEC, he would have faced suspension from the company and even prison.
This was stated by former commission chairman Harvey Pitt to CNBC.
Musk is "a nice guy who can't run a car company".

The Russian Orthodox Church compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, head of the Department of External Church Relations (OECR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk on the reasons for the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church schism and its political implications
At a time when "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage", he said, renaming the church is like "putting a yellow six-pointed star on Jews" in Nazi Germany.
"This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this purpose", the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".
The UOC urged the exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: a sell-out, Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak, summing up the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the deputy chairman of the government shared his opinion about the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso" and evaluated the attendance of the Russian stage of "Formula-1".
The result of our meeting with automakers should be in the foreseeable future just the creation of a Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, "said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to incentivize our automakers to do that.
We were talking about plans up to 2024, but I don't think that's possible at this time.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next 10 years".
From 2012 to 2014, the "Marusya" team competed in "Formula 1" under a Russian license.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship of auto racing in the "Formula-1" class.
I know that in Russia there are fans of motor sports, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian team "Formula-1", he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we get a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared partly because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi".
The Sochi Autodrome is expected to sell out tomorrow.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at the qualification, the stands were almost full, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can tell you that revenue this year is up 72% from last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We're also preparing an action plan to increase the efficiency of the Sochi Autodrom's infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak did not avoid the main topic of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniil Kvyat to "Toro Rosso".
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister "Izvestia".
He's a racing driver of great promise.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian drivers will be able to take part in the peloton of "Formula-1".
Although the further fate of Sergey Sirotkin in the "Royal races" is still unknown.
His contract with Williams expires at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Russian Grand Prix.
Hopefully, next season our main pilots will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

His words are reported by Rostovgazeta.ru.
Why are we so hypocritical about celebrating success?

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced his groundbreaking discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the modern era of antibiotics, bringing worldwide fame and a Nobel Prize to Fleming.
Incidentally, extracting penicillin from molds was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, while suffering from a cold, he had sprayed some of his own nasal mucus on a petri dish - a glass container used to test bacteria - and a few days later found that the bacteria had been killed.
Almost as accidentally, he discovered penicillin.
Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding personalities in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to conquer many of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene, and others.
When Fleming visited the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote: "He did more to defeat fascism and liberate France than dozens of divisions".
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were interred in London's famous St. Paul's Cathedral.
Where, by the way, my wife and I were alerted to this by a talkative Russian-speaking guide.
A few years later, we saw a life-size statue of Alexander Fleming in a most unlikely place in the Spanish capital.
There, next to the main bullfighting arena, the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man who, they believed, had saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not for this reason at all.

Although rumors of their wedding had been circulating since April, the couple only officially tied the knot on September 29.
According to People magazine, the private ceremony took place at Paltrow's home on Long Island.

Google will pay Apple $9 billion to become the default search engine
The American company Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in Apple's Safari browser.
According to Business Insider, payments will grow to $12 billion next year.
Last year, Google paid three billion dollars for this option.

In early August, Apple became the first U.S. company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.
Earlier published reports show that the corporation's net profit in the third quarter increased by 32% compared to the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

Trump says he's "in love" with Kim Jong-un
Donald Trump joked that the leaders of the United States and North Korea had gone from being cruel to almost in love.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success in resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of annihilation, the leaders of the two countries have now mended their relationship to the point that they are almost in love, said the American president.
The White House recalled that he took from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so run down relations with North Korea that they couldn't even reach the country's leadership - they simply wouldn't pick up the phone.
Back then, the US and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also "tough" on Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
Now, however, their relationship has improved to the point that the leaders "have fallen in love".
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Pyongyang had recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and was closing military sites.
All of this is thanks to the work of his administration, the American president believes.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump praised Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and for taking steps to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.
After a serious deterioration in relations and mutual threats to use nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korea crisis.
As a result of the negotiations, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not undertake any legal obligations.
The positive outcomes of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
Meanwhile, other practical steps toward North Korea's denuclearization have stalled.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US sent several scenarios for disarmament to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them as "gangster-like".

Nitsoy urged to replace "Moscow language with Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called for ousting "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language" from Ukraine.
She proposes to do this with Ukrainian products - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught".
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of "Observer".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, Russian used to be widely used on television and radio, but it has practically disappeared from the public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nitsoy shared her experience of supporting the "Ukrainian language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a lawsuit against the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
When she didn't get what she wanted, Nitsoy threw change at her.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nitsoy stated that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
Even the Security Service of Ukraine could not escape the writer's wrath: when she came there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.
We had a man-to-man talk during the break, and it paid off.
"Ural" defender Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.

"It was such a difficult game, we had a serious conversation during the break, and it paid off: we scored two goals and didn't miss.
"You've missed a few games due to the injury you sustained earlier this month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you can last 90 minutes, you're good!
It felt good, actually.
Maybe I was saving a little energy at the end so nothing would happen.
And so, doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What do you think of the team atmosphere?"
"It's no secret that after a win, it's easier to recover and the mood in the team is good.
Now we've got a white streak where there used to be a black one.
We have to keep it up and make the fans happy".
"Did you miss the game while you were away?"
"I've missed you a little bit, because it's really unpleasant.
But again, thank you to the physical therapist and the doctors for getting me back on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
Everything else is secondary".

There were irregularities in the referendum in Macedonia.
Four incidents of electoral violations have been reported in the Republic of Macedonia in the referendum on the intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.

The ministry noted that all violations are being checked.
"The ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can exercise their constitutional right to express their will freely.
We urge citizens to abide by the laws and refrain from any violation of public order and peace and any violation of the secrecy of the ballot", the Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Citizens in Sunday's referendum are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum aims to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's name, which is the same as a northern Greek region.
The foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic during a ceremony on June 17 on the shores of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The treaty should not only resolve the long-standing dispute over the country's name, but also open the way for Skopje to join NATO and the EU.

The accusation was news to a Dagestani deputy .
The Soviet District Court of Makhachkala has detained for two months the deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of participating in a criminal community that issued disability for bribes.
Kommersant has learned details of the investigation materials that shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, contributed to the criminal activities of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the operational-search activities conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
Recall that earlier the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise under his command, was initiated a criminal case under Art. 210 (creation of a criminal community using official position and participation in it), Art. 290 (taking a bribe by an organized group), Art. 292 (official forgery) and Art. 159 (fraud in especially large size) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the investigation materials, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in embezzlement of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities, joining the criminal community.
Being the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Dagestan and having connections in state authorities and law enforcement structures, as well as using his kinship relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators believe, "supported the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his position as head of the Federal State Institution "Head Bureau of Medical-Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan", organized the illegal establishment of disabilities to citizens".
After the announcement of this information at the meeting of the Soviet district court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I am being accused of today is new to me", he said.
The court arrested the deputy from "United Russia" not for ten days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestani officials, but for two months at once, since Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation appears in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigators have much more time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

It is specified that the HPP is located on the territory of Kosovo, but it belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize it.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiating on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more muted", the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which on this account spoke quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the theme of Russia in a negative way was practically absent".
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British now, in any case, the chorus was not entirely accurate", the politician said, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall against which tennis ball strikes are practiced".
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, two, three".
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point", Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's involvement can move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, Iran and North Korea as examples.
"So far, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", the parliamentarian added.
This is due, he believes, to the emergence of "an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - but an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time".
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that somewhere we are passing a point beyond which the movement will not be a movement backwards, it will be a movement forward", he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "the request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different", said the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to an obvious lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration".
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious", Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Damascus has declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that it will not have to use military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said.
However, according to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawing militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in case of Kurdish separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were going well until they were interrupted by the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone by October 15 along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry has taken over the Chelsea youth team.
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating a move to Spartak Moscow.

According to the source, the famous player, who played for a long time in the London club, will lead the team not older than 23 years.

First Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who was convicted in Russia for "espionage", for not being able to release him from prison until now.
She said this in a video address to a political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Sushchenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, a hunger strike is currently taking place outside the Russian embassy in Paris to demand the release of Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, go on hunger strike in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one demand - release of Oleg, release of Roman, release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us "harsher, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
Recall that Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
Russian prison guards granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with cancer.
Unfortunately, the disease does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer give hope to many patients.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
Years ago, he received a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a death sentence.
"I felt as if someone had hit me on the back of the head with a hammer.
I fell down.
I lost my bearings.
Put him in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I kept falling down.
They ran some tests, and it's bad. The artery's not letting blood through.
I was taken to Moscow, where they told me I had a large, pus-filled cyst in my head, and they operated on me immediately.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", Kikabidze said in the program "Once".
The tumor was malignant.
Back then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi residents even came to the doorstep of their idol to bid him farewell.
But the actor's wife did not allow the actor to be buried alive, she firmly believed that she could cope with the disease and did not leave her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock", admitted the actor.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
From time to time, he denies rumors about his illness and untimely death, which are constantly appearing online.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" have added Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto to the "Purgatory" section.
The pretext was "an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the Foreign Minister of the neighboring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion into Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participating "in organizing a provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
It should be noted that the governor of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, Pavel, and the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), Onufry, were pleased with Siyarto in the "Purgatory".
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian Local Church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities called the amount of the "golden parachute" Voronezh Deputy Governor
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On state positions".
At the same time, the real amount of the "golden parachute" of the dismissed acting official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
This was reported by the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary of Agibalov's position is 11 189 rubles.
Thus, the press service stressed, the amount of the one-time payment amounted to 223 892 rubles after deduction of income tax, not 1 million rubles, which the media wrote about.
The official has been receiving an old-age pension since July 2018.
He has more than nine years of experience in public service.
This pension and lump-sum payment are assigned to him immediately after his dismissal from office, the regional government explained to RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the payment of Agibalov's pension supplement was suspended upon his appointment to a state position, and the size of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
Acting Governor of the region Alexander Gusev, who won the gubernatorial election, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was relieved of his duties in connection with the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public positions in the region ended.
On September 29, the Telegram channel "Nezygar" published documents showing that Agibalov, who resigned from the post of vice-governor, was paid a severance allowance in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days later he again received a similar position without the prefix "vriyo".
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of first deputy chairman of the committee on education and science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that harmful information found on the Internet encourages teenagers to masturbate.
The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":
As part of the overall sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the harm, because there is a definite risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the puberty of children occurs early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the ability to officially engage in intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "hypocrisy", silence about "problems of sexual age" and the lack of culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor believes that masturbation is common among teenagers.
The deputy believes that lessons on the dangers of masturbation should be taught primarily in schools in "hyper-urbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood, to put it mildly", the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko - current academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Honored doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the presidium of the all-Russian public organization "League of Health of the Nation".

The AfD is now the second most popular party in Germany.
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is hitting another record high, and Angela Merkel's approval ratings are plummeting.
Apparently, Germans have grown weary of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a welcome destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent opinion polls, which show the rise of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party and the decline of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer.
This week, the AfD broke another record by climbing to second place in the popularity ratings.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popular vote, have managed to overtake the social democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one percentage point gap can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is important to note that the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists, has become a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings is still held by the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a downward trend - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent less than last year.
Following the Social Democrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The evolution of the Alternative
The party "Alternative for Germany" was created in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013", which included immigrants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group was initially opposed to the government's policies, but initially focused on economic issues, including the euro and the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsoring" of the EU's weak economies, did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the country's full exit from the European Union.
Amid the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party, which occupied the niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two Alternative for Germany representatives won seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist calling Ukrainians a "nation of morons" has been published
Ostap Drozdov, a political talk show host on Ukrainian TV and author of two books, admitted on live TV that he considers his countrymen a "nation of morons".
They watch too much TV and don't read enough.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We are not taught from childhood to read and accept texts", the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians have created a car for the apocalypse - magazine behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is now accepting applications for its new armoured vehicle.
Armored vehicle of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
It's not just video game companies, movie studios, and book publishers that make money from the apocalypse.
Now automobile companies are making inroads into new markets.
For example, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions introduced its Senator APC armored apocalypse vehicle.
In their spare time, the company's engineers design armoured cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who without much comfort, but in complete safety are placed in an all-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or what you might call a bunker because it's armored to the B7 standard, is mounted on the chassis of a Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenades and antipersonnel mines.
Interior of the Roshel Senator APC armored apocalypse vehicle
To prevent passengers from being injured even by the blast wave from a shell that exploded near the car, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire suppression system.
The Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a night vision all-round camera system and an armoured observation tower on the roof.
There's no weapon in the vehicle.
Front of the cab of the Roshel Senator APC armored apocalypse vehicle
To prevent the weight of the armored vehicle from affecting its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower 6.7-liter turbodiesel engine, all power is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There's no chance of getting stuck anywhere near the Roshel Senator APC.
The Roshel Senator APC apocalypse vehicle will be on display at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C. in October.
Named the date of death of the Universe
The universe will last about 140 billion years, ten times longer than the age of the observable universe, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The research by an international team of scientists has been uploaded to the arXiv.org preprint library and submitted for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
This conclusion was reached after researchers used the Subaru Telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) to observe some ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter) estimated the expansion rate of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data from the European Planck space telescope have clarified the limitations imposed on ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible end of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new evidence that the observable universe would end in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the pension referendum failed .
The opportunity to know the people 's opinion about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely .
A meeting of the federal initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, who registered different formulations of questions (the CEC registered five formulations in total).
They decided to apply to the Central Election Commission with a petition to register a single initiative group and ask Russians the question: "Are you in favor of not raising the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to receive an old-age pension as of July 1, 2018?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally capacious.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups joined them - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told "Vedomosti" that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".
Blues singer Otis Rush has died.

Our opponent fought well and gave us a lot of trouble.
I'm glad we had a good majority today.
Like I said, the goals will come, we just have to work for it.
And the fact that we won is also very important".
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this particular episode?"
"We have our own program that he's working on.
Therefore, such a decision was made", the club's press service quotes Bilaletdinov's words.

In the match "Loco" - "Ahmat" Turbin's mistakes rained down like a cornucopia
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Locomotive" - "Ahmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Locomotive" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unsuitability to officiate matches of the Russian Premier League.
I'm surprised that during the fifth round match "Spartacus" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of DSI did not draw serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not take long to show in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private omissions of rough tricks poured out like a cornucopia.
For example, in the 50th minute, the defender of "Ahmat" Rodolfo knocks down the railwayman Eder with his hands in his penalty area.
Eight meters from the goal, but Turbin doesn't give a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idov, which was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe there was deliberate handball by the defender in his own penalty area.
Turbin was near the scene, and his first assistant on the right has a good view.
This moment was supposed to be witnessed by reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three overslept and a penalty was not awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sporting justice was violated.
This was the moment when the notion of refereeing replaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight with Kryhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard seed?
- At this point, Turbin's first yellow card was irrelevant.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing, that some teams get penalties for such violations, as in the episode with Idova, and some do not.
What do you think of the footballer's words?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
It was a penalty.
They didn't.
So the referee doesn't give a second penalty to the opposing goal.
Here's the principle that's used.
And the second point of the double standard is that the referee looks at who's playing.
"Lokomotiv" played on Saturday and "Ahmat" has serious complaints about Turbin's work because the team was wronged.
Matt Damon played the accused rapist Judge Kavanaugh at the SNL premiere.
American actor Matt Damon plays U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of NBC's Saturday Night Live.
In a short sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee previously drew attention for his emotional and detailed accounts of his conversations with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
For example, Kavanaugh has repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but has stated that he has never drunk himself into a stupor.
In addition, in an attempt to clear himself of the rape charge, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
Those were also Damon's moments.
All I did was drink a lot and never think about sex.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everybody knows that", said Acting Judge Matt Damon.
Earlier today, Kavanaugh was elected to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Barbra Streisand has discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs.
American singer Barbra Streisand has claimed that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently from the original pet.
"They don't look like each other.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul", said the 76-year-old singer.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Tulear named Samantha, who had to be euthanized due to health issues.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua named Miracle Milly, dubbed the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Scientists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so tiny.
The United States is considering a naval blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies .
The U.S. could launch a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
American authorities are so eager to succeed in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke spoke the day before of the possibility of a naval blockade.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior performs not police, but civil functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was fully within the competence of his department, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industry event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said the U.S. Navy controls the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From Zinke's words, it followed that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The Secretary made it clear that the U.S. still expects to secure its leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this, Washington will have to squeeze Russia and Iran, and a naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke believes.
The Kalmyk director got good reviews at the festival
Our compatriot, actor of "Gogol-center" Evgeny Sangajiev and his film "Harmony" ("Harmony") were awarded a special mention by the jury members of the sixth festival of debuts "Movement", which took place in Omsk.
The name of the festival diploma indicates that "this is a signal for immediate reaction of major industrial players of spectator cinema".

He is young, talented, creative and in his work he strives for new non-standard forms of self-expression.

Supersonic passenger aircraft will be mass-produced in Russia
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the general director of the Central Aerodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky Kirill Sypala.
According to him, the research center conducts work on supersonic topics both within international consortiums and in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"Our feeling is that it will take two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10 to 15 years to get a production vehicle that will allow us to carry out transportation throughout our homeland", Sypala added.
He clarified that now Russian specialists are faced with the question of how to make the equipment economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the developer of aviation technology PJSC "Tupolev" announced the completion of pre-design work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to develop a speed of up to 1900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.

He stated that he could only confirm the words of the Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin's aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.

It was Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, joining the EU was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.

Putin", said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr Putin, for making my country much more European and much more prepared to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire", the President of Ukraine emphasized.

Formula One Grand Prix of Russia
There's a club in Russia I'm following.
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry talks about why he attended the ninth round match of the Russian championship Spartak - Rostov (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I've been following him for a while now, and it's been interesting to see him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a Chelsea fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologise again for my decision", Terry was quoted as saying by the Chelsea fans' website.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points climbed to third place in the standings, and "Spartacus" is located on the fifth line, with 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red-and-white will play with Yenisei on October 7, and the wards of Valery Karpin will take Orenburg a day earlier.
An expensive violin was pawned for a song .
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan in Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnbroker offered only $50 for what looked like an old, unpresentable instrument.
But experienced shop manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive instrument, and he consulted an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
The violin bows alone are valued at $16,000 to $18,000.
Investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the city and returned to its rightful owner.
It's unclear how the violin ended up in the hands of the man who pawned it, but he had no previous run-ins with the law.
The manager says that from now on, anyone bringing a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPL we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: "Spartacus" will receive "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, is not alien to the "people's team".
What makes this meeting especially interesting is that the clubs now have the same number of points - 15 each, and they share the 3rd and 4th places in the tournament table, lagging far behind "Zenit" and being one point behind "Krasnodar", which tomorrow plays with "Dynamo".
The red-and-whites are having a difficult time: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly flew into Rapid, and recently lost at home to Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartacus" with a minimum score and not without difficulty defeated "Chernomorets" in the Cup, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia is close to getting out of the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but it has not lost for five matches.
Let's see if Carpin can extend his unbeaten streak with a game of this magnitude.
The previous meeting of the Carpathian "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia shaken by powerful tsunami aftershocks
In Indonesia, where a few days ago an earthquake triggered a ten-foot-high [3 m] tsunami, meteorologists are observing more than 170 aftershocks.
The earthquake measured 7.4 on the Richter scale and mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, reports the TV channel "Russia 24".
More than 420 people died, and more than 500 were injured.
Authorities issued a tsunami warning in advance but later canceled it.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect the wave coming.
The fate of dozens of other residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of Palu's most devastated waterfronts is still unknown.
London has lashed out at Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.
But Britain will defend its values, he stressed in a speech to the ruling Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in gray areas with cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of these is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such claims by Western politicians, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would pay a heavy price if it broke international rules and used chemical weapons.
Hunt referred to the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year of former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on whether to join the EU and NATO if its name is changed.
The referendum is aimed at resolving a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with that of a nearby Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic North Macedonia.
Preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
Jan Petersen, head of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews how the observers' work is organized:
Approximately 100 teams have been dispatched across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drawing up of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country to monitor the preparations for the vote, the work of the media, compliance with the law on financing election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely following the elections.
Teams of observers record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of the election commissions to then present them in a final report".
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
This was reported by professional simultaneous interpreter Berbel Sachse on September 30, International Translation Day.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things quietly, but the Russians, as the saying goes, 'Saddle long and ride fast.'"
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of a translator this does not play a significant role", the expert said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, "knowledge of history is enough" to understand that the two countries need each other.
And in the future, Sachse noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny", she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to "establish relations" with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin's mania.

"Between Two Seas" won the Golden Shell at the San Sebastian Film Festival

The director of the same film, Benjamin Neistat, won Best Director.
The comedy "School Night" has topped the American box office.
The comedy "School Night", which debuted in U.S. theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its opening weekend.
This result allowed the uncomplicated picture starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the US box office for September 28-30.
On the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million, including $2 million from UK audiences.
In the fight for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable, quite significantly outstripped another newcomer to the Western rental - the cartoon "Smallfoot", a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
Directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig, the project grossed $23 million in its opening weekend, generally exceeding the expectations of experts who predicted $20-25 million for the weekend.
As for the total collections of "Smallfoot", at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (at the same time he debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the film's treasury by 3.6 million.
The three strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "The Mystery of the House with a Clock" from the master of horror Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director knows how to make a quality movie for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellairs' book starring the charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.8 million.
Despite being out of the top 3, the thriller "Simple Request" with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick continues to surprise with a "+" sign: for 17 days in the American box office, Paul Fig's film, from which some unrealistic financial achievements were not expected from the word "completely", collected $ 43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has a total revenue of 62.9 million.
The final representative of the top five this week was the horror film "The Nun's Curse", which collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-off "The Conjuring" after 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has on its account $330 million in total earnings and recently proudly bears the title of the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "Conjuring" and two tapes about the creepy doll Annabel.
Right behind Corinne Hardy's horror film this weekend is another newcomer to the genre, Hellfest, one of the top teen horror films of the year.
In its opening weekend, the brainchild of renowned editor (and more recently director) Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a number of big horror projects, including "Happy Death Day", to which "Hellfest" is in places very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Considering the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh place went to "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which does not seem to think about falling out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for the seventh week, is the sixth in the ranking of the highest grossing films of the genre in history with a figure of 165.7 million.
That 's how much the film has earned domestically so far - $ 218.8 million .
As for the last three lucky winners in the top ten in the United States for September 28-30, they were "Predator", "White Boy Rick" and... "Crimson Mint", which earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million respectively last weekend.
We should add that next weekend, the long-awaited "Venom" with Tom Hardy will be in full swing in the United States, which - we can be sure of this - will easily take the lead in the American box office on the first weekend of October.
Next week's other premieres include Bradley Cooper's Venice Film Festival-winning musical melodrama A Star Is Born and the crime drama Your Hate.

Head coach of "Vityaz" Valery Belov - about the defeat from "Siberia" (3:4) in the regular championship match of the KHL.
"My colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to mention our fans", the official website of Vityaz quotes Belov's words.
"I hope they'll be supportive too, because now almost every game is a full stadium, great atmosphere.
In terms of the game, God must have helped Siberia today, because they've made some big mistakes, especially our leaders.
In fact, we lost the micro-match 0-3 to our leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull this match, although there were moments.
But I'll take the blame anyway.
Because you obviously missed something in the preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team".
"This is an ugly nepotism".
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "The Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "gross nepotism and brazen cheating".
When at the blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But his son's feelings got the better of him, and he chose a relative to be on his team.
At the time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the mentor for being biased in the first round.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the cronyism the ugly and open dragging of their close relatives to the final stairs.
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end to the first place", - argued Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "leaked" wonderful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not so, the audience wants an objective assessment and to see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"My sympathies to the Agutin team on The Voice - they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show how professional he is".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"If you remove two talented people from the project and keep your dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you call him a mentor?"
"You like the way Dad sings, organize a concert for him in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people will come to this concert".
This is The Voice, not Cool Relatives.
"It was unprofessional of Agutin".
"Then you should have your own show and ask your dad to be on it, not a show that Channel 1 is paying for".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should resonate with me more than any other contestant with actual vocal ability.
Why was a worker from Surgut with a great voice and timbre eliminated, and Dad Agutin got to the final?
And then we all complain about the same faces on stage and screen for decades!
Because you can't break through nepotism!"
"What did you expect?
This is Russia!
Round tables and cronyism.
Besides, it'll be a nice addition to the family budget.
The theater of the absurd continues!"
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice", Gradsky's son appeared at the blind auditions.
It never occurred to the mayor to put his son on his own team.
In fact, he said, "Go on, get out of here, it's all right".
Agutin could not act like a professional.

The innovation will help those who have decided to buy an apartment in a new building, but are afraid of the developer's bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to the amendments to the law on shared construction, developers will have to borrow fully from the bank.
And many experts are already talking about the possibility of a sharp rise in the price of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on Ivan Kudri Street, the capital's police reported.

The scientist told about the possible scientific program of the Russian expedition to the moon
The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is developing directions for such work.
"There is no consensus yet", he stressed.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon to avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic radio sources", Petrukovich added.
He also thinks the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
It could help us determine how life emerges on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the Moon by 2030.
A disgruntled customer dumped a basket of feces at a 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, reportedly had a grudge against the manager of a 7-Eleven convenience store when he was fired in May for inappropriate behavior.
So he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At 1:30 a.m., he entered the store and emptied the contents of his shopping basket on the floor and on some of the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine that Simms had "borrowed" from a nearby portable toilet.
The police arrived at the scene and arrested the "avenger".
He was booked into jail and released pending trial on $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal mischief, and banned from entering the store and approaching the manager.
While Simms' crime may seem more ridiculous than serious, the sentence could be severe, as he has a history of grand larceny, robbery, unlawful possession of a weapon, driving while intoxicated, and cruelty to animals.

The SBU identified and detained the owner of a Peugeot-301 car, which the day before was driving around the capital with license plates of the so-called "DPR".
He turned out to be a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who currently works as an agent of one of the insurance companies of Ukraine.

This was stated by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industry event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that the only source of income for the Russian economy is the sale of energy and that Moscow is pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, writes Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that a similar situation exists with Iran.
To solve it, according to the minister, there are two options for the development of events: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the first, so we need to pressure and displace Iran's energy resources.

There was nothing I could do, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
Russian Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix.
"Honestly, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I was caught between two cars, and they were right behind me.
I lost all the positions I'd gained at the start, instantly, immediately.
He's in a very bad position.
I got stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others stopped, we'd get some fresh air and get back up to speed, but we ran out of rubber.
Plus, he fought with his partner, had contact with him, too.
I understand he's a little confused.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most difficult track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore", RIA Novosti quoted Sirotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was the British driver of "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the base of "Spartacus"
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of Moscow "Spartak" players Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yeshchenko from training with the main squad after liking the criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
Paying attention to things like that is the stupidest thing in the world.
I don't agree with what Carrera is doing at all.
It only deepens the rift in the team.
First of all, it's poetry, and you can read it any way you want.
If I were Carrera, I wouldn't react to that.
Everybody's got an opinion.
Second of all, everybody wants to look good.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko like it, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility of perception.
And it's not conducive to a healthy team environment.
Spartak has no game today, so there was no need to inflate the situation.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
There's a lot wrong with Spartak's different lines, a lack of play after the introduction of the youth team.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match, "Tarpishchev is sure.
The match between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously turned down Spartak, took charge of Chelsea's youth team.
"Sirius" students discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The researchers' presentation was part of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as the driving force of civilization development.
The scientist's lecture was published on the Sirius website.
The students learned that modern technology consumes a tremendous amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, nature-like technologies that young scientists are working on today will help.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of this kind of technology is a unique thing, it's a tremendous boon.
It's the explosion of medical technology, it's the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a flip side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually the technological reproduction of the systems of living nature.
There's a flip side, which is deliberate interference with a person's life.
There are always risks.
When the automobile came along, people started dying under its wheels.
But cars are still being used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction", REN TV quotes the scientist.
After watching the film and discussing current scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting participants.
The speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-nature-like technologies of the National Research Center "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
Educational center "Sirius" in Sochi was created by the educational foundation "Talent and success" on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and support gifted children at an early stage.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security "Cyber Challenge" will be sent to study at "Sirius".

The Russian submarine "Kazan" scared the United States
The greatest threat to the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
This was stated by the American Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, reports "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.
"We are facing a formidable potential adversary.
It is enough to look at the "Severodvinsk"", he said, pointing to the model-predecessor of "Kazan".

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was called to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to change the name of the Balkan country to "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians' use of the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic a path to NATO and later the EU.
However, according to the EFE news agency, only 34% of voters in Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a proponent of changing the republic's name, said that if the "yes" vote prevailed, Macedonia would change its name despite the lack of a quorum.

Kemerovo residents were outraged by a flock of sheep at the cemetery
On September 30, a well-known Kemerovo social network page posted a report from an eyewitness that horned animals were roaming freely in one of the local cemeteries.
A large herd of animals moved between the fences and pulled up the grass.
Commenters had mixed opinions: one local resident noted that the presence of small cattle in the cemetery is not harmful, and their appetite may even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the city's residents did not like the animals' behavior:
"These are graves, not pastures.
It's no place for sheep.
About sheep, of course, you can't say that they blaspheme, but it's not about that". (style preserved) - an outraged woman from Kemerovo noted in her message.
Anyway, one of the witnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known and necessary measures will be taken soon.
What's the right way to push and shove?
There's no such word as overwhelming.
That's right.
The word "push" in the sense of "pull, influence, impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "push".
We use this word thinking it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "push" are etymologically not only different, but in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To suffice (church-book, obsolete) - means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Contentment and pleasure are related words.
It used to mean "independent, self-sufficient" or "self-sufficient".
Old Slavonic "dovl<unk>ti" is related to the words "command" and "will".
It's one thing to push, quite another to suppress.
These words have some truly frightening cognates: daos means "wolf" (to crush sheep), deyja means "to die", and dvaidī means "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "pressure", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this same "d[a]vlet", which is also used in writing through "a", which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So the right thing to do is to push.
But it's an old-fashioned word, no longer used in its proper sense.
If you want to indicate that some circumstances/people are exerting a negative influence on you from above, use the word "push".
You can also use the pressure construct, but remember, this is a clerical error.

Russia has protected itself from terrorists with its operation in Syria .
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was announced by Viktor Bondarev, former commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of airborne weapons: The Aerospace Forces have carried out and continue to carry out all strikes precisely on terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria over the past three years, including ammunition depots, fortified areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was broken - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed us to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand fighters from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of ISIS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant borders - otherwise this evil "would rush to us".

These killings are war crimes under international law", he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists" because the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and implied "sowing chaos, death and destruction on their way".
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to cleanse Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev 's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of the Nazis
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis against the Jews.
"It's like putting a yellow star on a Jew in Nazi Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this purpose", the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 television channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "put it outside the law", the priest believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of draft laws No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow patriarchate.
The head of the Pochayiv Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy sites
The deputy of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, appealed to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
At various times in history, our ancestors and fellow Christians had to confess their faith and defend their holy sites.
Given the situation that has developed, and the information we have, and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something", the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral support.
The abbot also emphasized that "your physical presence will probably be required".
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, are threatening reprisals, and therefore we will defend our sanctuary".
Anyone who cares about the fate of the Pochayiv Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be ready to defend it, the appeal says.
The metropolitan urged not to follow the lead of those who mislead believers.
The UOC has a canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to impose dependence on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew of Rome.
The new style and its consequences are unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has", said the head of the monastery.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has the Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?" noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochayiv, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other confessions have a Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican.
To some extent, believers have worked out which temple they will attend.
However, there are those who would like to sow enmity and strife again.
Some are jealous of the shining domes of the churches they want to destroy", said the clergyman.
Pochayiv Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located on the top of the Pochayiv mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.

He decided to give all the money to charity.
If we keep playing the right way, the wins will come.

"It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal" - quotes Vorobyov's words the official website of "Automobile".
"We tried to keep it very simple.
I really enjoyed the first period.
Missed a few good moments.
In the second half, we got a little bit of a run on us, but we held on.
But the removals fed us a little.
The boys played great, followed the coach's instructions.
I think if we keep playing the right way, the wins will come.
No goals scored, no goals won, but the content of the game was right.
The luck will come if we keep playing in this direction".
"In your opinion, "Automobilist" has increased compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"At that time, there was no foreign link.
The preseason was a different ball game, a lot of young players.
I think it was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The Motorman is a good, solid team.
It's clear from the standings that the team is playing the right way.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team's moving in the right direction.
There's a lot of good players, there's leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was unbeaten, we wanted to change that, but we couldn't".

Macedonia's main opposition leader refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum is being held on Sunday, September 30, on the issue of an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), Hristijan Mickoski, said he would not vote in the referendum.
As party spokesman Naum Stoilkovski explained, Mickoski decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "harmful".
According to the press secretary, the current referendum is about changing the name of the country and nothing more, while the party's strategic goal is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov also refused to participate in the September 30 referendum.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov noted.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the country's name, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, TASS reminds.
A fire broke out in the restaurant of Istanbul's "meme chef"
Istanbul's Nusret restaurant, whose chef Nusret Gökçe has become famous for his steak-salting and meme-making, caught fire during a fireworks display, Sputnik reports.
According to preliminary data, the waiter mixed additives for meat steaks cooked on the fire.

Five people were reported to have suffered severe burns - two waiters and three Czech tourists.
At the same time, the Czech Foreign Ministry stated that only two Czech tourists were injured.
According to the embassy, the woman suffered burns on 35% of her body, the man - on 15%, writes "RIA Novosti".
We're talking about second-degree burns, and in the case of a woman, deep penetration of the skin.
Turkish chef Nusret Gokce is known on the internet for his sophisticated way of sprinkling steaks with salt and spices.
It was reported that he commissioned a large-scale PR campaign in different countries, in which Leonardo DiCaprio visited Nusret's restaurant in Dubai.
On April 1, a fire broke out in the Old Barn tavern in Kazan.
The fire engulfed the roof of a two-story building with an area of 450 square meters .
It was reported that the cause of the fire could have been a grease fire in the exhaust system during the preparation of the barbecue.
EU provides €1.5 million to help victims in Indonesia
The European Union (EU) has allocated €1.5 million to Indonesia to help with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami.
This was reported by the press service of the European Commission on September 30.
The European Commission has sent experts to the region to monitor the aid.
As noted, the funds will go to disinfection, as well as providing food, water, temporary shelters and medicines to the victims.
The Commission also provided the Indonesian authorities with access to Copernicus satellite maps to assess the damage.
The United States also expressed its readiness to assist in disaster relief, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The U.S. Embassy in Indonesia has also received no reports of U.S. citizens injured.
On 28 September, two powerful earthquakes of magnitude 7.2 and 7.4 occurred in Central Sulawesi.
By the morning of September 30, seismologists had recorded more than 170 aftershocks.
As a result, some parts of the island still lack transportation, electricity, and communications.
Strong aftershocks triggered a tsunami, with waves as high as 10 to 15 feet [3-5 m].
According to the latest figures, 832 people were killed and more than 540 were seriously injured.
In addition, at least 16 thousand local residents were forced to leave their homes, thousands of houses, hotels, shopping centers were destroyed.
More than 100 inmates in the Indonesian province of Central Sulawesi have escaped from prison.
The U.S. is comfortable with the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan.
There was a lot of talk in Tehran about the sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the country's civilian population.
This year was a record year for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans", - said Patrushev.
Afghanistan's woes did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month ago, America and its NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.
U.S. troops are behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
They're paying off the fighters as best they can to keep them out of trouble.
The Afghan government controls less than 40 percent of the country, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the movement "Taliban" (banned in Russia).
Another 10% - for terrorists of ISIS (banned in Russia).
But they're growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia -- exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with it.
It is also satisfying that in the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Huge increases in opium poppy cultivation and billions in profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO if the country's name is changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 after long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
And Greece will assert her right to her past.
There's no such thing as a perfect deal.
They arise from difficult compromises and cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
The conservative opposition and Georgi Ivanov, the country's president, are against it.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, there is no point in Macedonia joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev was imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole".
