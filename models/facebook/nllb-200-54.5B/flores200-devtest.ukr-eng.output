Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details that the fossil record could not - such as color and three-dimensional imagery.
Scientists claim that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but have other features of feathers, such as serrations and barbs, researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved much later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or for beauty. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chicken down.
The researchers speculated that although it was the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed adult plumage rather than juvenile down.
A car bomb exploded outside a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than two dozen others.

She is in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the testimony of any witness could be challenged as her photo has been widely published.
In other parts of the UK, this is common practice, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous path by publishing photos and other details of suspects".
The prosecutor's office, which is generally in charge of the prosecution, told reporters that it would not provide any further comment, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the conflict over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics likely to be covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands to maintain a military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
The hunters in the auxiliary pest control had to be carefully supervised by the rangers, as the hunt was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with UNRWA and the Australian Shooting Sport Association (ASSA), qualified volunteers were recruited through the ASSA's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Preservation for the NSPCC, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received proper safety briefings and training.
Yesterday Martelli was sworn in by the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEC) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous TVK as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.
Approximately 60 incidents of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 emergencies related to the devices.
Last week, the EPA announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting a "great misfortune".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six hostages are reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and joined Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the introduction of the hormone accelerates the embryonic development of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered two flight recorders (black boxes).
Fellow soldiers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna died on the night of two months. Pretty unique, like herself. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as devastated as I was...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place".
From 1,400 respondents before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agreed that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
Looking at the categorical responses to the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and take part in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, doubts were raised about his fitness.
He could not take painkillers, which are prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest known prime number.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various gadgets and software before the beginning of February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply, as well as organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He's rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the more outdated ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with maximum precision and provide pilots with detailed information.
No additional transport is running and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and intercept car parks will not be available on the surface.
Concerns about lack of transportation led to the idea of holding the game behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer due to the reproduction of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza koniorostris.
Gold can be made into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The acidity level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders by swirling them in a bowl and then roll them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, providing an unusual sensation and forming a kind of shell.
A toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system was in almost every home in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed companies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and what we see.
It takes a big rocket at least 100 feet high to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much easier and much faster.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Down below are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium prey - from rabbits to antelope and deer.
There are many small cats (particularly free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of the niche - the special position each cat occupies that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups called prides.
The pride includes one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave much like packs of wolves or dogs - animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and just as dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can leap (albeit not very skillfully), swim, jump great distances, and strike with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar but is more like a confused cry.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots stalk and track their prey by scent, searching for their scent on the ground.
Ocelots hunt their prey by hiding in the environment and then suddenly leaping out at their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often end up in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, different resources and different competitors, so the new species will need to develop new traits or become a stronger competitor than it was before.
The indigenous people have not changed at all - they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two populations will look so different that they won't be the same species.
This process is called speciation, the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants cook food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat comes from plants.
The Mosasaur was a top predator for its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 razor-sharp teeth along with their extra set on the palate, which meant that anyone who got in its way would not be able to escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could match it.
For the most part, the Romans ate what is familiar to us, but they also had their own strange and unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a wolverine.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men liked to have communal banquets where they rested on their sides while eating.
The diet of the ancient Romans did not include foods that would be brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a central temple, which they viewed as the dwelling of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers were built as part of temples, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were no longer so important.
Much of this Jewish family's life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
Forests in Canaan were sparse, and timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, however, it was already inhabited by Inuit tribes.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Despite what it says on the back, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
There is no information about its author, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence the document (it measures 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was kept in a rolled-up state.
Thus, it is likely that the inscription was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, it was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Fighting French forces liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture of a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", meaning "civil", which refers to the Latin word "civis", meaning "citizen", and "civitas", meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also defines the size of a society in a way.
City-states can be seen as the precursors of nations. Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a stable cultural footprint and an even distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, so they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress was its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the authority to impose taxes, and because of the lack of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state legislatures, which often did not cooperate to enforce all of its acts.
He also did not have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states did not take the central government seriously enough that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Well-known sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Geographically, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" because of the cluster/group of islands on which it is located.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opens a branch in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the world's most common still photographic image format is 35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has adopted the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APIES format family) equal or are very close to this proportion.
The often-used and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
According to him, the most efficient place to place the main object is the intersection of the lines that divide the raster into three thirds vertically and horizontally (see Example).
During this period in European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion held European nations together despite differences in language and culture.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should combat suffering and poverty, and church coffers are designed to do just that.
For more than a thousand years, the central authority of the church had been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church had lived up to its claim.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the blockade violated generally accepted international legal norms codified in several international treaties of the past two centuries, it cut off vital military and civilian supply routes.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent ships from entering certain parts of the ocean, creating a danger even for neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations.
Recognizing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations were determined to prevent such atrocities in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla moved to the United States to apply for a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were depicted in a unique way; each stage of the country's development was represented by a ruling family that became a great dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Sangyo Period, which lasted 60 years between the Jin and Han dynasties.
This was a time of bitter warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people killed in battles for the throne in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state is owned by the people rather than by a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all willing men, giving the most ambitious and talented the opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and he often retreated to the cave that became known as Hira, on Mount Nur (Light), to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it's there.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built to honor a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward bow mark looks like the letter "V" and the downward bow mark looks like a bracket or square without a bottom.
Up means you have to start at the head and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the foot (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while the downstroke is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to add your own markings in pencil, but note that the printed markings for stringed instruments have a meaning, so they usually need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the marketplace drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and four-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, out of Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved to the terrified queen the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The military expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay much of the costs and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Surplus profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be a major achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually covers a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or technological imperative to the idea that human destiny in a strict sense is dictated by underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely lies outside cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inevitable rather than socially determined.
For example, one could argue that a car necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unfeasible for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in the number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new methods in the field of health care for the treatment of injuries.
Romanticism carried with it a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography emerged, and they, being in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is famous for being an epicenter of luxury dating back to about 400 C.E. and lasting until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its situation deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing of the Orientals was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great achievements of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to button their clothes.
Non-commercial agriculture is agriculture whose purpose is to grow enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses the harvested seeds of native plants of a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel disregarded by societal standards and allow them to gain a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be defined by the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their identity through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion items, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take several stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, unhappiness or deliberate cruelty, and were not socialized by adults.
They are often kept in captivity by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the parents leave the children to their own devices because they do not accept the severe mental or physical disabilities of the latter.
It may be that feral children were abused or seriously injured before they were abandoned or ran away.
Some were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild alone.
An uncivilized child raised by animals behaves in much the same way (within physical limits) as the corresponding animal caretakers, such as treating humans with fear or indifference.
And while design technology is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather an aid provided to individuals learning new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher acts as a scaffold, like the little violin man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in the software are designed to ask, prompt, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to learn on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even violence.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are deprived of care, attention and nurturing, but they do.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide everything they need that was lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are cited as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Agee and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions - facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have this ability to interpret human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genotypic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reservoirs with each generation.
For primates with a digestive system like humans, it is difficult to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and beans, but they're hard for primates like us to digest if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only well digested but also provides a considerable amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all these things, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved the protein question in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Interrupted sleep is the process of purposefully waking up during a normal period of sleep and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can set it across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other variations based on biorhythms involve drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing one to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm that a person has is directly opposite to the level of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone has the capacity for enlightenment, and the only thing that can stop us from reaching that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened from yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, leading to the beginning of the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years, and there would be actual fighting between national armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans lost their relevance almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop the movement.
If the Allies failed, Germany could probably conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes bred them for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that moved over hills and other pastures and were tended by goatherds, often children or teenagers, better known as herders.
The first horse-drawn carriage was built in England in the 16th century.
And although horse-drawn carriages were essentially two parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that worked on them to develop greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more bumpy conventional roads of the day.
Sleepers were introduced to hold the rails in place quite early, however it gradually became clear that the rails would be more effective if iron fasteners were installed on top of them.
This became common practice, although iron caused more wear on wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first known movement was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago, with Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright, as is common.
Bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have started walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least do something to reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's just treating the symptoms, but if we're not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to get to the root of the problem and fix it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed dramatically as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of mankind's overpopulation and extravagant life-styles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, the handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150-200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
Dunlap's 25 posters are now known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurs.
In fact, all the computers we use today work by processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number system can have only one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer jargon these numbers are called binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicine or a toxic household chemical.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
From a formal point of view, entomologists describe this group of insects as beetles.
The term reflects a centuries-old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both cone beetles and bed bugs are nest-building insects adapted to live in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to have a child.
Such parents may decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents forfeit their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to learn by the scientific method how the world works, and this method really drives most scientific research.
While it is not just experimentation, an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more possible hypotheses; the attitude of asking and observing also guides scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often strongly influenced by the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic factors, are recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue a freely cycling period even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment became one of the main hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or labeling bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo and learning new information about them.
Every morning, people leave their small provincial towns in their cars to go to work, passing other people who work in the places they have just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth traffic, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science is now pointing out that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its steady state that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everybody lives in a society and uses transportation systems, and not everybody complains about them.
You don't often hear similar complaints in developed countries about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints and fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Road flow is the determination of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave quite coherently; thus, traffic flows usually have some logical sequence, and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These ratios help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Now the only insects that can't fold their wings are butterflies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the entire solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
And that makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes as much as six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed either in size or in the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the structures of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and also the least populated country.
In its legislation and official communication, the Vatican uses Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday communication for most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in native form, and they're fairly easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that will include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since its introduction.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the status and use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on a computer screen without ever having to go near a paper clip.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like when something newer is invented.
An atomic bomb works by taking energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and fission releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impetus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The top layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what they like.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been adopted by them in the process of growing up.
These theories involve certain people and what makes them want the things that they do, and what things in their environment make or don't make them do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers start managing their former colleagues.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable personality who feels like they have to change everything the team did and do it their way.
At the end of the day, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact with their immediate real-world group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet according to time zones that may be incomprehensible to their local managers.
The presence of a true "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual collective.
The Invisible Team is a management group to which all members report. The Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the process of the organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognitive abilities, thus narrowing the search area and making it more precise.
Scientists are supported in their studies by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, trauma and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The explosion of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important subset of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
In AI research, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become discrete disciplines focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the armed forces, as it has been embedded in several applications related to home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher will want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips where students can look at museum artifacts or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
The virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina annually create a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but its old versions are kept online as an album.
Blogging can also help improve a student's writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are almost always the most critical audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The need to satisfy the interest of the audience motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn well outside the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can inspire students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material from the Internet, students can identify their positions in the context of others' articles, as well as outline their own views on individual issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital, is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight in Ontario what outsiders consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that may surprise many: the United States has more African-Americans than Canada has citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and it's a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became firmly established in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around Europe's Cape of Good Hope to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female travelers are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may also be wise to wear an earring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can result in what you consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Firmly refuse men and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, this is not normal!).
The present city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
Completely destroyed by the Portuguese and then rebuilt and named Casa Branca, it was abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-i-Badiya, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Not far from the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a variety of trinkets, but these are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before any travel outside it is necessary to study the situation with the fighting still going on in the province of North Kivu.
It is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for one of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla treks.
To get around Goma you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Because of this, as well as its relative inaccessibility, the name "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has an airport and attracts tourists with its history.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stops during a PBS report on Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major landmarks and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, visitors are charged a daily fee for security and entrance.
It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which gives access to some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place of special interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the architectural face of Hong Kong has been compared to the glittering histogram revealed by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon on the opposite side of the harbor.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed in a tented area along the northern shore.
This is a site that was claimed by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps, for they include some of the last islands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water or swampland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakhar/Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese-made Koster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
A shuttle taxi is a quick and convenient means of travelling to nearby destinations such as Paro (150) and Punakha (200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge connecting the banks of the Oiapoque River and the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guinea.
The pylons are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes of traffic, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts will be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who sometimes engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, clashes between Spanish conquistadores and indigenous groups led to the creation of Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous features and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Ca√±itas.
Small tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
Check with the Argentine Polo Association for news on tournaments and venues for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and many establishments also accept Stanley credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British or United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30¬∞C] are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild, so they do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to park guidelines, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As tame as they may seem, bison, red deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so take along and do not cook food with odors, and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor became the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the assassination of the Tupu paramount chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's location between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific coast and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located in WaitematƒÅ Bay, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family-friendly, sometimes crowded beaches with lots of shops along the coast.
The main local beer, Number One, is simple but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines can be tasted, but New Zealand or Australian wines may fare better in transit.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of flat white coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. Short black is an espresso, cappuccino is made with bitter cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
This hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices aren't cheap, but they're delicious.
Many trips to the reef occur year-round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay special attention to hazard warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not spend much time in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often work with specific hotels, although you can try to book other accommodation with them, such as a campsite.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airfare and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your trip (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be made through the travel agency, not directly through the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music event attendees choose to stay overnight, and for most attendees this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a seat closer to the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has stopped, there may be sections of the festival that will play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in the winter, pay attention to the cabin layout, because traveling through the ice makes a pretty scary sound if you're very close to the source.
Saint Petersburg cruises involve spending time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and indoors.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction, and it is not permitted to drive as if on asphalt.
During a thunderstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow or by water or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues unimpeded year-round.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's greatest tourist attraction, drawing many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to a journey overland to view Africa's incredible wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, so standard equipment will give you a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be skittish and are best viewed through binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk", "trekking safari" or "walking" trip) is a hike lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation orders vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation orders have not been extended to July 2020 - the time the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels rent an iron and an ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to get the fabric too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways of treating water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil water for a minute; in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have problems, you may want to consider purchasing water in an airtight bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they have never heard of in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway is the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, as it often passes through isolated forested backcountry.
If you are unfamiliar with country roads, be aware that they are often steep, narrow, and winding.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is extremely important to adhere to them.
Interestingly, though, cellular connectivity is much better here than on many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavarian pastries are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is quite common: apples are used in baking all year round, while cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but tasty pastry, try what is called "Berliner", "Pfannkuchen" or "Krapfen" depending on the region.
Curry is a dish consisting of herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is traditionally added to curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is traditionally added.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses the wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the nation.
But when used without further qualification, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now very common throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes, among which the predominant flavors are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's foot that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can be dangerous because of the potential for the rider's foot to get stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown and the leg is caught in the stirrup, the horse may run and pull him.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety devices that prevent the bridle from falling off the saddle if the falling rider pulls on it.
The Cochamo Valley, with its variety of granite high rises and twists, is a major rock climbing site in Chile, also known as the Yosemite of South America.
Climbing involves taking in the spectacular views from the summits, and climbers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails through the endless potential of the walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity involving many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings dating back to 5000 B.C.E. depict skiers!
Alpine skiing as a sport began no later than the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called ski backpacking, ski touring, or ski walking.
It is related to but usually does not include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being conducted on steep slopes and requiring the use of stiffer skis and shoes.
Think of a ski trip like a hiking trip.
If conditions are right, you can cover greater distances than you can on foot - but you will rarely be able to match the speed of cross-country skis without a heavy backpack on well-maintained trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a large number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean repeatedly going through visa procedures and passport control.
In this sense, however, the Schengen area acts like a single country.
By staying in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to obtain a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies characterize goods over 100 years old as antiques.
