Although an experimental vaccine appears to be successful in reducing deaths from Ebola, to date, no drug has been shown to be clearly effective for treating the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed success in the field, but formal studies have shown that it confers little benefit compared to preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the control, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but provides details that fossils cannot usually do, for example colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have suggested that this animal had a cow-pulp color under the wings and a yellow or carotenoid-colored underside to the tail.
This finding also gives insight into the cause of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur wings do not have fully formed shafts, called rachis, but have secondary wing features - barbs and barbules - researchers have speculated that rachis is the present-day leaf stage with these secondary features.
The structure of the wings provides evidence that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or permanent settlement.Studies suggested that, although it is the skull of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the upper part of an adult and not the lower part of a juvenile.
The researchers suggested that, although it was the skull of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen showed the brain of an adult and not the brain of a juvenile.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations based on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for is caused by tidal forces in the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the zone produces a ripple on the Earth, which the wave travels along, so do the Milky Way and the Kuiper Belt exert a pressure on the galaxy.
Scientists came to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around galaxies occurs in a type of halo around the galaxy, and is composed of many small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters walk into a booth and place a pre-printed ballot with the mark of their preferred candidate in an envelope.
After the voter is identified by officials, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French inheritance laws strictly bound the rules of succession.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no previously cast ballots in the box and that no envelopes have been left indicating the envelope in which the votes were counted and those of authorized voters.
Candidates may bring their own representatives to witness each part of the process; in the evening these ballots are passed around by volunteers under strict supervision.

The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, indicated to reporters that there would be no comment at least until the individual had been charged.
The document, according to the leak, refers to border disputes, which Palestine was fighting over borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, by signing the agreement, demands a military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA is prepared to withdraw such a presence after only five years.
In additional trials of mine control, the shooter was closely watched by rangers, so that the trial could be monitored and its impact assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSWA), Inc., qualified volunteers were brought into the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Parks Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were given safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martel's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission later recommended that the CEP resign before the country could take the conventional steps of holding new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the massive anti-government protests that took place in October.
Sometimes violent protests lead to an election not taking place, such as after 2011.
More than 60 incidents of iPod crashes have been found so far, resulting in a total of six fires and an average of four deaths.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 accidents involving the machine have been reported.
Last week, the METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional heat events, which the company described as "irresponsible".
The ministries responded that Apple's postponement of the report was "extremely regrettable".
The quake was felt in Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami threat.
A former Filipino policeman in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, hijacked a bus of tourists from Hong Kong and took them hostage.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued and were declared dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were soon released, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later found the body of an elderly woman as she went to the bathroom; Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and started work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligon spent her spare time doing research on preterm labor.
Her research showed that giving hormones could accelerate the maturation of a child's lungs.
Reportedly, two black boxes' flight recorders were recovered by government investigators.
Fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme", said Tommy Dreamer. ""Luna was the manager of Mangodney. Luna passed away on a dark moonlit night.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I was. Perhaps more so.
At the 2010 federal election the public counted 1,400 people who were opposed to Australia becoming a republic, an increase of 8% from 2008.
Caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term.
In the poll, 34% believed that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; although 31% thought Australia should become a republic at some point.
Olympic gold medalist Jeanine Willis had won the 100 m and 200 m freestyle in the combined at three Commonwealth Games, in the relay events, but her complaints cast doubt on her fitness.
They may take drugs to remove their scars as such drugs are banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a large known prime number on January 25.
Various people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February and the bomb was announced twice.
Comets may have been prevented from reaching Earth by bringing water with them that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists are trying to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship by signing a bill legalizing same-sex marriage the following year.
He characterized the rumors as "political talk and vulgarity".
It is speculated that he contested the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will save aircraft millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and also give pilots more accurate information.
Transport was upgraded and another overground railway stopped at Wembley, and car parking and park and ride facilities were also available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation made it likely that the game would force the team to play indoors behind closed doors for an indefinite period.
A study published last year in the journal Science reveals a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden found that this process introduced new species in only two generations and said the process took a long time, because they found Darwin's finch, Geospieza fortis, and its homeland cactus, Geospieza coniferus.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes; it can also be made into inscribed sizes.
It can also be made into wires which are then twisted or braided; these are then pressed together to form sheets.
It could be made in several layers and then glued on another layer; it could be made so thin that at one time it was decorated with colorful pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical; you can make an indicator with a little Band-Aid.
The bonding behavior changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic (alkaline) or basic.
The pH level is used to indicate the amount of hydrogen (H from pH) ions in the tested chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with one electron (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Apply the dry powder together and then rub the mixture into the hair.
Their admiration reacted to them from the outside, making them feel awkward and like a kind of shell.
Nearly all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets; these were equipped with a modern sewage system.
Remains of sewers have been found in the cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you talk to someone who lives a thousand miles away, you are using a satellite.
When a call occurs in the void, it is immediately returned to sleep.
Satellites were blasted into space by rockets; scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the view of the planet.
A 100-foot rocket would be needed to land a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed this world in incredible ways; the biggest thing the wheel did was make transportation easier and faster.
This includes trains, cars, and other transportation devices.
Most of these are medium-sized rodents that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small bears (also called tame bears) that eat small prey such as many small insects, lizards, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the notion of the square, each square having a special task to which a hundred others are competing.
Lions are the most social of bears, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of three related adult males in a row, as well as three females and children.
The Zanana are usually closely related to each other, having a large family of Bini and Koreans.
The lion pride acts like a pack of wolves or hyenas, surprising animals in a lion-like (but otherwise harmless) manner, as well as being extremely dangerous to their prey.
An accomplished athlete, he could jump (though not very well), climb, carry heavy loads and lift five times the weight of a strong human.
Lions are in the same group (genus Panthera) as jaguars, leopards, and cheetahs; all four are capable of reproduction.
The lion's roar is not his full roar, but more like a series of sensational words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals; these include rodents, snakes, lizards, and large animals; almost all animals preyed upon by ocelots are much smaller than these.
Scientists believe that axolotls chase and ambush prey with muskets, much like dogs do on land.
They can see very well in rings with the root sheath, and catch very little; ocelots will attack and leave prey attached to them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) become separated from the main population and then disperse (as if they move to a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island so they can return more easily) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different traits or adaptations than they previously needed to create a stronger competitor.
The actual populations have not changed at all, still requiring the same prior agreement.
Over time, as the new populations learned to adapt to their new environments, they were found to be very different from the rest of the population.
Eventually, after hundreds of thousands or millions of years, the two populations would look so different that they could no longer be called a race.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species; speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans exhale Plants take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., return to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide).
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis; they also provide shade.
Humans make their homes from plants and make their homes from trees and plants; most food we eat comes from plants; animals cannot survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, and it ate nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were attached to more sharp teeth than a cat, plus a hoarse set attached to the tail of a donkey, meaning it had no ears or scope to cross its path.
It is not known for sure, but it probably lived in burrows; its diet was insects, lizards, other mosasaurs, and it was probably cannibalistic.
It attacked everything that could live in the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex could not compete with it.
Although most of their food may have resembled this, the Romans had their own strange and exotic items including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor ate together and sat on comfortable chairs, the rich preferred to feast together and eat around each other.
The ancient Roman diet may not have included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to each of the gods they considered to be the father of the gods.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an inner sanctum with an open courtyard to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The tops of the towers were special sanctuaries for the gods.
Fall was not as important in the hot climate of the Middle East.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent in open fields.
The women would sleep in the courtyard; the shops were merely a few counter booths across the street; the stone was used to build the houses.
There were no major forests in Canaan, so timber was scarce.
Greenland was sparsely settled; in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled to Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west he found Greenland and named it Grønland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all the countries were 'Scandinavian', the people, kings, customs, and traditions of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland also have many differences in history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might have seen a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not the case; although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776"; the inscription was on the reverse side of the document.
Although no one knows who wrote it, it appears that in his early life, the large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was held up for presentation.
Also, it is possible that the notation was inserted here as a label.
The D-Day landings liberated the north of France with similar fighting, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French; these were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called the "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin soles, meaning soul, related to the Latin cives, meaning urban, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and thus describing the size of a society.
City-states are precursors to nations; a civilized culture means access to knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable distribution.
Microcultures often disappear without relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies had already formed a weak central government - the only one with a Congress - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to tax, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, delegated its authority to state authorities, who often did not cooperate, in enforcing all of its acts.
It also has the power to eliminate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unconditional consent of all the states as any change in them could be made by the states and the central government in cases where their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world along with the German national football team and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and the Olympics.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of Japan's cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" geographically.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century with European sailors arriving and recording the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which began to change the way local grain was produced and hired Chinese laborers to work on its rice and cotton plants.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the islands until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Doors.
Most of the buildings on the walls of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of where they originally stood.
By 1976, three percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio is inherited from the digital camera image sensor format.
This 35 mm format is rectangular, in thickness, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (simply divide by k to get the ratio of whole numbers) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The highly redundant and often paradoxical rule is a simple instruction that produces motion that scales the sequence in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the central subject is at the intersection of the line dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see illustration).
Throughout much of European history, the church remained powerful and did not interfere with scientific discovery.
Christian religions were assimilated into European states, although not as distinct as language and method.
Having so much power, Siri was able to overpower the affected king.
A key tenet of Christianity is that wealth is strictly for the poor, not for the church to use for its own sake.
The centrality of the Church was questioned for a thousand years by the preacher of Rome who saw himself as the power behind the throne.
Soon after the war broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The tactics proved effective, seizing important military and civilian supplies, although these blockades violated generally accepted international law codified by the international treaties of the past two centuries.
Britain dredged international waters to prevent any ship from entering the full extent of the ocean, even neutral ships would be at risk.
Because this tactic was limited to reprisals, Germany expected a similar response for its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the mobility attitudes of most cities and nations were pacifist and isolationist.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the future of nations also looked forward to a situation they wished to avoid.
In 1884, Tesla traveled to the United States to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York City.
She came to the U.S. with 4 cents to her name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (formerly her manager).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different times; each phase of China or each dynasty in power was a specific dynasty.
Also each dynasty had an uninterrupted era of divided provinces; the most famous of these intervals was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
This interval was marked by fierce fighting between some of the nobles fighting for the throne of Castile.
The Three Kingdoms of ancient China was one of the bloodiest periods in history, during which thousands of people died fighting to ascend to the most powerful seat in the Great Hall of the People in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the move from absolutism to democracy, nationalism and the belief that a country is not one of people but one of rulers.
After the Revolution the town was open to all male applications allowing the very ambitious to succeed.
The same is true for the military as military ranks are now based on caliber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions as well.
Muhammad was greatly interested in the affairs of this worldly life; he often used a cave known as Hira to meditate on the mountain of "Nur" (light).
Throughout his time in the cave, and surviving, Muhammad paints a highly detailed picture of a spiritual phenomenon.
Resting on a hillock in the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is isolated from the outside world.
In fact, finding it is not quite as easy as knowing it exists; inside a small cave, there is complete solitude.
The diamond can be seen only against a clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains; very little of this world can be seen or grown inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza, one of the Seven Wonders, still stands today.
Constructed in Egypt by the Egyptians over three millennia BC, the Great Pyramid was one of several large pyramid structures erected to honor the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", consists of some pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
This "up arrow" mark looks like a V and the "down arrow mark" is pointed downward like a staple or square.
Herme means you start at the bottom and press the bow, and bene means you start at the top (which is where you put the bow here) and take the bow.
An up-command typically produces a softer sound, while a down-command is harsher and more forceful.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember that the printing marks are there because of the music, so they should generally be respected.
King Louis XVI of France, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young sons (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were brought back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage and were arrested by a mob of people threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage doors.
At one place a member of the widow's crowd saw the skull of the royal guard executed at Versailles in front of the terrified King.
The Filipino people themselves bore the brunt of American imperialism's war costs in the conquest of the Philippines.
They forced the American colonial government to pay taxes to cover a large portion of the expenses and to borrow on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Without a doubt, the super-profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the Order's creation.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the High Middle Ages preceded the Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500, according to tradition.
The term technological determinism brings into the practical realm a wide range of ideas, from technological determinism or a strict sense of technological necessity that human destiny is tied to the underlying logic of scientific law, to behavior and its manifestation in technology.
Frequent interpretations of technological determinism hinge on two general assumptions: that technological progress itself follows a path that transcends cultural and political influence, and that the "impact" of technology on society follows a path that is innate and not socially conditioned.
For example, one can say that the motor car played an essential role in the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable solely for cars; new manufacturing methods have been adopted to lower car ownership costs.
The advent of mass-produced cars led to increased road accidents, which in turn led to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to prevent falls.
There is a major element of cultural determinism in Romanticism, derived from the writings of Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, people learned about geography, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and which, being compatible with the space of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was the fashion capital of the time, Constantinople was the fashion capital of European feudalism.
It became the center of luxury popularity from about 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
This location attracted centuries of Christian preachers seeking a reward for their preaching, such as the torch that lit the Byzantine market.
It was during this time that the crown of seven fashion capitals was brought to Paris from the Pont de Constantinople.
The Gothic style was at its height in the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The Pallavas were first heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style lasted 25 to 30 years in the West.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own styles; the result of the Crusades was that the greatest development of the time was the use of buttons to close a bridge.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of only the farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, mostly organic system, which maximizes yields for local ecoregions from saved seed combined with crop rotation and other simple techniques.
Historically much of this land was taken up by subsistence agriculture and still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who defy societal norms and give them a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, race, class, location, and gender of the members.
The characteristic that distinguishes a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through specific and symbolic uses of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and discussion.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to bring to the fore some of the misfortunes of children who are not socialized with adults through neglect, maltreatment, and deliberate abuse.
These children are called "feral"; some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents) and in some cases these children are prone to severe mental and physical disorders due to parental neglect.
Before feral children are born, they have experienced severe abuse and trauma.
Others are alleged to have been raised by animals; some are said to live in the forest itself.
When fully approached by non-human animals, the feral child displays behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to the apathy and fear of specially approached animals such as humans.
While project-based learning makes teaching easier and more interesting, structure goes a step further.
Coaching is not a method of learning but a support that supports individuals who are taking their learning into new experiences such as using new computer programs and starting new projects.
Props can be both native virtual and real, in other words, a master is a form of prop but so are the miniature paper clippers of Microsoft Office.
Virtual props are built into the software and are intended to ask questions, hint at, and explain concepts that the student may find difficult to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
Some children will also grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
I understand that the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is required to provide all the necessities that are lacking in their parent's home.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication with interpersonal communication.
Another functionality was added to enable the original specification of the interface.
For example, the "interesting" and "social" aspects of Internet use are discussed.
New motivational dimensions of "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" have also been identified by Egemey and McCord (1998) when investigating visitor responses to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, such as duck movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can correctly interpret a microexpression as saying what the person is saying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, points out that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess verbal sincerity.
He also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior is shared among animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century suggests that genetic variation has two essences: latent and expressed.
Variation gives rise to new genetic variations, and selection strips away the essence of this apparent variation.
Separation and recovery alter the distance between the two nuclei with each generation.
At rest, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their amino acid needs from available food resources.
Also, failure to do so has serious consequences: depression of growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources are the proteins accessible in plants and fruits, but this makes them difficult for primates to digest without being eaten.
In contrast, animal foods (beef, dairy, poultry) are not only easily digested but provide large amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that champions do today.
Sleep disruption is the act of deliberately waking up and going to sleep for a period of time (10-60 minutes) during their normal sleep period.
It may use relatively quiet alarms to bring them to consciousness without fully alerting them.
If you try to reset the house in your sleep, it may tip over, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a large amount of fluid (especially tea or coffee, a popular sedative) before bedtime, followed by drinking water to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has affects the amount of stress in the body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force; each person has the capacity for complete calmness and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment; the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of self-love.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga practices, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Central to Tibetan meditation is divine yoga; by visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and an awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US; the collision of systems, practices, and culture as the war ended left the countries in decline.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This continued for another 40 years and through proxy armies, fighting in real terms from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses were already exhausted, and Knie hoped to take and reorganize them behind Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans were presented almost overnight, as more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded Poland's eastern territories and fought on the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of seagoing vessels to transport goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods at sea today.
Navies traditionally ensure that their country maintains the ability to move men and supplies, while at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move men and supplies.
A notable recent example of this is the North Atlantic campaign of WWII; the Americans were attempting to move their men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German navy, meanwhile, was attempting to intercept the traffic using U-boats.
If the alliance had failed, Germany would almost certainly have succeeded in conquering Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Bassan cattle are thought to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early civilizations also had tribes that began keeping milk, copper, ivory, and leather for trade.
Domestic cattle kept mostly in herds that nested in the mountains or other feeding areas, were often first cared for as infants or adolescents, similar to the famous paella; this method of preparation is still used today.
Wagonways were constructed in England before the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they achieved greater speeds than trolleys and could carry heavier loads than the slightly longer coach roads.
Crutches to hold the track in place were introduced much earlier; however, gradually it was realized that putters would be made more efficient if they had archery poles on them.
This became common practice, but the chassis required small wheels on the wagons.
Caster wheels were eventually replaced by linear wheels; the first complete caster rail was introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was the horse, humans began to domesticate horses with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not have sedentary habits.
Two-toed sloths have been found with Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although two-toed sloths may have been domesticated by coelenthropes from seven million years ago.
We can live more nobly with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can reduce future suffering to some extent by becoming activists.
This is similar to a symbolic remedy; however, if we only want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and eliminate it ourselves.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems caused by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle have increased.
On July 4 and after having been authorized by Congress, the draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary of Congress Charles Thompson later burned down John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now referred to as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was burned on July 6 by George Washington, who displayed his army in New York on July 9; a copy went to London on August 10.
Twenty-five Dunlap broadsides still exist in manuscript form; none of these documents are extant.
Today paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive and call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they can grow wherever they want.
But there are also many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have hollow scales and tonsils, they are flattened, and they resemble a T-Rex on their two hind legs.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in forms of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be readily apparent; there are symptoms, such as hives that can quickly subside.
The best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of open containers of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Special first aid instructions for that particular poison should check the label.
Entomologists formally use the word bug to refer to this group of insects.
The word derives from the old recognition of bed bugs as insects designed to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are comical, designed to live in their host's alley or house.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States of America; the major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women have twice as much MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their partner, to raise a child.
These couples may decide to give their vows.
On the appointed day, the appearing mother-in-law relinquishes her rights so that another couple can become their mother-in-law.
The fundamental goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method; this method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
This is not the same as an experiment, and an experiment is a test that guides scientific inquiry by picking out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many felt that physiology and behavior depended on the presence of the endogenous cycle as well as their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms that do not involve external periodic cues have been documented for many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continuously parade free-running cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chasen inserted their DNA into a bacterium using phages or viruses.
He performed two experiments where DNA in phages was labeled with radioactive phosphorus or the proteins of phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can affect a variety of different types of mutations, depending on the type, the genetic material affected and whether the cell prominence affects germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while elsewhere the mutation causes the cell to die or become cancerous.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the scenery, including plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, driving, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the Argenteuil Volcano in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and pass by the workplaces they have left behind.
This replacement of the transport shuttle is also associated with and supported by private car transport systems.
Science now indicates that the absence of carbon dioxide disrupted the biosphere that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses other transportation systems; almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
Complaints of drinking this type of water or well are much less common than in developed countries.
Why are there so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they keep failing? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of an individual driver and vehicles as well as the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers' paths cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably well; thus, traffic flows in the right amount and can still be this calculated.
Relationships between three key characteristics are established for a better representation of traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of a roadway facility.
Camels were the first animals to fly in the air; their ability to fly protected them from predators and helped them forage and hunt.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings close to their bodies.
This gives them very little space to escape from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and damselflies are insects that cannot fold their wings.
More than a thousand years earlier, a man named Aristarchus had suggested that the solar system revolved around the ecliptic.
Some thought it was a hoax but many on the contrary believed the opposite; that the solar system itself revolved around the Earth, including the Milky Way (and other stars).
This also seems like a reasonable thought because we don't seem to have any movement of the Earth, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth; it carries eight times as much water as any other major river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, and in some places its banks meet.
A full 20 percent of the fresh water flowing into the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The original Amazon River flowed 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi); it collects the waters of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid of Giza was never surpassed in its size and technical prowess in construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the handmade buildings of their ancestors, which would have been over a thousand years old by then.
Vatican City has a population of about 800,000; it is the world's smallest independent country and one of the most sparsely populated.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the lingua franca used mostly by those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have had knowledge of the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and because they are easily discovered in nature in their natural forms as well as from simple and brown potatoes.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements; they are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also theorized that these could be converted into new substances to create the things we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals; remember there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements, such as calcium and potassium, are considered metals; metals such as gold and silver also exist.
They can also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter; all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that by the time this sentence is over there will be trillions of atoms.
Thus, the pencil was loved by many when it first came out.
Sadly, as new ways of writing such as this emerged, the pencil declined in status and use.
People now type messages on a computer screen, they no longer have to be near a sharpener.
One can only guess what the checkerboard will look like when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that a single nucleus contains the binding energy of many protons and neutrons.
For example, a hollow sphere suspended over a mountain; redistributing the mass of the nucleus releases energy into it.
Some atoms have unstable nucleosynthesis which means they break apart with little or no agitation.
Kidney stones are made up of kidney and spleen; the innermost layer of the kidney is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick near the poles and 100 km thick at the poles.
It is as thin as marble and as thick as slate.
Nearby there were more maria because the crust was thinner; lava flowed to the surface.
Materialist theories focus on finding things that people like or dislike.
These theories propose that people have certain needs and/or desires that remain internalized as adults.
These theories look at what it is about some people that compels peace to desire the things they do and what it is about their environment that compels peace to do or not to do something.
Two popular theories of materiality are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Heisenberg's two factor theory.
In general, two attitudes can emerge when managers begin to lead their subordinates; at one end of the spectrum is the "one of the guys" (or girl) trying to lead.
This type of manager has difficulties making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, reviewing performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an anonymous individual who feels that the change he or she must make is being done by some team in order to make it their own.
Ultimately, leadership is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Sometimes this behavior results in a fight between the rules and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of competence as traditional teams, but with small differences.
Virtual team members often work at the point of contact with their immediate physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones which are not understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larsen and LaVasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
This "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports; this growing team determines the quality of each member.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is to no longer.
Creativity can also arise easily when all available resources are used effectively in the working department of an enterprise.
In turn, processes within an organization that work together to overcome a constraint can lead to a new process to meet the customer's need.
Before any organization can innovate itself, leadership needs to establish a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational know-how.
Angel (2006), defines the continuum approach as seeing it as a method used by organizations to reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating cognition; therefore narrowing the area of research and making it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and addiction also provides scientists with a window into their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, trauma, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides the information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the mind.
Although AI is a strong concept of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with machine learning and intelligent adaptations.
Research in AI is building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to answer customer evaluation questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and skill.
Such things have become distinct fields, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military as built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are always a big part of the classroom; often a teacher prefers to take his or her students to a place where there simply is no opportunity for travel.
Technology offers the solution of virtual field visits; students can go outside with their class to see museum specimens, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the period and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website based on their visit to the state capitol, each year a new website is created, but the old ones are kept online as scrapbooks.
Blogging helps students improve their writing; although students often start their blogs with incorrect grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
While students of knowledge write more abstractly, bloggers try to improve their writing.
Blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them"; audiences say that people's interest encourages children to be smarter and more curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, encouraging students to share knowledge they have learned both inside and outside of traditional school days.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet content, students can explain their own position in the context of others' writing and their perspective on specific issues" (O'Rourke, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bustling capital of Canada and has an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the far south is Niagara Falls and to the north is the scenic beauty of Muskoka.
All of these things and more make Ontario unique enough to be considered Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, large areas are very sparsely populated and some nearly uninhabited.
For a population comparison that will surprise many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadians.
The East African archipelago is in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, yet is itself a continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands belong to independent nations, or to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam is also widespread on the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the coast and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that any female traveler should be married, regardless of their marital status.
Logical arguments are also useful (not just the one that makes the most sense).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in harassment and stalking, unwanted advances, etc.
Men are reluctant to accept rejection, afraid to stand up for themselves (cultural differences or not, don't fix that!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in 10 BCE, and used as a strategic port called Infa by Phoenicians, Romans and Merinds.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as the capital Al-Bayda, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting locations for shopping in all of Morocco.
There are hundreds of places to buy traditional Moroccan goods around the old medina, such as tagines, matzah, leather goods, hakha, and gigawatts across a spectrum, but these are all for tourists.
Goma, in the far east near Rwanda, is a political city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried many of the city's streets, especially the downtown.
To the extent that Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be done researching why there is constant fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is a base for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa, including trekking up the Nyiragongo Volcano.
To get to and from Goma you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi); the typical local price is a small round trip of ~500 Congolese francs.
Given its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and there is an airport.
In 1990, the Sahara Desert was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger.
It was an important stop during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African temperament.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
At all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be advantageous for someone to receive a wildcard, which grants admission to a selection of South African parks or to one of all South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is what many tourists regard as the main attraction.
The parade of buildings making up Hong Kong's skyline is illustrated with a glowing bar chart illustrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, cross the island to the Kowloon Waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is clustered on its land reclaimed by the bay along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists saw themselves and according to Amy is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) along the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian highlands.
The Sunderbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site; the eight sections of forest within the Indian territory are known as the Sunderbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sunderbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third comprises wetlands.
The Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted hyenas in the area.
Buses depart throughout Doha from the Inter-District Bus Station (Daribas Apara), although most, especially those heading east to Cachan depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge; it spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long and its two lanes are 3.50 metres wide.
The footbridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plant will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was surrounded by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuri and Payagu, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, previously called "a large province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely succeeded in retaining its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina has one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
Many of the biggest tournaments take place in December in the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also be held here at other times of the year.
For news of the tournament as well as the ticket counters for polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located at the FIC West store on Stanley.
British pounds are commonly accepted throughout the island and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with street owners to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money outside the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summers when the Northern Hemisphere has winters and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are common in the tropics.
Winters can be deceptively cold: the temperature sometimes drops slightly, but the air and humidity combined feel much colder than a thermometer would indicate.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards/metre away from elephants and rhinos and 25 yards/metre away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they seem, baboons, elk, moose, hops, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance; these animals are large, fierce and very dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that musk deer and other wildlife are attracted to musk, so avoid carrying or eating musk deer and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa; the town is on Upolu island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889 when ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to dock.
All ships sunk, except one British cruiser; only about 200 American and German ones survived.
During the independence struggle organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the paramount chief Topova Tamassee Lyaloufi III.
Straddling Auckland's two harbours are a number of beaches; the most popular are in the three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Harbor District) extends from the Pacific Ocean north of Lough Neagh to Genoa.
These roughly seri-sectioned beaches are similar to Wainwright Beach and Pohouka Cove.
Tamaki Drive Beach is on Waitemata Harbour overlooking Mission Bay and St Helier to Auckland.
There are places where families can go to shop without fear of being robbed; as such, wine is not a risk.
'Number One' of the main local beers, it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing; other local beers are called "manta".
There are many French wines, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia tend to be the best.
Local tap water is perfectly safe for drinking, but bottled water is easier to swallow if you're scared.
The idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians; a small roast is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is thickened with cream (not cream), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards; fruit juice is cheap but excellent.
There are many visits to the reef throughout the year, and there are very few injuries from any of these causes on the reef.
However, consult authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been found near ponds and streams from October to April in the north since the 1770s; they are occasionally found outside of that time.
Sharks do exist, however they do occasionally attack humans; most sharks hunt humans and look away.
Freshwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being the North River in Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have somewhere to stay when they return to their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although other places to stay, such as campgrounds, can also be booked through travel agents.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, arranging transportation to/from the airport, or combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold reservations for you if you need time to think about the offer or to prepare other documentation (e.g. visa) for your visit.
Any modifications or requests must be accepted by the travel agent and not the hotel directly.
For some festivals, music festival attendees often decide to camp at the site, and most attendees find this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, hurry to get to a campsite near the beach and music.
Note that although the music has died down on the main stages, there are sections of the fair that play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic in the wind, check the cabin location, as passing over the chest would cause quite a frightening noise for most victims.
A tour of St. Petersburg includes time in the city; cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by patrons; doors and houses are usually absent, and getting out becomes difficult.
They usually consist of offerings of food, drink, and entertainment, to keep the inhabitants in a good mood, and to keep them grounded.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house; however, inebriation affects the decision, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving a car at cooler latitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of sleet, sleet, or freezing temperatures.
On a one-lane road, friction is less and you cannot drive the same way as you can on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow may fall in a very short period of time to trap soot.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or ice on the windshields of vehicles.
On the other hand, snowy and icy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted year after year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and are a special treat for many visitors.
The term safari refers to an overland journey, especially to the savannah, to view famous African wildlife.
Some animals, such as swans and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard instruments give good views.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and therefore see better with binoculars.
Bush safaris (also known as "bush walks", "hiking safaris", or "footing") consist of hiking trips, either lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will run from 24 August to 5 September 2021; some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you had booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could still face difficulties.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellations in late March did not occur until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets for most events can cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Wet pillows holding a purse can help dry them; many hotels have a purse and a purse board available for loan, regardless of whether it is in the same room.
If no purse is available, or if you prefer not to wear socks with your purse, you can try using an available hairdryer.
Be careful not to overheat clothing (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas submersion for one minute is sufficient, others require several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and you should also consider buying a sealed bottle from a reputable company if you have any concerns.
Travelers encountered places they were unfamiliar with in their homelands.
Germs can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by sheer force, do not usually qualify as worms.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise in certain locations.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save significant amounts on products such as specialty alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your opinions to yourself: steep grades, narrow streets, and speeding.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - than those of the northern and eastern sections - and their strict adherence is higher than that in other cases.
Interestingly, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very similar, and as rich and varied in Bavaria as in their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastry is typical with ripe cherries throughout the year, and during the summer there are glasses and bowls for displaying cherries.
Many German confections also include nuts, seeds, and other herbs; popular cakes in particular are often topped with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry try eating Berliner, Pfenkkuchen or Krupfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of water, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, colostrum is commonly used in rice; in South India and some other Sahel regions of the subcontinent, cow's milk is commonly used.
Choosing from among 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifiers, the term actually means the cuisine of the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the island, Javanese cuisine encompasses an array of merely abandoned foods, Javanese flavors mostly include peanuts, marijuana, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stripes are supports for the rider's arms that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but are likely to have safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider falls off a horse but is caught in an obstacle, they can still be picked up if they wish. To reduce these risks, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, fairly narrow, cross.
Later, some zines, especially English ones, had a protective shield that the leather zine gave off if the rider of a pinwheel stepped on it.
Coquimbo Valley - Chile's largest eroded place, called the Yosemite of South America, with large walls and canyon walls of different types of granite.
Bald eagles include many pleasing bald eagle-eye views; mountains from all parts of the world form continuous paths through the endless possibilities.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are downhill sports practiced by people who ski or snowboard down steep slopes.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski boomers", planning entire vacations to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by the Norwegian Volvo in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but generally does not include alpine style ski touring or ballroom, the latter taking place in steeper terrain and requiring stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as the same as a hiking route.
In good conditions you can cover some distances on foot - but very rarely do you get the speed of cross-country skiing in the trails without a backpack.
Europe is a continent that is small but has many independent countries; under normal circumstances, traveling to more than one country means going through visa applications and passport control many times.
However, the Schengen zone acts like a country in this respect.
Even if you live in this zone you can usually cross another border without a passport control checkpoint.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax agencies refer to items more than 100 years old as antiques.
There are geographic variations in definitions, with lower age limits in places like North America compared to Europe.
The objects of this craft can be compared to antiques, though they are smaller than manufactured goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income and trade among the Sami and the culture surrounding it is also important to many other professions.
Even though traditionally not all Sami engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, they led lives of cattle herding, hunting, and so on, with reindeer being the most common draft animal.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades; tourism is an important source of income in Sami areas.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romanies, the word "nomad" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions of Romani people.
If you visit a country that has been issued a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their residents.
As an example, Americans living in the Middle East would encounter different conditions from Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories contain only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The ideas presented are often superficial, general, and more easily understood than the more detailed information available.
Severe weather is a broad term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and has different types, depending on geography, topography, and environmental conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, waterspouts, and storms.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, ice storms, hailstorms, and tornadoes.
Travelers are strongly advised to stay aware of extreme weather hazards affecting their area as they may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone must receive professional training.
An approximate local company address can be found by searching for 'opposite environment course' on the Internet.

Rip currents are the return currents of waves breaking over the seabed, often on or near rocks.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated at some ends, and strong currents can form at the ends.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue attempting to swim back upstream against the current, which is not possible.
As you swim out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
