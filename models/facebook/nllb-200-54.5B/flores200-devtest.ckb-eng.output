This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has gained wide acceptance, but provides details that fossils do not, such as color and three-dimensional organization.
The feathers on the upper side of this animal were a dull brown and the underside was yellow or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed crest, called a rachis, but have other feather features (barbs and barbules), researchers have found that rachis evolved similarly to other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than juvenile plumage.

In France, voting has been a non-technological experience: voters go to the ballot box and take a printed piece of paper with a symbol of the candidate they want and place their vote in a letter envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the letter in the ballot box and signs the voter's register.

The shooters of the Total Control Affair trial were captured and had to be closely monitored by guards, as the trial was monitored and its impact assessed.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers are recruited for the NSW Shooting Program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Wildlife Conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first act of shooting were given intensive instruction and safety training.
Duane Martelly was sworn in by the nine-member Provincial Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission was proposed before the resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The somewhat violent protest was due to the lack of elections, which were supposed to be held in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating were reported, and six of them caught fire causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was aware of 27 incidents involving machinery.
Last week METI reported that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company said were "not serious".
The department responded by calling the delay of Apple's report "an utterly deplorable act".
At 07:19 local time, (09:19 GMT) the earthquake struck off the Mariana Islands.
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency, there were no casualties nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said no tsunami signals had been recorded.
A former Philippine police officer takes Hong Kong tourists hostage after their bus overturns in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several bodies have been recovered and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed water. Mendoza was killed.
Le Guin followed in her father's footsteps and became a physician.
She trained as an obstetrician and began work at Auckland Women's National Hospital in 1959.
While working at Linggins Hospital, she began researching preterm birth during her spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone is administered, it can accelerate lung maturation in the fetus.
Zenoah reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of the flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow professional wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was my first drag queen. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Goldfinger" Runnels said that "Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe more...I love her and miss her...I hope she's better now".
Of the 1,400 people who voted prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said at the end of the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
He was the Olympic gold medallist for freestyle swimming in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question by his complaints.
He was unable to receive the necessary medication to relieve his pain because they were banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of Earth's water supply as well as the organic matter necessary to make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have historically collided with the Earth.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Satellite-based technology displays differently from radar-based technology so that air traffic controllers can identify aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is scheduled and no trains stop at Wembley, no car parking or ground access facilities are available.
Fears of a lack of transportation led to the possibility of the match being forced to be played indoors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the discovery of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have noted that new species have evolved in only two generations, although this process is expected to take much longer, due to crossbreeding between the Darwin's cactus moth, Geospiza, and the migratory cactus moth, Geospiza coniferostris.
Gold can be shaped into any desired shape.
It can be stretched into a thin wire and then rolled into a flag.
It can be very thin and written with other metals. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate illustrated books called "decorative prints".
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red algae juice.
Celery juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, crush them into granules.
The fluid in your hand interacts with the outer layers, causing a feeling of discomfort and a kind of blistering.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in Minoan houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, aqueducts were sometimes part of public bathing cells where men and women bathed together.
When you communicate with someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The in-orbit satellite receives the communication and then transmits it down, at approximately the same time.
The satellite was launched by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light we see.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a telescopic satellite into space.
Tai Chi has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing Tai Chi has done for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
It enabled us to build trains and cars and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are some small cats (including domestic feral cats) that eat a much higher proportion of insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and are averse to large groups.
The pride is made up of one to three adult males, with thirty females and juveniles.
In general the females are closely related, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions behave like packs of dogs and wolves, which are similar to lions (but not other members of the cat family) in being extremely aggressive towards their prey.
The tiger is an accomplished athlete who can climb (though not often), swim, and leap, and has five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
Pling is not a full lion vowel, but more like a shouted word phrase.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals. Monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds are its prey. Most of the animals it hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that the ocelot uses scent to locate animals and locate food (nature), by smelling where they are on the ground.
They can see better in the dark with night vision, and move very quickly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small group of organisms (a subpopulation) becomes separated from the main population from which it came (such as if it falls off a mountain or crosses a river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return) it often finds itself in an environment different from its previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to the previous situation.
The indigenous population has not undergone any changes, still requiring the same adaptation as before.
Over time as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they gradually become less similar to the rest of the population.
Gradually over thousands or even millions of years the two populations become too different to be considered the same element.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, absorbing the carbon dioxide that humans give off (i.e. exhale).
Plants use photosynthesis to make their own food from sunlight. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the tallest predator of its time, fearing none but other mosasaurs.
The long claws have 70 sharp, simple incisors, with an extra row of teeth in the malleolus, meaning nothing is missing from the swallowing jaws.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet was turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been carnivorous.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, even giant dinosaurs such as T-Rex.
While much of their food is familiar to us, the Romans certainly had strange and unusual items, such as wild boar, peacocks, lollipops and a species of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the woman ate sitting at the table, while the rich men liked to eat decorated zeros together and recline at their tables.
Ancient Roman meals did not include the foods that came to Europe from the Americas and Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard with inner chambers that only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The first was called the Most Holy Place,
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not very important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was spent abroad.
Women practiced cooking in the square; shops had just opened their doors overlooking the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there was not much wood, so wood was very expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for bloodshed. When he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Grønland.
But regardless of this discovery, Eskimo tribes themselves lived in the area at the time.
Although each of the countries was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples such as the kings themselves, traditions, history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you've probably had the impression that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, with an appendix.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large manuscript evidence (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) that it was meant to hold was looted.
Therefore, it seems likely that the inscription was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent wars liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the occupiers rather than fight against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as "Operation British Knight".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, hence a society.
The word civic comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, town or city of the country, and this in turn defines the size of the community.
City-states existed before nations. Urban culture meant the transmission of knowledge back and forth for generations, spreading the cultural legacy of the judges.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially created a weak central government - with Congress as the sole structure - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the authority to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or legislature, relying on state authorities that were often uncooperative in enforcing all laws.
It also had no power to waive interstate taxation and customs laws.
Statutes required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states had so little regard for the federal government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, hockey, skiing, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most common in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to its large number of islands, Japan is often referred to as the "Archipel", due to its geographical location.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by an island called Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the practice of producing wheat in the traditional way, employing Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and Taiwan became a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki relinquishing sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of six major statues, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings are built on the edges of residential communities to give visitors an idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and renovations continue to this day.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the film camera era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proportions are determined by the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format, slightly misleading, is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Most common formats (the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating activity while maintaining order in an image.
It is said that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds on the vertical and horizontal planes (see example).
During this period in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under intense scrutiny.
For a thousand years, Christianity has bound European countries together despite differences in language and culture.
Its power affected everyone from the wealthy to the ordinary individual.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should only be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and contributions to the church are intended for that purpose only.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money raised many questions as to whether or not this belief had been realized.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated international law adopted by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
The British also mined international waters to prevent poppies from entering any part of the ocean, posing a threat to even neutral poppies.
Having had a limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing and experiencing the horrors of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Nikola Tesla went to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of representing different times, each Chinese period or dynasty being a different dynasty.
Within each dynasty, there was also a period of instability in the division of provinces. The most famous of these was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this time there were violent wars between several kings fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died fighting for the seat of power in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
There are many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift in attitudes towards republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single president.
Also after the revolution, professions were opened to men and those with aspirations were mostly successful.
The same is true in the military, because instead of rank being based on rank, it's now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply concerned with the things beyond this ordinary life. He regularly retreated to a cave called "Hara" on Mount "Nur" (Light) for meditation and reflection.
The cave itself, untouched by the passage of time, shows a clear picture of Muhammad's religious side.
Resting on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find, even if someone knows it's there.
Nothing is visible except the beautiful clear sky and the surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of several large pyramids built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large obelisk.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and other temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up arrow" symbol resembles the letter V and the "half arrow down" symbol resembles an upside-down arrow or a bottomless square.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the lever, and down means you should start at the frog's side (where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
Raising the fretboard produces a softer sound, lowering it produces a louder sound.
Feel free to take notes but remember that violin printed symbols are prepared for musical reasons, so they should be respected and not tampered with.
King Louis XVI of France, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by some market ladies.
They returned to Paris by carriage and were surrounded by a crowd who shouted and jeered and threatened the King and Queen.
The mob forced many queens and kings to open their carriage windows completely.
From time to time a member of the society decapitated a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles in front of the Empress Dowager.
The costs of US imperialism's war of conquest in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to pay for a major portion of the expenses and benefits documented on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people provide the basic income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The age in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological determinism or technological pragmatism to a narrower sense in which human destiny is subject to the logic associated with scientific laws and explanations in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of the theory of technological singularity share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself is on a trajectory behind the influence of culture and politics, and that technology itself has "effects" on societies from the very beginning, as socially constructed.
For example, one might argue that motorized vehicles lead to improved roads.
But the national road network is not economically viable for large numbers of cars, so new production methods have been invented to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Multiple car ownership leads to more traffic accidents and this leads to the development of new health care techniques to repair the damage done to the body.
Romanticism has had a significant component in defining culture, drawing from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romanticist concept, geography is the study of the interaction of individuals, over time, with the traditions and cultures associated with that geography, which have evolved in accordance with society's place in the imposed hierarchy.
Just as Paris had been dubbed the fashion capital of the New World, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of post-revolutionary Europe.
It rose to prominence as a prosperous center in 400 CE and continued until 1100 CE.
Its status declined during the 12th century as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silks and spices far more valuable than the Byzantine market could buy.
It was at this time that the title of capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Initially clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the West.
But due to the lack of communication channels, the Western forms were delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europeans began to develop their own styles. One of the major developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttoned-up clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture practised for the production of enough food to meet the needs of only the farmer and his family.
Organic agriculture is simple, often organic, and systematic in which locally stored seeds are combined with crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture and this continues today in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
A subculture may be defined by the age, origin, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographic, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a culture group often signal their membership through the use of symbols and distinctive styles of dress, behavior, and vocabulary.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to show the sad cases of children who were not integrated into society due to neglect and unwanted situations and mistreatment by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or feral. Feral children have been confined by people (generally by their parents); in some cases this confinement has been due to the parent's rejection of the child's severe mental or physical problems.
Feral children are more likely to be abused or traumatized before being abandoned or abandoned.
Others are suspected to have been raised by animals or to have lived in the wild.
When introduced to non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (during the physical confinement period) nearly identical to those of typical animals, such as fear or dislike of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather a collaboration that provides support to individuals undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the little man with the Microsoft Office paper shredder.
Virtual stairs are built into the software and are intended to question, challenge, and explain procedures that students might otherwise have to work through on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, educated and cared for, but this is the situation.
We make the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our alternative family system is set up to provide a safe home and caregivers with a soft heart, a stable education and reliable health care.
A substitute family is appointed who must provide for the needs that were not met in the previous home.
The Internet combines elements of public and private communication.
The distinctive nature of the Internet has led to more dimensions in the areas of consumption methods and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "social integration" are suggested to be important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuity of relationships" were also identified as aspects of new motivation by Egme and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of small phrases, facial movements that take a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it states that individuals can tell whether the other person is lying or not by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, showed how people who could not understand the speech due to brain damage were able to evaluate it accurately and honestly.
He even suggested that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be similar to those of animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and truncated.
Mutations add new genetic diversity, and selection removes it from the pool of existing diversity.
The separation and blending of differences between the two populations with each generation.
In the savanna it is very difficult for an ape-like animal with a digestive system similar to humans to obtain its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Also, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant sources of protein are leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are chewed.
In contrast, animal foods (caterpillars, lizards, eggs) are not easily digested, but provide high levels of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savannah monkeys do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of intentionally awakening during your normal sleep period and then falling asleep within a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using an alarm clock to wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find that you're manipulating the clock in your sleep, it's best to put it somewhere else in your bedroom so that you don't have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on circadian rhythms require drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which are diuretics) before bedtime, to make the person more likely to feel the urge to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is related to the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive life force there is. Everyone has the potential to find peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is one's own bias and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the Mahayana path of love and incorporates much of Indian yoga.
Conceptually, Tibetan Buddhism is very sacred. It includes Kundalini yoga and meditation and the path of holistic love.
In Kundalini yoga the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Central to Tibetan thought is the yoga of the divine. By visualizing the various deities, channels of energy are purified, gratitude is activated, and a sense of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, resulting in an alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Once the war was over, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures caused the countries to become isolated.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It lasted for the next 40 years and was actually fought by mercenary armies on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive line collapsed and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were disrupted overnight, when 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops moved in and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern part of Polish territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and several other national agreements at the bilateral and multilateral levels.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The function of navies has traditionally been to protect your country's ability to move people and goods, while disrupting your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One notable example was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the time, the German navy was using U-boats to try to stop the Holocaust.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany would most likely have been able to invade Britain as it was the only country left to invade.
The goat appears to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to their milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were maintained in herds that roamed on hills and other green areas, often led by children and grandchildren, gathering in a manner similar to herding. This method of gathering is still used today.
Wagonways were developed in the early 16th century in England.
Although the chariot tracks were only parallel planks, it allowed horses to be faster and to pull heavier loads than on the rough roads of the time.
Railroad ties were invented very early to connect the track together. It gradually became apparent that the tracks worked better if they had a piece of iron on them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels.
Eventually the plank wheel was replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767 the first railway was announced.
The first transition was walking, two million years ago when humans began to walk on two legs with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
Bipeds have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living a much more environmentally friendly life, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future problems to some extent.
This is in most cases symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't want a temporary solution on its own, then we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to eliminate them.
Clearly, the world has changed as a result of human and scientific progress, and the problems have grown larger because of population growth and humanity's increasing lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a draft manuscript was sent by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, and they are now known as the "Dunlap proclamations".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the steps of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who requested that it be read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy of the document arrived in London on 10 August.
The most extensive 25 Dunlap copies in existence are the earliest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive: birds.
Many people don't believe they are dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that make them similar to dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs similar to T. rex.
Virtually all computers today are based on the use of information encoded in the binary numeral system.
A binary number has only one value, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Nasal toxicity may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms such as rash are generalized and are not immediately diagnosed.
The best indication of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Check the label of the first-aid kit for instructions on the specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a more formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The concept comes from the ancient familiarity of bed bugs, which are mosquitoes well adapted to prey on humans.
Both larvae and pupae emerge as immature adults and develop in the host.
In the United States, there are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the number one allergic disease in young adults aged 40 years and older.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely as males to experience complicated seizures.
A couple can decide whether it is in their best interest or the child's best interest to have a child.
The couple may also plan to adopt a child.
In the case of adoption, the original parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
Although not an experiment per se, an experiment is an evaluation used to disprove one or more hypotheses, and its questioning and observations guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists or philosophers have emphasized the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek science declined, the West distanced itself from Greek philosophy and its scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are highly dependent on the presence of circadian rhythms and their generation by cellular biological clocks.
Internal rhythms that are not responses to external stimuli exist in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Self-regulating biological clocks operate for a certain period of time in the red even without a power source.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the pioneering proposals that DNA is the genetic material.
Attack and chase used microbes or viruses to insert their DNA units into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments each in which they labeled the DNA in the nucleus with radioactive phosphorus or the nucleus protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation and the importance of the gene fragment affected and whether the affected cells are mixed germline cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations cause either cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the scenery and the flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting gardens, and exploring ecosystems.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning people leave their small towns to drive to work and meet those who have finished work.
In this transportation hub, everyone is connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this large carbon economy removed the biosphere from one of the stable conditions that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Everyone has complaints about transportation systems.
In developing countries you rarely hear the same amount of scale on their water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such problems, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent?
Traffic dynamics is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic dynamics is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave well at reasonable distances, so traffic lanes have a regular shape and can be roughly analyzed using mathematics.
To better visualize traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and implementation of regulatory tools.
Insects were the first organisms to acquire wings. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings over their bodies.
This gives them greater scope for small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and monkeys.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was correct but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the world's river water flowing into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids remained the first in terms of size, technical excellence and construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which at the time were over 1,000 years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world and the least densely populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian as the language of legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the language spoken daily by most of those working in the country, and Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the presence of base metals such as gold, silver, and copper in ancient artifacts, all of which exist in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that all matter is composed of a combination of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air and fire.
This looked more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they could change into new matter to create what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have a mixture of materials that contain small amounts of non-metallic compounds such as carbon.
Everything in this universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the space at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, as new forms of writing emerged, the pencil became less important and less used.
People now type messages on a computer screen and don't need a stylus.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will look like when something new is installed.
A fission bomb works on the principle that a unit of energy is required to fuse together a nucleus containing many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a cart up a hill, smashing the nuclei again and releasing that energy.
Some molecules are unstable, meaning they separate with few or no bonds.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker below the hyena.
There may have been more magma on the near side because the crust was thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on discovering what makes people tick or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are inherent in maturity and growth.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to want certain things in their environment that causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two common content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can arise when managers begin to outperform their former peers. One is to remain a team member.
This type of manager has difficulty making rational decisions, performing coordinated actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and criticizing people.
Over time, individuals feel they have to change everything the team does and make it their own.
The leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often this behavior causes friction between leaders and the team as a whole.
Virtual teams are generally held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the immediate physical team.
They often have more freedom than simulation team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larsen and LaFastow, 1989, p. 109) is also a notable component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the executive body in which each member contributes to the members' report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional areas of an organization, creativity and ingenuity emerge.
Consequently, an organization's processes working together to overcome a barrier can lead to the creation of new processes to meet user needs.
Before an organization can innovate, its leadership must create a culture of innovation and participation in organizational knowledge and learning.
Engel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Organic sensing data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of the situation. So this narrows the field of study and makes it more realistic.
The link between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of trauma affect behavior and alter certain brain functions.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to see structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build experimental models that help us understand our mental processes.
Although Al has a strong interest in artificial intelligence, Al created an important branch of computer science to deal with behavioral adaptation and machine learning and intelligence.
Research in artificial intelligence (AI) involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling, and the ability to respond analytically to user questions and recognize handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
These types of things have evolved into different foundations, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often teachers like to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology offers solutions through virtual tours. Students can look at objects in museums, visit aquarium exhibits, or admire fine art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the nation's capital. The website is updated every year, but older versions remain online for use as a reference.
Blogs also aid student writing. While students often begin their blogging experience and their writing is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, having an audience generally improves these aspects.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins his efforts to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes many readers more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to satisfy the audience motivates students to be smart and observant (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to encourage collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning and transcend traditional boundaries.
Appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become analytical and critical thinkers. By actively responding to the Internet, students can know their own position within the range of others' writings and their own perspective on certain issues" (Oravek, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is Canada's vibrant bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the scenic Muskogee River.
All of these things make Ontario what people outside of Canada refer to as Canadian.
A large area to the north is extensively irrigated and some areas are un-irrigated and wild.
For a population comparison that will surprise many: in the United States there are far more African-American citizens than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar has the world's largest wildlife and is itself a continent of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or allies of France, and are known for their prosperous coastal climate.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, adopting a major form in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered on the north by the Pacific Ocean and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Almost all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is a good idea to wear a ring on one's finger (otherwise one will look too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences may cause them to perceive abuse and that it is not uncommon to be chased, handcuffed, etc.
Be assertive in rejecting men, don't be afraid to be assertive (culturally different or not, that's not a good thing!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Myrmidons as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bayda and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the most popular tourist destinations in all of Morocco.
Near the old medina you can easily find several shops selling Moroccan goods such as crowns, turbans, leather, cocks and many other useless items, but all for tourists.
Goma is a resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was devastated by the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is safe, any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the war situation that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla sanctuaries in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
"Timbuktu", which you can hardly reach, has become a word to describe a fascinating and remote land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its popularity makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the main stations during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special The Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flavour than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is South Africa's largest national park (Sun Park).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily entrance fee.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides admission to a selection of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the mainland and is a popular tourist destination.
The representation of the buildings that make up Hong Kong International Airport is illustrated by a bright line drawn through the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban growth has been concentrated on land along the northern shores.
This is where the British colonists took up residence and so if you are looking for evidence of a region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest fragmented mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean from the coast.
The Sunderbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is part of the Indian subcontinent's Sunderbans National Park.
The forests are only mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the dense forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
Since the Sunderbans became a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses leave the districts and cross the river during the day and run mainly eastbound, leaving Jakarta/Bumtang at 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses within the districts are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most prefectures have Japanese coastal buses that provide reliable and comfortable transportation.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (No. 150) and Pune (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Loyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two runways 3.50 meters wide.
The span under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011; it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be completed in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group to settle in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced agriculture.
The Chaco region was the original home of other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Territory of the Indies", was formed as a result of the conflict with the Spanish colonizers by the indigenous people of the place.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a distinct indigenous identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can be viewed here at other times of the year.
For travel information and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound.
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are widely accepted on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted.
Credit cards are not accepted on the outer islands, although British and American currency is accepted, but ask the owners in advance what their preferred method of payment is.
It is unlikely that Falkland currency will be exchanged outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months temperatures can rise above 30 °C (86 °F), which is normal.
Winters can be very cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains approximately constant throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to human presence, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife.
Although they may seem tame, elk, deer, wild boar, bear, and almost any large animal can be aggressive.
Several visitors are injured each year because they do not keep their distance. These animals are large and aggressive, and potentially dangerous, so keep your distance.
In addition, be aware that the smell may attract bears and other wildlife, so keep smelly food out of your tent and the area clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of 40,000.
Apia was built in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port became infamous in 1889 when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbour.
All the ships were sunk, except for the British, and about 200 American and German ships were lost.
In an attempted coup d'état for independence organized by the Maoist movement, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of President Tupua Tamasese Liaofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's two harbours. The most common are in three distinct areas.
The Port Shore Coastline (located in North Haven County) is on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a number of shops along the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'number one', not a complex beer, but fun. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French drinks to be had, but New Zealand and Australian drinks may fare better.
Domestic tap water is generally safe to drink, but bottled water is easier if you're afraid.
To Australians, the idea of a 'white coffee with milk' is foreign. Espresso, a cappuccino with a creamy head, is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the seamounts are made throughout the year and injuries due to these seamounts are very rare.
Still, seek advice from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish congregate near coasts and rivers from October to April in the northern 1770s. They occasionally spawn outside of these times.
Sharks exist, of course, and although they rarely attack humans, most sharks fear and avoid humans.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is at the headwaters of rivers north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance reassures travellers that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel companies often have special deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the travel company.
Generally, tour companies offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even a package of airfare and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your application (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, large numbers of music festival attendees choose to pitch tents at the venue and the majority of attendees consider this to be an important work experience.
If you want to be closer to the action, you should arrive early to find a tent near your music venue.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the main stage has ended, there may be parts of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location as the passage through the ice creates a lot of noise for noise-sensitive people.
Ferries to Saint Petersburg also include time in the city. Passengers on ferries are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally make great efforts to keep patrons from spending too much time and money. There are no windows or clocks, and exit doors are difficult to find.
Generally the offerings of food, drink and entertainment are private, to keep the guests in good spirits, and to keep them in place.
Some establishments offer alcoholic drinks on the house. However, drunkenness is frowned upon and every good gambler knows the importance of not getting drunk.
Anyone driving at high altitudes above sea level or on mountains should be aware of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is very low and you cannot drive as well as on gravel.
During a blizzard, so much snow falls in a short period of time that you can get stuck.
The level of visibility may be limited by falling or exposure to snow or by condensation or frost on a car window.
While ice and snow conditions are normal in most countries, traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Raw travel is the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In general, the term safari refers to overland travel to see African wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, appear to be close to standard vehicles and equipment, allowing them good vision.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs and leopards are shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A safari on foot (also called a "grass walk", "hike" or "walk") involves climbing mountains that take either several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you are likely to fall into a strange and unpredictable situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020 when the Olympic Games were postponed.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost around ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing ¥7,000.
Drying wet clothes helps keep them dry. Most hotels have drying tables and stoves even if they are not in the hotel room.
If a hairdryer is not available, or you prefer not to use an open hairdryer, you can use a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to leave the cloth too hot (it may crack or burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, water flows in just one minute, in other places it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if in doubt, drink bottled water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pets that are unfamiliar in their regions.
Harmful organisms spoil food, irritate the body, cause allergies, release toxins, and transmit disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from duties and taxes in certain locations.
Travelers bound for heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a good amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The intersection between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which passes through isolated backwoods areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of the steepness and narrowness of the road.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in earlier and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and full compliance with them is even more important than other possibilities.
Strangely, cell phone service is much stronger here than in other parts of the trail, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German brewing is very old, and Bavaria has a rich variety, similar to its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Hourier's work with fruit is common; apples are baked in a cake, and cherries and plums appear in summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other berry spices. Popular cakes often taste great with a cup of bitter coffee.
If you fancy some light fare, eat what is known locally as Berliner, Funkochen or Krapfen.
It is a process of cooking herbs and spices together with meat or vegetables.
It is either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry-type dishes, while in South India and some coastal regions, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a holistic concept that encompasses a diverse array of regional foods native to the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the word refers to food originating from central and western Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese food varies from simple spicy dishes to popular Javanese favourites such as ali baba and tuna pepper and sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) with various spices.
A stirrup is a support for a rider's legs that sits on either side of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the rider but can have safety concerns due to the hidden side of the rider's foot that gets caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but his leg is caught in the saddle and the horse rears up, he will fall. To reduce this risk, several preparations must be made.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have pads and a loose, narrow sole.
Finally, some saddles, notably English saddles, have safety glass that prevents leather from falling out of the saddle if the rider falls backwards.
Cochamo Valley, a popular tourist destination in Chilean mountaineering, known as Yosemite in South America, has several granite rock walls and steep slopes.
The peaks offer spectacular views. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly carving new routes between the walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve skiing on snowy terrain using special ski or snowboard equipment attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "homeless skiers", planning all-inclusive ski vacations in a specific location.
The idea of ice skating is very old - cave paintings depicting ice skaters on their heads date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century. In 1861, the first recreational ski clubs were formed in Norway and Austria.
Snowboarding: This activity is also called snowboarding, snowboarding tour or snowboarding.
It is related to alpine skiing or ski mountaineering, the latter being done on slopes and requiring stronger skis and boots.
Think of a cross-country ski trail as similar to a downhill trail.
In good conditions you can cover longer distances on foot, but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without heavy packs and proper skis.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small number of sovereign states. In normal circumstances, travelling to several countries means applying for a visa and going through passport control.
The Shenzhen area, however, behaves a bit like a country in this respect.
To stay in this zone, you can easily cross borders without having your passport checked again at checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define antiques as items that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies geographically, where age restrictions may be shorter in some places such as North America compared to Europe.
Handcrafted items are likely to be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Rearing reindeer is an important livelihood among the Sami and trade-related culture is also important for many other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people were reindeer herders, but lived on fish and game, often with reindeer as livestock.
Today many Sami work in new businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romanies, the word "Karaj" is often considered derogatory due to its negative connotations and misunderstanding of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting falls under a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to advise governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East are likely to be treated differently by Europeans and Arabs.
Consultations in countries include a brief summary of the political situation.
The views presented are often more generic, general and simplified than the wealth of information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for any extreme weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, catastrophic social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and can take different forms, depending on geographical conditions and weather topography.
Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, typhoons, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any extreme weather hazards affecting their area as it affects their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that has been declared a war zone needs to undergo special training.
An Internet search for 'harsh environment cycle' is likely to yield the address of a local company.
The course deals generally with the problems mentioned here but in much more detail and with practical examples.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing and extensive first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with a war zone are rare.
Cruise passengers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
Government's willingness to issue passports without specifying gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents has varied greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more sophisticated in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people should not expect to undergo pre-operative scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the oscillations of waves on a beach, often in the shape of a boulder or similar object.
Due to subsurface uplift, the wave returns accumulate in deeper areas, and a downward current may be generated there.
Most deaths from drowning occur while swimming to shore through the current, which is rare.
