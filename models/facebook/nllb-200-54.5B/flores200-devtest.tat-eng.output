This not only supports the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers but also provides details, such as color or three-dimensionality, that the fossil record usually does not.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was light brown above and light brown or carotenoid below.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers lack the well-developed shaft called the rachis, but they have other features - barbs and barbules - that researchers believe are a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they may have been used for temperature regulation or display rather than flight. The researchers concluded that although the tail belonged to a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen represented adult feathers rather than juvenile feathers.

According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage for the Park before the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first firing operation received clear safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEC) yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth DUI in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former SJC as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections (some as of 2011).
Some 60 incidents of broken iPods were reported, with a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) informed him that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional cases of heat, which it described as "not serious".
The DOJ called Apple's delay in responding "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday) in the Mariana Islands.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage or casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also gave no tsunami warning.
Former Philippine policeman arrested for hijacking Hong Kong tourist bus in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six are now reported dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom was replaced by photographers, and Mendoza was shot dead.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and joined the Women's National Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in her spare time, Liggins began researching preterm birth.
Her research showed that hormone injections can accelerate the development of a baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. She was my first manager.
Dustin "Gold Dust" Runnels said, "Luna was as weird as I was...maybe more so...I will love and miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic were 8 percent more likely than in 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled believe that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, 29 percent thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her form was called into question following complaints.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water and organic compounds that formed proteins and may have supported life on earth.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of the planets, especially the earth, because comets have impacted the earth in the past.
The 53-year-old Cuomo, who took office earlier this year, signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA believes will allow planes to fly shorter routes and reduce carbon emissions while saving millions of gallons of fuel.
Unlike older technology based on ground-based radar, it uses satellite technology to give air traffic controllers more accurate information about the location of aircraft and to give pilots more accurate information.
No trains or subways will stop at Wembley, and there will be no underground parking.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations due to interbreeding between the Darwin's mouse, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus mouse, Geospiza conirostris, although this process was thought to be much longer.
Gold can be shaped into almost any shape, and it can be cast into very small forms.
It can be drawn into thin strips, spun and woven, pounded with a mallet, or woven on a flat surface.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to embellish handwritten illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical's pH indicator, which can be made using red cabbage water.
Cabbage water changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons taken away from them (because hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Stir in two cups of flour, and knead the mixture with clean, damp hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving them an interesting appearance and texture.
At Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths frequented by both men and women in mixed company.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you are using a pager.
The satellite receives the call and reflects it back to earth almost instantly.
Scientists rely on telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere scatters some of the light we see.
Launching a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket more than 100 feet [30 m] high.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and one of the greatest things it has given us is the ability to move much more easily and much more quickly.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a considerable number of small prey such as insects, rodents, ticks, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a home, a job each cat can do without competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three related male lions, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other, older sisters and daughters of the family.
Lion prides often act like packs of wolves or dogs, and these predators have habits very similar to those of lions (but not those of other big cats) and are just as dangerous to their prey.
A tiger is an accomplished all-around athlete - able to climb (albeit not very well), swim, leap great distances, and pull himself up with a force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family as lions, leopards, and jaguars (the family Panthera).
A tiger's roar is not like that of a full-grown lion but is more like a series of harsh, piercing words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots locate potential prey by scent.
Ocelots are excellent at night vision and stealth, hunting large prey by blending in with their surroundings and then catching the prey.
A small group of organisms (a small population) that becomes separated from the original population (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or move to a new island, and therefore cannot easily return) often find themselves in a different environment than they were originally in.
In this new environment there will be different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different functions or adaptations compared to the old one to be strongly competitive.
Old populations don't generally change, they still need old adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it is an inevitable and essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We use plants to make our homes and clothes, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, without which animals could not live.
The mosasaur was the most powerful predator of its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
And it had seventy shoulder-pieces to the one end of it, and seventy teeth to the other end of it; it was so made that nothing escaped.
Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been cannibalistic.
It attacked everything that moved in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would have been no match for it.
Although many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had some unusual foods, including wild boars, peacocks, partridges, and sleepers
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals sitting on couches, while wealthy men had banquets with men reclining on couches.
The ancient Roman diet did not include foods introduced into Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
For each of their deities, the Babylonians built a central temple that was viewed as a house of God.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods by their ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could go.
At times, the temples were joined by pyramidlike towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower served as a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the ancient Middle East, a house was not necessarily the most important thing.
Jewish families spent much of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in front of their houses; the shops had open counters facing the street; the houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, and timber was expensive.
In the Norse sagas, they banish Erik the Red from Iceland for murder, and as he travels west, he finds Greenland and names it Greenland.
Despite his discovery, however, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each is a "Scandinavian country", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland have very different people, kings, customs, and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the card, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776", with the text at the bottom turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that when it was first produced, the huge parchment scroll measuring 29 3‚ÅÑ4 inches by 24 1‚ÅÑ2 inches was folded up for safekeeping.
It is possible, therefore, that the inscription was simply a stylistic addition.
As a result of the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, northern France was liberated, but the south was not.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who, rather than fight, made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for the occupiers.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizenship, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or state, and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations, and civilized cultures are designed to pass on knowledge, leave cultural traces, and be equitably distributed from generation to generation.
Smaller cultures often disappear without proper historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the central government first formed by the thirteen states was weak: under the Articles of Confederation, Congress was its only component.
Congress has no taxing power and, lacking a national executive or judicial system, relies on state agencies to enforce its actions, which often refuse to cooperate.
It also has no authority to override state tax laws or individual state tariffs.
Amendments to the Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states had little control over the federal government, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world, along with Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians have competed in international games and the Olympics.
Japan includes some 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago" because of its cluster of islands.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch West India Company, based in southwestern Taiwan, changed Aboriginal seed production practices and employed Chinese on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the grounds have been restored to give visitors a better idea of what they once looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues.
For example, the world's most common still image photography format is 35 mm, which dominated the recent analog film era.
It is still in production today, but its most significant aspect ratio has shifted to image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is actually quite unusual.
The aspect ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to make the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or close to these aspect ratios.
Often misused and ridiculed, the rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the picture.
It suggests that the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal triangles (see illustration).
During this period in European history, the wealth and power of the Catholic Church came to the fore.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity held Europe together despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are collected for that very reason.
The church had been headquartered in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth in one place led many to question whether this principle applied.
Shortly after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved effective - vital military and civilian terminals were cut, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined an entire section of the ocean - international waters - to make it inaccessible to ships, even those of neutral nations.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nationalities.
After seeing the horror and brutality of the first world war, the nations resolved to prevent such tragedies from happening again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States at the invitation of the Edison Company of New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former employer, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time, with each period or ruling family establishing a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability of the provinces scattered between each dynasty. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During this period, many nobles fought bitterly for control of the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying for the privilege of occupying the highest seat in the Great Hall of the People in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, opening the way for the most ambitious and successful to achieve their goal.
This applies to military service as well, where ranks in the army, formerly based on class, are now assigned according to inherent qualities.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this mortal world. He often went to meditate in a cave on the mountain of "Nur" (light), later known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, clearly illustrates Muhammad's spiritual quest.
Located in the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even those who know of its existence find it difficult to find.
From the top of the cave, you can see and hear only a fraction of the world around you.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the original Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidlike structures erected in memory of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau of Egypt's Valley of the Dead, or the "Giza Necropolis", contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in memory of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up arrow" looks like a V, and the "down arrow" looks like a square with no bottom.
In the example above, you would start at the tip and work your way toward the arrow; in the example below, you would start at the tip and work your way toward the arrow.
Usually, the upper bow produces a softer sound, while the lower makes a louder sound.
You can make your own signs, but bear in mind that arrows are printed for musical purposes and usually command respect.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and four-year-old Louis-Charles, and the king's niece, Madame √âlisabeth, were driven from Versailles back to Paris by a group of market women.
The carriage they were riding in to Paris was surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
A mob forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
At one point, a member of the group waved the head of a royal guard who had been executed at Versailles before the startled queen.
The cost of US imperialism's war to conquer the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the cost and interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute a major benefit to U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it is helpful to understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period is commonly called the High Middle Ages - the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 C.E.) in the history of Europe.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide spectrum of ideas in practice: from the technological drive or technological imperative to the strict understanding that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic bound to scientific laws and their reflection in technology.
Most interpreters of technological determinism agree on two main points: that the development of technology itself largely occurs outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, "influences" native societies rather than being socially constructed.
For example, it might be said that the motor led to the development of the automobile.
However, the country's road network was not economically viable for very few cars, so new manufacturing techniques were developed to reduce the cost of owning an automobile.
Mass ownership of automobiles has also led to more accidents on the roads, which has led to the development of new medical techniques to repair damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, geography gave rise to customs and culture that were better suited to the society's location than arbitrarily imposed laws.
While Paris was the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of prosperity began about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
During the 12th century, its prestige declined, largely because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices that were more expensive than those offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the capital of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing in the East was heavily influenced by the Byzantine Empire.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own styles.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, primarily organic system that uses stored seeds that are native to an ecoregion and crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still true in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of community.
Subcultures may differ based on the age, nationality, class, location, and/or gender of the participants.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a subculture often signal their participation in it in distinctive and symbolic ways through stylistic appropriation, including fashion, customs, and slang.
One of the most common ways to show the importance of socialization is to cite several tragic examples of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, unhappiness, or deliberate abuse while growing up.
Some abused children have been deprived of their liberty by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this neglect is because the parents do not accept that the child has a serious mental or physical disability.
Abused children may suffer serious abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Others are thought to have been domesticated by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by fully non-human animals, a feral child almost always behaves exactly like a concrete animal (subject to physical limitations), including fears and indifference towards humans.
If project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is more of a support technique than a teaching method, supporting people who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical, so in other words, the teacher can be a form of scaffolding, a human being like a little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding tools are embedded within the software and are designed to ask questions, make suggestions, and explain procedures that may be difficult for the learner to perform on their own.
Children are placed with other families for a variety of reasons, ranging from abuse to mistreatment and even threats.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where he or she is deprived of discipline, care, and education.
We view the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The adoptive family has the responsibility to address any needs that the children might not have had in their previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of use and enjoyment.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Agee and McCord (1998) in their study of audience reactions to websites.
Video recording has made important advances in the field of microlensing, the interpretation of facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that a person's lying can be detected by correctly interpreting microbeliefs.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks noted that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still detect sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, may have the ability to interpret human behavior in this way.
Research during the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination transfer variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to obtain amino acids from plant sources.
Not only that, but failure to do so has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources are the proteins in leaves and beans, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also rich in protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our distant ancestors may have solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep onset is the process of intentionally awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will not wake you up.
If you find that your alarm clock goes off while you are sleeping, set it in another part of the room and get out of bed to turn it off.
Other variations based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known sedative) before bedtime to restore the person to urination.
The amount of peace that a person enjoys in his heart is in direct contrast with the amount of stress that he experiences in his body and mind.
The less stress you have, the more positive life force you have, and the more potential you have for absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way is our own negativity and tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the realization of enlightenment occurs.
After the war, the clash of systems, processes, and cultures led to a breakdown in relations between the two countries.
Within two years of the war's end, former colleagues had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last 40 years and include physical wars involving foreign armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been crushed, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian front.
Almost overnight, however, these plans were rendered obsolete when the Soviet Union, with over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army, invaded Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements, forming the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Shipping is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the navy is usually to ensure that its country's ability to move people and goods is maintained, but at the same time to prevent the enemy from being able to move people and goods.
One of the clearest recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans sought to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to assist Great Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, largely by submarine, struggled to stem the tide.
If the Allies failed, Germany could probably invade Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began raising animals for their milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in pastures that ran along hillsides or other pasture lands, and were often raised by children or teenagers who were called "herders" in the secular world.
Baggage carts were developed in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the chariot's wheels were made of only parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses pulling the chariots to accelerate and to pull heavy loads over the rough roads of the day.
Mats were introduced early on to hold the rails in place, and then gradually, as sheet iron covered the wheel tracks, it became clear that the wheel tracks would be more efficient.
This became a common practice, but iron made wooden wheels wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and the first fully iron rails appeared in 1767.
Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not normally walk upright.
Many sites of specialization have been identified in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering.
However, if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to get to the root of the problem and stop it before it escalates.
Scientific and technological advances have changed the world dramatically, while overpopulation and extravagant life-styles have added to the problems.
After its adoption by the Convention, the draft was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away on July 4, signed by the president, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made of what came to be known as the Dunlap Codex.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy of the document was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 leaves of the Dunlap Codex are the oldest known extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are still many dinosaurlike birds.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious, and the symptoms, such as vomiting, may be so general as to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is the presence of open containers of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The roots of the term can be traced back to the earliest known example of a parasitic wasp.
Both dragonflies and damselflies are parasitic insects that have adapted to live in a nest or on a host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, a neurological disorder that affects middle-aged and older people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
One study found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
The couple may decide that it is in their best interests and in the best interests of the child to terminate the custody arrangement.
Such couples may decide to make arrangements to adopt a child of their own.
At the time of adoption, the biological parents forfeit their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's legal parents.
The ultimate goal of science is to discover how the world works by using the scientific method, which, in fact, underlies most scientific research.
However, it is not the only kind of experiment. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, to make observations, or to test a scientific hypothesis.
Naturalists and philosophers paid close attention to the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views came to be accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became increasingly cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythms observed in the physiology and behavior of living things are closely linked to the production of these cycles by biological clocks, often because of the presence of endogenous cycles.
Not only responses to external temporal cues, but also recorded temporal rhythms involving bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they measured the DNA of a phage by detecting the protein of the phage in radioactive phosphorus or sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the area of genetic material affected, and the significance of the cells affected by the embryonic cell.
Only mutations in embryonic cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in entering natural areas because of their admiration for nature, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo is one example.
Every morning in small towns, people leave their cars to go to work and are met by other commuters.
In this mobile transportation network, everyone is connected to and supportive of a transportation system based on the private automobile.
Science has now shown that this large-scale carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of the steady state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in public life and uses transportation systems, yet almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, you will rarely hear such complaints about poor water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints? Why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers competent? Or is something more fundamental being done?
Traffic flow is the study of the behavior of drivers, the movement of vehicles between two destinations, and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave reasonably efficiently within a consistent range. Thus, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented by mathematical numbers.
To visualize the flow of traffic, three key characteristics were identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape from their domesticates and more efficiently find food and mates.
One advantage of most insects is their ability to fold their wings back over their body.
This allows them to find more and smaller places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot retract their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some agreed with him, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and possibly other stars).
That sounds plausible, for the earth does not seem to wobble, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's longest and largest river, carrying eight times as much water as the next-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of all the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were surpassed in size and technical perfection by none.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired monuments built more than a thousand years before their time.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest sovereign state and the least densely populated.
In Vatican City, Italian is the language of law and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of much of the working population, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The simple chemical elements gold, silver, and copper have long been known to man because they can be found in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he thought they changed into new substances to form the things we see.
And alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and remember, there are a lot of elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then there are metals like silver and gold.
In some cases, they contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
As a result, the pencil soon became a valued companion to many.
Sadly, as new writing techniques developed, the pencil's importance and frequency of use declined.
People now write letters on computer screens and never go near an airplane.
When something new comes along, we can only dream about what it will become.
The nuclear bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a large number of protons and neurons into a nucleus.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a mountain.
Some atoms are inherently unstable, meaning that they tend to break apart with little or no outside interference.
The moon's surface is composed of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under maria and thicker under high mountains.
In the open field, there may be more maria because the crust is thinner, allowing the lava to rise to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or engage.
According to these theories, individuals have specific needs and/or desires that are satisfied as they mature.
These theories study how the actions of certain people are influenced and what events in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
The two most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, when leaders begin to manage their former colleagues, two types of attitudes may emerge. At one end of the spectrum is the desire to remain "one of the boys (or girls)".
Such leaders have difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is the person who becomes unrecognizable, the man or woman who thinks that everything the team has ever done needs to be fundamentally changed and made their own.
As a result, the leader takes full responsibility for the team's success or failure.
This often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
Virtual team members are often the focal point of physical teams working together.
They are more independent than typical team members because they can meet despite different time zones, even when local instructions may not be understood.
Another unique component of the viral team is that it is a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is a governing body to which each member is accountable. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to go through a process that takes time to get to a learning state? One purpose of implementing the concept of a learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can occur when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
Thus, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier may result in a new innovative way of meeting user needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organized learning.
Angel (2006) defines the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition, thereby broadening the scope of the study and greatly increasing its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior has helped scientists in their search.
It has long been known that trauma, injury, and tumors in the brain affect cognition and alter certain mental functions.
Advances in technology have enabled us to see structures and processes in the brain that were previously invisible.
It provides us with a wealth of information and material with which to build simulation models that help us understand the workings of our minds.
Artificial intelligence, while having a strong science fiction flavor, forms a very important branch of computer science responsible for machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior on the part of machines.
Such examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to user needs and questions, and handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become subject areas that provide solutions to real-life problems.
Several home computing and video game software-based artificial intelligence systems are currently in use in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Tours are an integral part of each lesson, and often the teacher wants to take his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology has made it possible for students to take a virtual tour of a museum, an aquarium, or a beautiful work of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create an annual website about their trip to the state capital. It is updated annually, but older versions are stored online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs also help readers improve their writing skills. While readers often start a blog with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the audience.
Since readers are often the most demanding audience, a blogger may try to improve the way he writes in order to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging "forces readers to better explore the world around them". The need to maintain the audience's attention motivates readers to be intelligent and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a way to encourage collaboration and encourage students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "enables readers to increase their analytical and critical thinking. By actively responding to Internet material, readers can identify their own views in the context of other posts and form their own opinions on specific issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa, Canada's delightful bilingual capital, is filled with galleries and museums that depict Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muscogee and others.
All of this and more underscores the fact that Ontario is perceived by outsiders as truly Canadian.
The vast areas of the far north are sparsely populated and, in some places, completely barren.
A startling demographic comparison: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, the most unique continent.
Many of the smaller islands are either independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was introduced by the Arabs, and it flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama charted the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women travelers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be beneficial (as long as it does not make the ring seem too expensive).
Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, there may be situations that could be considered harassment, and such harassment is common, such as holding hands, etc.
Firmly reject the man's advances, and do not be afraid to stand up for your beliefs - cultural or otherwise.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Barbary fishermen, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and renamed it Daru-l-Badiya, but Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tiaras, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and many other trinkets, but these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano spewed lava that flooded many of Goma's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, to understand the fighting in North Kivu, it is necessary to study all the cases of departure from Goma.
Besides being one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas, the town is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo.
A typical (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Although relatively inaccessible, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but because of its status, it is a tourist attraction with an airport.
In 1990 it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the sand dunes.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, "The Wonders of the African World".
The city stands out because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different wildlife and vegetation.
It is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks), being one of South Africa's major attractions.
As with all national parks in South Africa, there is a daily environmental fee and an entrance fee.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
The territory takes its name from Hong Kong Island, which is a major tourist attraction.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong can be likened to a shimmering histogram, vividly illustrated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, head out to Kowloon Beach, across the island.
Much of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in the densely built-up areas along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists claimed the land, and so it's a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of the area.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal area of mangroves, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in India is designated as the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps but also include the last remnants of the dense jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is wetland or swamp.
Designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1966, the Sundarbans is now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) to the district throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta or Bumtang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses to the circuit are often full, tickets must be purchased several days in advance.
Comfortable and reliable small Japanese Coaster buses operate in most areas.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oyapock, Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The twin towers are 272 feet [83 m] high and have two lanes, each measuring 1,200 feet [378 m] long and 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the Brazilian customs posts.
The Guarani, the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, were nomadic hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous people, such as the Guaycura and Payagua, who were hunter-gatherers and fishermen.
Originally called the Province of the Indian Giant, Paraguay was born in the 16th century as a result of a conflict between Spanish conquistadores and local tribes.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve its indigenous mentality and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December on the Las Ca√±itas polo fields.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches may be held.
News about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches can be found on the website of the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, opposite FIC West in Stanley.
British pounds are commonly accepted for payment throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted as well.
Although British or U.S. currency may be accepted on outlying islands, credit cards may not be; check with the owners beforehand to see which method of payment would be acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange money before leaving.
Montevideo lies south of the equator, so when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer here, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where summer temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30¬∞C].
Winters can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but wind and humidity can make them seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons, and rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.
Although the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend a distance of at least 100 yards [100 m] and 25 yards [25 m] from bears and wolves!
Bison, wild boars, bears, and all other large animals may attack, no matter how docile they seem.
These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so allow them freedom of action.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing in or preparing food that smells bad, and keep your camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The strait was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the strait.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town ended with the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Located between two bays, Auckland has many beaches, three of which are particularly popular.
The northern coastal beaches (in the North Harbour area) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on WaitematƒÅ Harbour in the prestigious Central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a variety of shops lining the shoreline.
The name of the main local beer is "Number One", which is simple but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably the most popular.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are in doubt, bottled water is readily available.
The concept of a "light white" coffee is foreign to Australians, as black coffee is served with a small amount of espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality, and the juice is expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries resulting from these are rare.
Nevertheless, obey the instructions of the authorities, follow all posted signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Since the 1770's, northern right whales have been sighted on beaches and estuaries from October to April, and occasionally beyond.
Sharks have been sighted in the area, but attacks on humans are rare, and most shark species swim away in fear of humans.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking ahead gives the traveler confidence that when he arrives at his destination, he will have a place to stay.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with well-known hotels, but through a travel agency you may be able to book other types of accommodations, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or a combination of flight and hotel.
They may also hold your reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to apply for other travel documents (such as a visa).
However, any adjustments or requirements must first be made through the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, many music festival attendees choose to camp together, and many attendees find this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be closer to the action, you should arrive early to get a seat near the music.
Keep in mind that while the music may have ended at the main stages, in some places it will continue late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice creates a tremendous noise, especially for sensitive people.
Cruise passengers are exempt from the need to obtain a visa (please specify conditions).
Casinos usually try to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find a way out.
To make sure that guests are comfortable and stay for the duration of the gathering, there are often special offers of food, drink, and entertainment.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages at the club's expense, but drunkenness affects the mind, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to trek in high latitudes or through mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall to cover the ground in a short time.
Visibility may be reduced by heavy snow or ice on the ground, as well as by condensation or ice on the windshield.
On the other hand, in many parts of the world, hail and snow are the norm, and transportation is virtually nonstop year-round.
A safari is perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
In the wild, the term "safari" refers to a journey overland to view Africa's spectacular wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk close to vehicles, and simple equipment helps to make them easier to see.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards may occasionally be fearful of humans, so you may want to use binoculars to get a better look.
A safari (also known as a bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk, bushwalk
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at other venues across Japan.
The city of Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice on its territory, as it was the first to do so in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in for a surprise.
Cancellation policies vary, but given the situation at the end of March, most of the cancellation policies generated by the coronavirus do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to range from 2,500 to 130,000 yuan.
Many hotels offer temporary use of an iron and an ironing board, even when guests are not in the room.
And if ye have not braided hair, or if ye cannot be bothered to spread [a garment], then clothe yourselves.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this could cause shrinkage or, in a worst-case scenario, burns).
There are various methods of treating water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes only a minute; in others, several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are in doubt, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter wildlife that is unfamiliar to them.
Worms can cause food poisoning, skin rashes, allergic reactions, and even infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force usually do not qualify as predators.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in a particular location.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes leave behind large sums of money, especially for such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway to navigate, and it often traverses isolated terrain.
If you are not used to walking on country roads, be patient. There are steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are much lower than on the front and rear sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict enforcement is more important than in other cases.
Interestingly, mobile connectivity is much better here than on other sections of the route (such as Pennsylvania Wilds).
German pastries are excellent, and Bavaria, like its southern neighbor Austria, is rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are a common sight: apples are baked all year round, and chilies and plums are produced in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you prefer a smaller but more substantial pastry, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krappen, depending on your region.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables prepared with herbs and spices.
Depending on the ingredients, curry can be either "dry" or "wet".
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
The cuisine of Indonesia, a nation of some 17,000 islands, is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of local dishes that can be found throughout the country.
However, when used without qualifiers, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is widespread throughout the archipelago and includes many simple, spicy dishes. Spices preferred by Javanese include peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the ephod; and the staves shall be for receptacles for the staves, for the staves of the ephod.
They provide stability for the rider, but they can be dangerous because the rider's legs can become entangled.
If the rider's legs get entangled in a stream after being thrown by a horse, precautions can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the rider's stumbling.
First, most riders wore high-heeled, smooth-soled boots with relatively narrow hems.
In addition, some saddles, notably English saddles, have protective arches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The valley of Cochamo, known as Yosemite in South America, is Chile's main rock-climbing destination.
Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails through the boundless potential of the walls.
Mountain sports, including skiing, snowboarding, and cross-country skiing, are popular.
Skiing is a major tourist attraction, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski idlers", devote a whole vacation to skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is ancient - there are rock carvings of skiers dating back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club in Australia was established by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as wilderness skiing, cross-country skiing, or ski tourism.
It is related to, but usually excludes, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is practiced on steep mountain slopes and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you may be able to cover longer distances than you would on foot - but you will rarely be able to match the speed of backpackers on paved roads.
Although Europe is a comparatively small continent made up of many independent countries, under normal circumstances travel across several countries would require many visas and passport controls.
However, the Schengen area is more like a single country.
Once inside this zone, travelers normally do not have to go through passport control at border crossings.
Also, with a Schengen visa, there is no need to apply separately for a visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities classify goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
This definition may vary by geographic location, and in places such as North America, new items may be considered antiques, as opposed to Europe.
An artifact may be considered an antique even if it is a later creation than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is a source of livelihood for the Sami, and reindeer culture is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived by fishing, hunting, etc., and reindeer were mainly caught for food.
Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of S√°pmi.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Gypsies, it is often considered derogatory because of negative stereotypes and inaccurate descriptions of Gypsies.
If a travel advisory applies to a country you plan to visit, it may affect your travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can also consult the advice of non-governmental organizations that provide advice specifically for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, encounter situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations simply outline the political situation in the country.
The points presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic in comparison with the detailed information presented elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather condition that causes damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Local and seasonal extreme weather events include windstorms, blizzards, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to check their itinerary for possible extreme weather conditions that could affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that might be viewed as a war zone is required to undergo training.
An Internet search for "survival training in a hostile environment" may bring up the address of a local company.
The course usually includes a much more in-depth study of all the subjects discussed and usually includes practical training.
The course usually lasts from two to five days and includes role-playing, extensive first-aid training, and occasional weapons training.
Books and magazines about wildlife abound, but few focus on war zones.
Travelers planning sex-change operations abroad should ensure that they have valid travel documents for their return.
Issuing a passport without an X mark or renewing a passport with the desired name and gender varies from country to country.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents also varies.
Checkpoints also became much more frequent in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people undergoing surgery should expect that their privacy and dignity will be violated as they undergo the scans.
Rip currents are currents caused by waves that break against the shore, often against underwater rocks or similar objects.
Depending on the underwater topology, the reverse current is concentrated in a few deep areas, where a fast current can be generated in deep water.
