While an experimental vaccine appears to have the potential to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, so far, no drug has been conclusively shown to be effective for the treatment of this infectious disease.
One mixture of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in experiments, but formal studies showed it provided less benefit than expected in terms of preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as the standard of comparison, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.

Not only does this confirm a popular hypothesis that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides details that the fossil record cannot, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists suggest that the plumage of this species is chestnut brown above and grayish blue or yellow/orange below.
The discovery also provides an insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
"Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed body of feathers called a plumage, but had other characteristics of feathers - silk and feathers - the researchers suggested that the plumage may have been a later evolutionary development with these other characteristics".
The structure of the plumage suggests that the feathers were not used for flight but for body temperature control or for display.
The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult bird and not those of a chicken.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said nineteen of those injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a Daesh (ISIL) militant was responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun behaves according to the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in this system is concluded to be driven by self-luminosity, self-rotation and nothing else.
Both luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the inverse magnetic field.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for would be created by tidal attraction between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant "has a very high level of concern and alarm due to its very high fatality rate".
Dr. Moll thinks that some of the patients may have been infected in the hospital and at least two were medical personnel in the hospital.
Over the course of a year, one infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, it appears that the proportion of XDR-TB in the total number of people with TB remains low; only 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people are infected at any given time in South Africa.

The government has also promised to provide several million doses of encephalitis vaccine to help health authorities prepare for next year.
Planned vaccine distribution this year to the previously worst-affected areas has been delayed due to lack of funding and lack of priority over other diseases.

In France, voting has long been a low-tech affair: each voter enters a separate voting booth, leaves a printed sheet of paper with the name of the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the staff verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral roll.
The French electoral law is quite strict in systematizing the proceedings.
Since 1988 ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were available at the start of voting and that no envelopes were added except those of valid and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the entire process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to a special procedure.

This practice is very common in England but Scotland is different, and the law and the courts here have held that the distribution of images can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "perhaps journalists are really on a dangerous path in publishing images, etc., of suspects".
The Public Prosecutor's Office, in overall charge of the prosecution, has informed journalists that there will be no comment at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, would mention the border conflict, which the Palestinians want based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed reportedly included the future status of spiritual Jerusalem with both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded a continued military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement was signed while the Palestinian Authority only agreed to a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplemental pest control pilot program were closely monitored by forestry officials as the pilot program was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
As part of a partnership agreement between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's recruitment program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Service, the four shooters selected for the first firing had undergone comprehensive training and instruction in safety principles.
Martelly was sworn into the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Commission created by Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move to a new electoral period for the country.
The order was Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that had spread since October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from the organization of failed elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 documented cases of iPod portable music players overheating, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company described as "not serious".
In response to the announcement, the ministry called Apple's delay of the report an "extremely regrettable" development.
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT, Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken several tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
As well as the Filipino photographers, six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly woman when she needed the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered medicine.
He trained in obstetrics and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During her time at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm birth in her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was injected, the fetus's lung growth rate would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the plane's two 'black boxes' on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed their gratitude to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Unique as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna is just as scary as I am...maybe more so...I love her and will miss her...hope she is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard in her 2010 federal election campaign said she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
According to the poll, 29% of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaint, his fitness was not guaranteed.
He cannot take pain medication because such drugs have been banned from use in the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper is a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, who discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the detection with different hardware and software in early February and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially the Earth, were formed by comets striking the Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political chatter and folly".
There were rumors that you were going to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions upon millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses basic satellite technology as opposed to basic multi-ground-out technology that allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and gives pilots more accurate information.
No additional vehicles have been deployed and ground trains will not stop at Wembley and there are no car parks and transit car parks in the area.
Concerns over lack of transportation raised the possibility the match would be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans of this team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new species of bird on Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species evolved in just two generations although the process is thought to have taken much longer, due to a combination of Darwin's sparrow, the Geospiza genus, and the migratory Geospiza species.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be crafted into very small objects.
It can be pulled into thin strands for twisting and braiding. It can be pounded or rolled into sheets.
It can be coated very thinly and plated onto other metals. It can be coated so thinly that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "glittering manuscripts".
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Vegetable juice changes color according to the acid or base (alkaline) concentration of the chemical.
The pH is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had an electron removed (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Twist two pieces of dry powder together, and squeeze them into a ball with wet, clean hands.
"The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers to make them feel foreign and molded into a kind of shell".
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a drainage ditch connected to an elaborate system of canals.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared use.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up the call and then bounce it back, almost instantaneously.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images we see.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has brought to our lives is that it has made travel and transportation much easier and much faster.
It gave us trains, cars and many other forms of transportation.
At a lower level are medium-sized members of the cat family, which prey on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat small prey in large numbers such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special job each cat has to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three related adult males along with about thirty females and their offspring.
"Women tend to be closer to each other in a family with many sisters and daughters".
Packs of lions act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very dangerous to prey.
Like an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well), swim, leap, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are grouped with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four families of cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like that of a lion, but a series of throat-clearing growls.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that the South American jungle cat tracks and finds its prey by scent, sniffing each place where the prey has been.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move skillfully, unnoticed.
When a small group of living organisms (in small numbers) becomes separated from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or to an island so far from where they came from that it is difficult for them to return), this group of organisms will often perceive that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptive abilities to become a more powerful competitor than they were before.
The original population is completely unchanged, they still need adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable and extremely important consequence of evolution.
Trees produce the oxygen we breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The pangolin was the apex predator during its existence, so it feared nothing, except other pangolins.
Its long jaw is fitted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and a set of molars in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it probably had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a predator.
It also attacked everything in the water; even giant dinosaurs like T. rex were no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans shared some strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a squirrel.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on chairs to eat, the rich preferred to hold feasts together and recline to eat.
Ancient Roman meals did not feature foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
For each god, the Babylonians built a central temple that served as his home.
People would bring offerings to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an outer shrine courtyard and an inner shrine chapel that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes distinctive pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the pyramid was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing is not so important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time living outdoors.
Women cook in the courtyard; new shops open onto the street; stone is used to build houses.
There are no large forests in Canaan, so wood is very expensive here.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that on his way west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes lived there at that time.
Despite being 'Scandinavian' countries, there are many differences in people, kings, customs and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776", which appear at the bottom of the text, upside down.
Although no one is certain of the document's authorship, it is known that in its early days, the document written on this large (293⁄4 inches long and 241⁄2 inches wide) sheet of goatskin was rolled up for preservation.
So it's possible that captions are added simply as a bookmark.
The Allied landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France but the south was not yet free.
The area was ruled by the French "Vichy" Government. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and joined hands with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched "Operation Dragoon", the invasion of southern France.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a distinctive culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning of the people, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also partly determines the size of society.
The culture of the civilization contained the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a cultural imprint that survived and spread well.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving valid historical evidence and without being recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states established a loose central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have any power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state legislatures to enforce its decisions.
It also had no authority to amend the tariff laws or to levy taxes between the states.
The charter required consensus from all states before amendment, and the states underestimated the central government to such an extent that state representatives were frequently absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world being the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
"Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions with Italians competing in the international arena and Olympic events".
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to its archipelago, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors sailed past and recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began to change the grain cultivation practices of the local people and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice fields and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Gates.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, the film size prevalent before the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today but more importantly the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is in fact 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS-format sets) equal or nearly approximate this frame rate.
The often ridiculed and abused rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while still serving as a measure of a photograph's order.
According to this rule, the most useful location for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has been the connecting thread between European nations, despite lingering differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church endowments exist for that purpose.
The church's headquarters have been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether the above doctrine is being followed.
After the outbreak of war, Britain immediately implemented a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective through cutting off military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade has violated widely accepted international law, conventional by many international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain dropped mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, endangering even neutral ships.
There was little reaction to this tactic, so Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing view of almost every citizen and nation was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and brutality of World War I, nations were eager to avoid a repetition of such atrocities in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
"He came to America with four cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different dates; each Chinese period or dynasty held power corresponding to a different dynasty.
In addition, there were periods of instability between dynasties when the country was divided, most notably the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce warfare occurred among the many wars between nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying just to claim the throne in the great palace at Xi'an.
There were many political and social implications such as the use of numerical systems, the shift from autocratic monarchies to republics, nationalism and the belief that the country belonged to the people rather than to a particular ruler.
Also after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all men seeking employment, allowing the most ambitious to succeed.
This is also true in the military because military ranks are based on merit rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working classes in other countries to rise up in revolt.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave called "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (Light) to meditate.
Surviving the passage of time, the Hira preserves a vivid image of the spiritual tendency that Muhammad left behind.
Located on top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's completely impossible to find even if you knew it existed.
There was nothing but a high, clear, beautiful sky surrounding the mountains. A small world known and heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Tombs has many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many monuments and statues of the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's pharaohs and family members.
The "bow up" mark looks like a V and the "bow down" mark looks like a pin or square missing its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip of the pick and push the pick up, and down means you should start at the slide (where your hand holds the pick) and pull the pick down.
The upstroke generally produces a softer sound, while the downstroke produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to mark it up, but remember the printed arcs all have musical significance, so respect them.
On 6 October 1789, while at the palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged 4) and their sister Madame Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris in panic by a crowd of market women.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
There was a man in the crowd who waved the head of a royal soldier killed at the Palace of Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to pay for much of the spending and interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits obtained from the exploitation of the Filipino people for a long time became the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar organization, one must understand the context that prompted its birth.
The era in which these events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide variety of ideas in practice, from technological drive or technological coercion to the narrower sense that human destiny is controlled by an underlying system of logic linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path of its own, uninfluenced by culture and politics, and that technology adversely "affects" preexisting societies, rather than social conditions.
For example, one could say that motorized cars inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for a few cars, so new manufacturing methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Excessive car ownership has also led to an increase in traffic accidents, which in turn has led to the development of new medical techniques to repair physical injuries.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual and over time the customs and culture associated with that area developed and these combined with social status remained better than dictatorial rules imposed.
In the same way that Paris was called the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was famous as the focal point of opulence that began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The city's status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned gifts of silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to delayed communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, one of the most important developments at that time was that people started to use buttons.
Subsistence farming is a form of farming practised only to provide just enough food for the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually only organic fertilizer, using stored seeds of native plant varieties that are suitable for crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Group culture brings together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social norms and helps them gain a sense of community.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The factors that define different regional cultures may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express relationships through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles such as fashion, speech, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite a few unfortunate cases of children involved in neglect, unhappiness, or deliberate abuse, lacking social contact from their caregivers as adults.
Some feral children have been kept in captivity by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to parental rejection of the severely mentally or physically impaired child.
Stray children may have been cruelly abused or traumatized before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, Scaffolding education goes one step further.
Modeling is not a learning method but a means of assisting people who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The curriculum can be physical or virtual, in other words, the teacher is a kind of curriculum but as a little virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolds method is internalized in software and is intended to question, prompt, and explain processes that may challenge students to solve problems on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from lack of interest to abuse or even rape.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment without the nurturing, care and education that they are currently experiencing.
We found the foster care system to be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable educational environments, and reliable health care.
A home is seen as a place that provides the essentials that your previous home did not.
The Internet combines elements of both public and private communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to many new aspects of how to use and approach contentment.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relevance" were also seen as new motivational directions according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they conducted a survey of your reading response to online sites.
The use of video cameras has yielded important insights into the interpretation of fleeting expressions, which are facial movements that occur within a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it's been suggested that a person can detect when someone is lying by accurately interpreting tiny gestures.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks shows how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that these abilities to interpret human behavior might also be present in other animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variants: recessive and dominant.
Mutation adds new genetic variation and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination went back and forth between the two groups through each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its requirement for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so can lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the protein found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide abundant protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to modern-day bonobos.
Sleep intervention is the process of deliberately waking a person during his or her normal sleep time and returning to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using an alarm clock of the almost silent type to help you wake up without being fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it in another corner of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on circadian rhythms include drinking plenty of water (specifically filtered water or tea, which is known to be a diuretic) before bed that will cause us to wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stresses that the body and mind endure.
The less stress there is, the more positive energy there is, and everyone has the potential to find ultimate peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the compassionate path of Mahayana Buddhism and many Indian Yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
Central to Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing the forms of various deities, clean energy fields, chakras are activated and a sense of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies were once again enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defences were broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops moved in and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is currently the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods by sea.
The traditional mission of naval forces is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's ability to transport people and goods, while, at the same time, interfering with the movement of people and goods of the enemy.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The United States attempted to ferry supplies and troops across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy also used U-boats to try to stop the flow of shipping.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered England after having conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping these animals for their milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats are often raised in herds that roam the hills or other grazing areas, mostly led by children or teenagers, similar to sheep herding.
Carriage roads were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull at faster speeds and carry larger loads than would be possible on everyday rough roads.
Bracing was known fairly early to hold the rails in place, however, it was gradually realized that these rails would work more efficiently if there was a small piece of metal at the top.
This became the norm, however the iron made the fast horse wheel more fragile.
"Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced".
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, which began two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
Characteristics of bipedalism are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to reduce the burden on the future to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms of many diseases, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and find a way to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of human achievements in science and technology, and the problems have also been exacerbated by overpopulation and an unrestrained life-style.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the handwritten manuscript signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 prints were created overnight, today known as the "Dunlap Print".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets are believed to be the oldest surviving photographs of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
A lot of people don't think of these animals as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet birds have many things in common with dinosaurs.
Their legs have scales and claws. They lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost every computer we use today is based on the transformation of information encoded in binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary sequences - or "bits", as used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are often not sufficient to form the basis of an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of organ poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a toxic drug or household chemical.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in the formal sense to name this group of insects.
The term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, an insect species highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both bloodsuckers and bed bugs are late migrants, adapting to live in nests or living on hosts.
Across the United States, there are currently about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This number has made Multiple Sclerosis the leading common neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
MS affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study found that women were twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child to have a child.
These couples have decided to plan for adoption.
In an adoption agreement, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method has in fact guided most scientific research.
However not only experiment and experimentation is an experiment used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses pose questions and make observations also indicative for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Acceptance was Aristotle's view on all matters related to science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in psychology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and the generation of these rhythms through the biological clock.
Circulatory rhythms, not simply responses to external circulatory signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue cycling freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first convincing demonstrations that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phagocytes, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to mark DNA sequences inside the phage with a radioactive phosphorus compound or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene segment affected, and whether or not the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in bacterial lineage cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts tourists who enjoy visiting natural areas so that they can immerse themselves in the natural landscape with its plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns to go to work and pass other people who are going to the same place they just left to go to work.
In a shuttle transportation system, everyone is connected to and supports a shuttle transportation system with their own car.
Today, science suggests that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the steady state that has allowed humans to evolve over the past two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everybody complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause complaints, why do they fail so often? Are transportation engineers not qualified? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic flow because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately drivers tend to behave within the appropriate range; so traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better simulate traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This allows them to hide in small spaces to escape predators.
Today, the only true flightless birds are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
And this makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second-longest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times as much as six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans originates in the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 mi) long.[1] It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of the Stone Pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never able to surpass their size and perfect construction techniques.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the works of their ancestors that still stood a thousand years later.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communication.
Italian was used as an everyday language by those working in the state while Latin was used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of them can be detected in nature in their pure form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are made from a combination of one or more of four elements, earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he hypothesizes that they transform into new matter to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that a trillion atoms could be as small as the period at the end of this sentence.
So from its earliest days, the pencil has been a good friend to many.
Sadly, as new methods of writing appeared, the pencil gradually lost ground and was used less and less.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, never having to touch a pencil sharpener again.
One can only wonder what will be the fate of this keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle of using energy to combine the nucleus of an atom with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, breaking it down again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart with little or no effect.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometres (43 mi) thick on the left side and about 100 kilometres (62 mi) thick on the lunar far side.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker at higher elevations.
There may be more impact basins on adjacent slopes because the crust is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people pay attention or engage with them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired from the outside as they mature.
These theories look at what motivates some people to do what they want and whether there are environmental factors that cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can occur when a manager begins to lead former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying forms of discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and keeping people working responsibly.
Some people will turn into a completely different person and feel they have to change everything that the team is doing and doing on their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This sometimes leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Remote teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still small differences.
Virtual team members often assume the function as point of contact for real team members close to them.
They often have more autonomy than regular members because their teams may meet on different time frames, which may not be sympathetic to their local management.
The presence of real "invisible teams" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each member will report.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One goal for putting organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
So the process of organizations working together to overcome some obstacle can lead to new processes of innovation to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation as well as the sharing of knowledge and inquiry across the collective.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive investigation, so it narrows the scope of the study and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior provides support for scientists in their research.
We've known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in certain neurological functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand brain processes.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is of great significance in science fiction, AI also shapes a hugely important branch of computer science, processing behaviors, being capable of learning and sensing and simulating intelligence in machines.
Artificial Intelligence research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become rules in their own right, focused on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
Today's AI systems are commonly used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as in many home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of the classroom. Teachers quite often take students to places where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology provides a solution with virtual reality tours where students can see museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing the trip online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future students.
For example, each year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. When they start blogging, these students often make grammar and spelling mistakes due to carelessness, the presence of readers generally changes that.
Students are often the harshest critics so the bloggers started trying to improve the quality of their posts to avoid being criticized.
At the same time blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that stimulate collaboration and encourage students to expand their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
Appropriate use of blogs "can make students more sensitive to analytical and reasoning abilities; through positive reactions to material on the Internet, students can identify their role in the context of others' writing as well as present their views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, home to an array of art galleries and museums showcasing historic and modern Canadian artifacts.
Further south is Niagara Falls and north is Muskoka with its unspoiled natural beauty and beyond.
All of this and more makes Ontario stand out as what outsiders see as the quintessential Canadian.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wasteland.
A demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest area and continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller archipelagos are independent countries, or associated with France, and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered by Sahei to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female visitors should state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing rings will also work (only the ones that don't look too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to a situation that they consider harassment and that it is perfectly normal to follow, hold hands, etc.
Say no firmly, and do not be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences do not make wrongs right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and only abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan sales places such as Tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, Shisha and all sorts of trinkets but only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was leveled by the Nyiragongo volcano.
Although Goma remains within safe limits, any visit from outside the city needs to be thoroughly researched to learn about the current fighting situation in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking equipment in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda to visit Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for that short trip.
Given its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its fame attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to encroachment of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World television special on PBS.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which is home to a wildlife ecosystem.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and it is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks Authority (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, conservation activities take place daily and tickets are required to enter the park.
It is also beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, as it can allow you entry into either the parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and it is where many tourists consider the main focal point.
The parade of buildings causes the skyline of Hong Kong to be associated with a sparkling bar graph made clear by the presence of the waters in Victoria Bay.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite bank of the Kowloon River.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists made their claim and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past this is a very good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest belt in the world extending 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
Besides the mangrove swamps, these forests also include some remnants of the majestic forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is wetland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the region.
Buses departing from the inter-district bus station (along the river) run all day, though mainly, especially buses to the East and Jakar/Bumthang will depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most prefectures are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are very comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a convenient and quick form of travel to nearby locations such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.5 meters wide.
Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not until March 2017 that the bridge was opened to traffic.
It is expected that the bridge will be officially operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are completed, as planned.
The Guaraní are the largest indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, with a semi-nomadic hunting and subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region has other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who make their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born after clashes between the conquering Spaniards and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has tried to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the bridge course in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches may also take place here at other times of the year.
For information on the tournament and where to buy tickets, visit the Argentine Polo Association page.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located on Stanley Street opposite FIC West.
Generally, the British pound will be accepted anywhere in the archipelago and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British or American currency may be; check with the host in advance to see which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside these islands, so exchange it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, summer here is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C].
Winters can be cold in a misleading way: temperatures are rarely below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to feel colder than the temperature shown on a thermometer.
There is no distinct "wet" or "dry" season: rainfall throughout the year is almost constant.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild animals and should not be fed or teased.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards [100 m] away from bears and wolves and 25 yards [25 m] from all wildlife!
Despite their gentle appearance, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Dozens of tourists are injured every year because they don't keep a safe distance.
Also, be aware of odors that may attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and maintain hygiene around the camping area.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval armistice in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the period of conflict for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of Tupua leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbours. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) belong to the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches that are safe for swimming and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with many shops along the shore.
The local beer is mainly 'Number One', which is not a mixed beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines you need to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected by being moved.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is also easy to find if you are concerned about this problem.
For Australians the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign. Short black coffee is 'espresso' cappuccino coffee layered over cream (not foaming) and tea served without milk.
Hot chocolate by Belgian standards, expensive but delicious fruit juice.
There are many visits to this reef throughout the year and injuries from this reef are rare.
Still, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all posted signs, and heed all safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of the 1770s, and may occasionally be encountered outside these times.
Sharks are present but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles rarely live in the sea, their main habitat being estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers confidence that they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel agencies are often associated with certain hotels although you can book other forms of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of airfare and hotel.
They can also hold a place for you if you need time to consider a job offer or process other documents related to your destination (e.g. visa).
Despite this, any request or adjustment situation is not sent directly to the hotel but must first be handled through the travel agent.
With some festivals, large numbers of attendees decide to camp on-site and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the area where the action takes place, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the soundstage.
Keep in mind that even though the music on the main stage has been turned off, there are still some areas of the festival that will continue to play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check your sleeping quarters, as icebreakers make an awful noise that not everyone can stand.
Travel time by Saint Petersburg includes time in the city. Passengers on board are visa-free (check conditions).
Casinos often try to maximize their visitors' time and money, often having no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep customers comfortable, and keep them coming back.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers understand the importance of keeping their wits about them.
Anyone who wants to drive on high terrain or ice passes needs to weigh the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on icy roads and low snow cover makes it impossible to drive as you would on a normal asphalt road.
If there is a blizzard, a short period of snowfall is enough to leave you stranded.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the windshield.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and transportation is virtually uninterrupted year-round.
The safari is perhaps the most visited tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to overland travel to view wildlife in Africa, especially the Savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often close to the vehicle and can easily be observed with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be very secretive, so binoculars may be helpful.
A safari trek (also called a "recreational jungle trek", "exploratory mountaineering", or "climbing" trek) consists of hiking up a mountain, for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[1] Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having done so in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may find yourself in a dilemma.
Cancellation policies vary; however, as of the end of March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not allow for an extension to July 2020 - the scheduled time of the Games.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets going for around ¥7,000.
The fact that the clothes are wet can help them dry. Many hotels have a table that is and a dressing table that is for lending, even if you don't see one in the room.
If there is no drying table or if you prefer not to use a dryer, use one if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, may cause a fire).
There are many ways to filter water, some of which are very effective at eliminating specific hazards.
In some places just one minute of boiling is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Visitors may encounter pests they have never seen in their homeland.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases can cause allergies, release toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from value-added taxes and consumption taxes in some locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The long distance between Point Marion and Fairmont makes for the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared for steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limits prescribed in this area are significantly lower than those of the preceding and following sections of road - the common speed falls in the range of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to these regulations is of utmost importance.
The strange thing, of course, is that cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of this route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty and in Bavaria, pastries are quite rich and varied, similar to its neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit cakes are popular here in which apples are used to make cakes all year round, while cherries and plums are also used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste even better with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want something a little sweet, try what the locals call Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of sauce in it.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an incredibly rich and diverse combination of regional cuisines across the country.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the large island of Java.
Now ubiquitous throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine consists of a variety of simple spicy processed dishes, the preferred flavors of which are beans, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a piece of equipment that supports the rider from the saddle to the feet.
They provide greater stability for the rider but there may be safety concerns due to the potential for entrapment of the rider's legs.
If the rider falls but gets their foot stuck in the saddle, they may be dragged away if the horse continues to run.
First, most riders wore high-heeled, smooth-soled boots that were rather narrow.
Next, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled backwards.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing site, known as the Yosemite of South America for its many vertical cliffs and jagged slopes of granite.
The views from the summit are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly blazing new trails between the myriad potential cliffs.
Downhill skiing sports including skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", planning their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing has a long history - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
Downhill skiing has been a sport since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was formed by Norwegians living in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski walking.
It is related to, but generally does not include, alpine skiing; the latter is done in steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trip as similar to a hiking trip.
Under the right conditions, you will cover more distance than you would on foot - but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on your back and on level ground.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Often, passing through many countries means having to apply for a visa and have your passport checked many times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area operates almost as a single country.
As long as you are in this area you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, by possessing a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no specific definition to determine whether a manufactured item is an antique or not.
This definition has variations geographically, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, although their age is much younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is the Sami people's livelihood and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many in other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi engage in large-scale reindeer herding, they live by fishing, hunting and similar activities, and raise reindeer primarily for traction.
Today, many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sapmi, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially in non-Romanian communities, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it evokes associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect conceptions of Romanians.
If the country you will be traveling to becomes a restricted travel destination, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
Views are often presented confusingly, generically, and overly simplistically compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.

A whirlpool is a body of water that flows in the opposite direction from the waves rushing onto the beach, usually at a shallow reef or similar location.
Due to the structure of the underwater terrain, upwelling is concentrated in some deeper areas and fast currents to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are from exhaustion from trying to swim upstream, which is seemingly impossible.
As soon as you get out of the whirlpool, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim in a direction where you will not be swept away by the current, or choose a quiet spot to await rescue, depending on your skill and whether anyone notices your plight.
