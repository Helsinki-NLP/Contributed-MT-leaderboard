This not only confirms the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils don't usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The upper part of the animal's plumage is chestnut, and the underside is pale or peppery, say scientists.
This has given us new insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (called a "plume"), but possessed other feather characteristics (upturned and small feathers), the researchers hypothesized that feathers may have developed later in the evolution of other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the samples suggest that it is the tail of an adult dinosaur, not that of a juvenile.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a juvenile, the samples show adult feathers, not juvenile feathers.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voter is alone during a vote, filling in the candidate of their choice on a pre-printed sheet of paper and placing it in an envelope.
After the staff verifies the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's roll.
The French electoral law has strict rules governing the election process.
Since 1988, the ballot box has been required to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes in the box at the beginning of voting, and that no additional envelopes are put into the box except by duly verified and authorized voters.
Candidates can send delegates to witness every part of the election process. In the evening, volunteers, under strict supervision, count the votes according to a prescribed procedure.

This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but in Scotland, unlike the legal system, the courts considered that the publication of the photographs could amount to bias.
As Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee points out, "It seems to be a very dangerous thing for journalists to publish photos of the suspect, etc".
The UK Crown Prosecution Service, which is handling the prosecution, told reporters it would not comment further until charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document relates to a border dispute in which the Palestinians want to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included: the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both countries, and the Jordan River.
Israel maintained its military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years after the ceasefire agreement was signed, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a five-year military presence.
The shooters will be closely supervised by a ranger, and the trial will be monitored and evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has partnered with the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) to recruit qualified volunteers to participate in the NSW Sport Shooting Association's hunting programs.
According to the National Parks and Wildlife Service's Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Heritage, Mick O'Flynn, the four gunmen selected to carry out the first shooting operations have undergone comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This council is Martelly's response to the massive anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
The protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011, and sometimes turned violent.
About 60 iPods were reported to have malfunctioned due to overheating, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said authorities were aware of 27 incidents involving the device.
METI announced last week that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company considered "not serious".
The ministry said it was "regrettable" that the report was delayed.
The Mariana earthquake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday afternoon).
The Office of Emergency Management for the Northern Mariana Islands said the state had not received any reports of damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer holds a bus full of Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16.
Some of the hostages have been rescued and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and a Filipino photographer were released early.
The photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to use her free time to research premature births.
His research has shown that if you give a hormone, it accelerates fetal lung growth.
China's Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first extreme queen and my first manager. Luna died on a two-moon night, as unique and strong as she was".
"Dustin" "Goldust" Runnels review: "Luna is as geeky as I am... perhaps less so than anything I've ever been... I love her and I'll miss her... hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 respondents interviewed prior to the 2010 federal election, opposition to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election that she thought Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34% of respondents share this opinion and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme end of the spectrum, 29% believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been called into question by his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs for the pain because it's banned by the Olympic committee.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Missouri, discovered the largest mass known to date.
In early February, several people verified this with different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water and organic material on Earth that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists want to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described them as "political rhetoric and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen systems allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the obsolete technology of ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or parking facilities.
The match could be forced to be played behind closed doors without fans due to fears of a lack of transportation.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that it was thought that evolution took much longer, but new species evolved in only two generations due to breeding between the local Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortes) and the exotic cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into different shapes, or it can be bent into small shapes.
It can be pulled into filaments and twisted and knotted. It can also be compressed or rolled into sheets.
Gold can also be made into very thin sheets and coated onto other metals. Sometimes even thinner sheets can be used to decorate the hand-drawn patterns of books, which is called "mud-gilded manuscript".
This is called the acidity of a chemical. You can make an indicator out of celery juice.
Celery juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen ions present in the test chemical.
A lithium ion is the proton after the electron has been removed.
Take two dry powders and knead them into balls with clean hands.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layer of the material, creating a strange sensation and forming a shell-like shape.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house has a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewage treatment system.
Remains of sewage treatment systems have been found in houses from the Minoan civilization in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians and Chinese also had toilets. In the Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths, used by both men and women.
When you're making a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space bounce phone calls back almost instantly.
Satellites are sent into space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our view.
A huge rocket needs to reach more than 100 feet in order to launch a satellite or a telescope.
Wheels have changed the world in remarkable ways.
It's brought us trains and cars and many different kinds of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including pet cats in captivity) feed on a variety of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a good division of labor, where each cat is given a specific job to do so they don't compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and they live in groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three consanguineous adult males plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behaviour of a pride of lions is similar to that of a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, and their behaviour is remarkably similar to that of lions (but different from that of other large cats), and they are very deadly to their prey.
Tigers are omnipotent athletes, able to climb (though not very well), swim, leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars are all members of the rodent family. They are the only four members of the cat family that chew.
The roar of the tiger is different from the loud roar of the lion, but more like the gnashing of teeth.
Bobcats like to eat small animals. They will catch as many rabbits, snakes, rodents and birds as they can. Almost all the animals that bobcats hunt are much smaller than the bobcat.
Scientists think hyenas use their sense of smell to locate where prey has been on the ground to find food.
They have excellent night vision in the dark and can move silently. The way a humpback hunts its prey is to blend into its surroundings and attack it.
When a small population of organisms (a smaller group) separates from the main population from which it was born (e.g. by crossing mountains or rivers, or by migrating to a new island and not easily returning after reaching its destination), it often finds itself in a different environment.
There are different resources and competitors in the new environment, so the new group needs to develop different habits or adaptability to become stronger competitors than before.
Communities haven't changed at all, and they still need the same resilience that they did in the past.
And over time, this new group of people started to adapt to the environment, and they started to become more and more different from each other.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years of baptism, the two groups will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants give off the oxygen we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We use plants to build our houses and make our clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Tyrannosaurs were the top predators of their time, so they were not afraid of anything except other Tyrannosaurs.
Its long jaw is filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set of molars, which means nothing can escape its path.
We're not sure, but it may have a forked tongue. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other crustaceans, and possibly even its own kind.
It attacked everything in the water, even the giants like Tyrannosaurus.
Although much of their food was similar to ours, the Romans also had their own exotic tastes and unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another distinction is that the poor and women sit on chairs, while the rich prefer to eat sideways at banquets.
The food in ancient Rome couldn't possibly have included ingredients that didn't arrive in Europe from the Americas or Asia until centuries later.
For example, the Romans didn't eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa beans, and they didn't roast turkeys.
For every one of their gods the Babylonians built a great temple, which served as the house of the gods.
People would offer sacrifices to the temples, and the priests would try to fulfill the needs of the temples through rituals and festivals.
And in every several house there was an open court to the house of Jehovah; and the inner court was for the priests only.
A pyramidal tower is sometimes built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary of the temple.
And with the warming of the Middle East, housing has become less important.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in their backyards; shops were open counters on the street.
And the price of wood was very high, for there were no forests in the land.
Greenlanders are a rare people. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and discovered the island on his voyage west, naming it Greenland.
Whatever he found, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each of these countries was once "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. There's something written on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence it says, "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". This text is reversed at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large vellum document [293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches] was rolled up and stored at an early date.
So the addition of symbols is probably just a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent campaigns liberated the north of France, but the south of France remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops liberated southern France and then moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together.
The word civilization, derived from the Latin civilis (civil), is related to the Latin civis (citizen) and civitas (city or city-state), which to some extent also define the size of a society.
The city-state is the predecessor of the nation. A civilization culture implies knowledge inheritance over generations, continuity of cultural traces and a certain degree of transmission.
Minority cultures often disappear without any historical evidence and cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
Congress lacked any power to levy taxes. And, as there was no national executive or judiciary, Congress could only rely on state governments, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Nor can Congress overrule taxes or tariffs between states.
Consensus is needed to change laws in states that don't care about the central government and where the representatives are often absent.
The Italy national football team is the joint-second most successful national football team in the world after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, basketball, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians also participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the world's seventh largest island!
Japan is often referred to geographically as the "Archipelago" due to its large number of islands.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to reform indigenous grain production methods and employ Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Weimar. The treaty ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, whose rule over the island did not end until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Tiwanaku, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been reconstructed, giving visitors a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, 35 mm is the most common still image format in the world, and it was the most common size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the image sensor format of later digital cameras followed its length-to-width ratio.
The name of the 35mm format is a bit vague, it is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of length to width (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) of this format is therefore 3/2.
Many common formats (e.g. system formats of advanced photographic systems) also have the same or very different aspect ratios.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple rule of thumb for maintaining order in an image while creating a sense of vividness.
It states that the most efficient position for the subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into equilateral triangles (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church was under intense scrutiny as it grew rich and powerful.
For a thousand years, Christianity kept Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
It affects everyone, from kings to commoners, by its omnipresent power.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that's why church coffers exist.
The centralized authority of the Church of Rome has a thousand-year history and such concentration of power and money that many question the validity of the dogma.
With the start of the war, the British imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violates international law established by international agreements over the past two centuries.
The British position in international waters prevented any vessel from entering the entire ocean area, threatening neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of citizens and the country largely adhered to a pacifist and isolationist position.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a repeat in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with a four-cent deposit, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his manager at his last job, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different periods; each period or ruling family was a unique dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were periods of instability in the divided provinces. The most notable of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In those days, there were fierce wars between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died trying to ascend to the highest throne in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
Many social and political influences followed, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution, all professions were opened to all men to apply, leaving only the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
It's the same in the army, where rank is no longer based on rank, but on ability.
The French Revolution also awakened the oppressed masses of the working class in many other countries to join their revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in things beyond the worldly life. He used to meditate in a cave called Hira on the mountain Noor, which means "light".
The cave has stood the test of time, giving a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Resting on the top of a mountain to the north of Mecca, a cave cut off from the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it's there.
There is only the clear blue sky and the mountains surrounding it. Looking out of the cave, one sees and hears only a small part of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, and is one of many large pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, located in Egypt's Death Valley, is home to pyramids - the largest of which is the Great Pyramid - as well as numerous small mausoleums, temples, and humanoid statues.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The logo for "up arrow" looks like a V, and the logo for "down arrow" looks like a thumbtack or a square missing the bottom.
Up means you should start pushing from the top, down means you should start pulling from the bowstring.
The upstroke generally produces a softer sound, while the downstroke produces a stronger and more realistic sound.
Feel free to write your own logos, but remember that printed bow logos are there for musical reasons, so in general they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children, 11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles, and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from the Palace of Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a group of market women.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd that was shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
A mob suddenly appeared in front of the terrified queen, waving the severed heads of the Royal Guard at Versailles.
The Philippines was conquered by U.S. imperialism, and the cost of the war was borne by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial power, paying most of their expenses and interest on their bonds through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the exorbitant profits generated by the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos will constitute the basic benefits of US imperialism.
Before we can understand the Templars, we have to understand the chronology that led to their founding.
The period in which this occurred is often considered the High Middle Ages in European history, i.e. the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500 BC.
Techno-determinism is a term that encompasses a wide variety of current ideas, ranging from a technological drive or technological imperative to, in the strict sense, the view that human destiny is driven by deeper logic related to the laws of science and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common views: that technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has intrinsic "influences" on society, rather than being socially constrained.
For example, one might say that cars will inevitably lead to more roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible if there are only a few cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars has also led to more road accidents, which has led to medical innovations to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the individual is shaped by the geographical environment, and customs and culture associated with the geographical environment emerge over time. Those cultural customs coordinated with the orientation of society prevail over arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It became famous as a centre of luxury goods from 400 AD until about 1100 AD.
Its position declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders brought back silk, spices, and other wares from their conquests, which were more popular than those offered on the Byzantine market.
From then on, Constantinople lost its status as the fashion capital to Paris.
The Gothic style reached the height of its popularity in the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The design of the original dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But because of the slow communication between east and west, the western style is 25 to 30 years behind the eastern style.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its clothing styles. The most important development came from the Crusades, which introduced the use of buttons to tie clothes.
Sustainable agriculture claims to produce just enough food to feed farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses seeds that are native to an ecoregion and combines rotational tillage or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
A subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by social norms to develop a sense of identity.
The distinctiveness of a subculture can be derived from the age, race, class, geography and/or gender of its members.
What distinguishes a subculture may be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexual orientation, geography, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often express their membership in distinctive and symbolic ways, including clothing, behavior, gestures, and code words.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point out a few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their growth.
Some of these children have been imprisoned, usually by their parents, while others have been abandoned after their parents refused to accept their severe mental or physical disabilities.
The child may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have survived alone in the wild.
When a feral child is raised by a non-human animal, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the animal caring for it, such as feeling fear or indifference towards humans.
While the topic-based approach should make learning easier and more fun, the scaffolding approach takes it a step further.
A scaffold is not a method of learning, but a support that helps people who are experiencing a new learning process, such as using a new computer software or starting a new project.
In other words, a teacher can be a form of a falcon or a Microsoft Office character.
Virtual Falcons are built into the software to ask questions, provoke and explain processes that are difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up without care, love and education, and these children are going through all of that.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and good health care.
Foster care should provide everything that was missing in their previous home.
The Internet has elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet has the obvious characteristic of expanding the scope of use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivations when studying user reactions to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of ephemeral micro-expressions and facial activity.
In particular, it is claimed that accurate interpretation of micro-expressions can detect whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", points out that even someone with brain damage who cannot understand a speech can accurately judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggested that animals such as dogs might have the ability to interpret human behavior as well.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variants and selectively remove existing variants from the gene pool.
Separation and recombination go back and forth between the two sets of genomes in every generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for primates (with digestive systems similar to humans) to obtain the amino acids they need from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant source is protein from leafy or leguminous plants, which are difficult for us primates to digest without cooking.
On the contrary, animal foods (chickpeas, egg whites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein with all the essential amino acids.
So when you think about it, it's not that surprising that our ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the grasslands today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back to sleep within a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, which allows you to be aware but not completely awake.
If you reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other options based on circadian rhythms include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea that is known to cause urination) and waking up to urinate forcefully.
The amount of inner peace one has is inversely related to the amount of physical and mental tension one has.
The less nervous you are, the more positive your expression of life force is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can realize that the only thing that stops us from moving towards that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was popularized through the love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques derived from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to great love.
Kundalini is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting and visualization.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is the Self-Realization Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, purifying the energy channels, opening the chakras, and creating enlightened consciousness.
Cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States was spurred by the common enemy of Germany in World War II. With the end of the war, conflicts between the two countries in institutions, processes and culture led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War officially began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought by proxy armies on real battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defences had been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army, in violation of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invaded Poland's eastern regions, moving into and creating the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.
Shipping is currently the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's traditional role is to make sure that your country can move people and goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples of this is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The United States tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to support the British Empire.
At the same time, the German navy was using U-boats to try to stop shipping.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have conquered England, as it had conquered other European countries before.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes raised them for their milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats are usually raised in herds on mountains or other grazing areas, tended by shepherds who are usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar herding humans. These methods of herding are still in use today.
England had horse-drawn carriages in the 1600s.
Although horse-drawn carriages were only made of parallel planks, they allowed horses to travel faster and to pull heavier loads than the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Piling was introduced early on. Gradually, however, it was found to be more efficient to add a small amount of iron to the surface of the orbit.
This evolved into a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the truck's wooden wheels.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. All-iron track was first introduced in 1767.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking, with the appearance of upright humans two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, didn't walk upright.
Specialized forms of bipedalism have been found in southern ape fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the Chad-Saharan people may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can become activists in some way to reduce the damage in the future.
It's like a symptomatic remedy in many situations. But if we want to go beyond a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it from the root.
Obviously, the world has been completely transformed by the advancement of human technology and technology. The problem has become more acute due to overpopulation and people's excessive luxurious lifestyle.
After Congress passed the bill on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to the John Dunlap Printing House a few blocks away.
It was printed overnight, 150 to 200 copies, and it's now called the Tulip edition.
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon on July 8 in front of the Independence Memorial.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9; a copy was sent to London on August 10.
Twenty-five single-sided Tulip prints are known to still exist and are the oldest surviving versions of the document. The original manuscript is no longer extant.
Now, many paleontologists believe that there were a group of dinosaurs that survived to the present day -- we call them birds.
Because they had feathers and they could fly, many people didn't think they were dinosaurs.
But there's still a lot about birds that's similar to dinosaurs.
They had scales and claws on their feet with which they laid their eggs, and they walked on two hind legs like a dragon.
Almost all computers in use today are built on the manipulation of information, and that information is encoded in binary.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Vomiting and other symptoms are very common and cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The most obvious signs of poisoning in the body may be open medical containers or toxic household chemicals left at the scene.
Read the label of a particular poison to get specific first aid instructions.
The term "worm" as used by entomologists refers to this group of insects.
This vocabulary derives from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, an insect that is perfectly adapted to living among humans.
Assassin worms and bed bugs are nest-dwelling animals that habitually live in their hosts' nests or shelters.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the number one neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might decide that it's not in their best interest or the child's best interest to keep the baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their children.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This is, in fact, the method that guides most scientific research.
Conducting an experiment is not the only method; an experiment is a test to rule out one or more viable hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations can also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers valued the classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are widely accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the Western world became divorced from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral processes are often largely determined by the presence or absence of endogenous cycles and their functioning via the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms are not only a response to external periodic cues, but are also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is self-sustaining and will continue to oscillate freely without external cues for a period of time.
The experiment of Hirsch and Jones is one of the important proposals of the idea that DNA is the genetic material.
Hirsch and Jones used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, one labeled the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive iodine, and the other labeled the proteins in the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether or not the affected cell is a germline cell, the mutation can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in cells of the genome are passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is an attraction for nature lovers to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, visiting parks and studying ecosystem data.
One example of this is to visit, photograph and meet the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from their villages and towns to their workplaces and they pass people who are going to the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected and supports the transportation system to some extent with their private cars.
Today's science says that this large carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of the steady states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation.
You rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges in the developed world.
Why is it that our transportation system causes so many complaints, why does it break down every day, are the transportation engineers so incompetent, or is it something much more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of individual drivers and vehicles moving between two points and interacting with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is not easy because we cannot predict the behavior of drivers with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to be reasonably stable; therefore, traffic flow tends to be reasonably consistent and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, the relationship between three main characteristics is established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
This allows them to move to smaller areas to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a guy named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people think he's right, but many people think the opposite is true, that the solar system moves around the Earth.
It makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the world's second longest and largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers to the oceans on the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main channel of the Amazon is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Construction of the pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the scale and engineering prowess of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments that were over a thousand years old from the previous period.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest sovereign state in the world in both area and population.
The legal and official language of Vatican City is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working in the country, while Latin is more commonly used in religious services.
All citizens in Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since ancient times, because they can be mined in nature in prototype and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things were composed of one or more mixtures of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four forms of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. But his theory also states that different forms of these elements can be converted into new matter, forming what we see before our eyes.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as hydrogen and helium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that the period at the end of this sentence has trillions of atoms in it.
So when the pencil first came out, a lot of people saw it as a friend.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer ways of writing, the status and frequency of the pencil has declined.
People are typing on computer screens, no longer needing a pencil.
One can only wonder what happens to keyboards when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works because it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Kind of like pushing a heavy wheelbarrow up a hill -- splitting the nucleus again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no vibration.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the front and 100 kilometers thick on the back.
The crust beneath the lunar sea is thinner; the crust above it is thicker.
Because of the thinner crust, there may be more lunar ocean in front, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out why people do things or what interests them.
These theories propose that people internalize certain needs and/or desires as they grow into adults.
These theories explore what it is about people that makes them want to do certain things and what it is about their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two widely known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager starts to lead former colleagues, there are two types of behaviors you might see.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning work, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the manager becomes a completely different person, who thinks he or she has to change everything that is constant in the team and take full responsibility for it.
After all, a leader must ultimately take responsibility for his team's success or failure.
This behavior sometimes causes friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there is a slight difference.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their physical team.
Because their teams can meet in different time zones and local managers may not understand, they tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members.
Larson and Rafasto (1989, p. 109) have shown that the existence of a real "invisible team" is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which everyone reports. The invisible team sets the standards for everyone.
One of the goals of implementing organizational learning is to innovate.
When all available resources are fully utilized by functional departments within an organization, creativity and originality flourish.
And finally, collaborative processes within the organization to overcome the bottlenecks can lead to innovative processes to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must build a culture of innovation and promote knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Ando (2006) explains that the continuum method is a method used to help organizations improve performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive research, thus narrowing its scope and making it more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior has been validated by scientific research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to some changes in mental function.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and a lot of material to build a simulation to help us understand how the brain works.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it still constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptability.
Research into artificial intelligence involves automating tasks that machines will need to perform intelligently.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and recognize handwriting, voice and facial expressions.
Each of these has now become a separate field, focusing on providing solutions to problems encountered in real life.
AI systems are commonly used in business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been built into software applications for some home computers and video games.
Fieldwork is an important part of all teaching. Teachers often want to take students to places where the bus cannot reach.
Technology provides virtual field trips where students can visit museums, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual field trips are also a great way to reflect on and share experiences of field trips in future teaching and learning.
For example, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design an annual website about their trip to the state capitol, which is updated annually, but older versions are kept online as a keepsake.
Blogging also improves students' writing skills. When students start blogging, they often have serious grammar and spelling mistakes, and the presence of readers can generally change this.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers will start working hard to improve their writing so as not to be criticized.
In addition, the journal "promotes students' understanding of their surroundings". Satisfying the needs of readers' interests inspires students to become smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
It's a tool that inspires collaboration outside of school and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of journals "enhances students' analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their own position in terms of the semantics of other people's articles and outline their views on particular issues" (Olachenko, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, featuring an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls to the south, and the Muscogee River to the north.
All of this makes Ontario stand out and be seen as quintessentially Canadian.
Much of the north is sparsely populated, and some of it is uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a surprising demographic contrast for many people: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent and home to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
Islam was brought to the land by the Arabs and led to major conquests in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Advice to any female traveler, regardless of marital status, is to say that you are married.
Bringing a ring would also help (just don't make it look too expensive).
Women should be aware that there are cultural differences that can lead to acts that could be considered harassment, such as being followed from behind or holding someone's arm.
Be firm when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to speak your mind.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-Badiya, and Spanish merchants established a trading post there and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as Taj pots, ceramics, leatherware, water pipes and all kinds of gadgets, but all are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially in the town centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, anyone visiting outside of Goma should do research to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also home to Mount Nyiragongo and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking service in Africa.
You can get around Goma in a Mototaxi. A short ride normally costs about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for far-away exoticism.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its history has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to desertification.
Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the World in Africa included it as one of the main stops.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country as it is more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Salmon River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is considered the flagship park of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there is a daily maintenance fee and an entrance fee.
There are also benefits if you buy a wildlife card, which gives you access to designated South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is a focal point for many tourists.
The many skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong's skyline appear as a shimmering bar graph against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to Kowloon Beach on the other side of the coast.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land on the northern shore.
It's a great place to start looking for colonial history in the region.
The Sudakban is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
Sunderbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest located in India is known as the Sunderbans National Park.
However, the forests here are more than just mangrove swamps, they also include the last of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plains.
The area of Sudan is 3,850 km2, of which about a third is water/marshland.
Since 1966, it has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Pygmy deer in the region.
There are buses from the regional bus station (across the river) all day, but most of them are concentrated between 06:30 and 07:30 (especially to the east and to Punakha / Bumthang).
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most of the area is served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Ridesharing is a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 kms) and Pune (200 kms).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil to the city of Saint-Georges-d'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The height of the twin towers is 83 meters, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, with two lanes of 3.50 meters.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters high. It was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 with the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guaran√≠ lived in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco is home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who make their living from hunting, gathering food and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Indian Giants", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.
Since its founding in Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest championship of the year takes place in Las Ca√±itas in December.
At other times of the year, smaller championships and competitions are held.
For information on the tournament and where to buy tickets, visit the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set equal to one pound sterling (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located opposite Stanley's FIC West store.
You can use British pounds everywhere on the island, but credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are generally not accepted outside the island, but may be accepted in British and American currency; please confirm acceptable payment methods with the owner beforehand.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change money before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; it is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winter can be mistaken for cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but with wind and humidity, it can feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no difference between the rainy season and the dry season: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, a distance of at least 100 yards must be kept from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards from other wildlife!
Bisons, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal have the potential to attack, no matter how tame they may seem.
Dozens of tourists are injured every year for not keeping a proper distance from the animals.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears or other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong smelling food, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lerofi III.
Since Auckland straddles two harbours, there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches (North Harbour area) are located in the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of the beaches are suitable for swimming, and most are planted with New Zealand Christmas trees to provide shade.
Tamaki Road Beach in the Waitemata Harbour is located in the central Auckland suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
It is popular with family swimmers, sometimes crowded, and there are many shops along the coast.
The main local beer is No.1. Not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is Manta.
You can get a lot of French wine here, but New Zealand and Australia probably have better shipping.
The local tap water is safe to drink. However, it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For Australians, "white coffee" is a foreign concept. "Short black coffee" is "Italian coffee concentrate", "bubbly coffee" is "highly objectionable" (not "bubbly"), and "tea" is "no milk".
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. The juice is expensive, but the quality is good.
Many people travel to reefs throughout the year. Injuries from any of these causes are rare on reefs.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April 1770, box jellyfish frequented beaches and estuaries. Outside this period, they were occasionally found.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will move away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live primarily in the ocean. Their primary habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually have a partnership with a particular hotel, but you can also book other types of accommodation such as campsites through travel agencies.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even a combination of flights and hotels.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents at your destination (e.g. a visa), they can also hold the reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should be made through the travel agency, not directly with the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the people attending the festival choose to camp on site, and they consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early and find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stage may have ended, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some music festivals have special campsites for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because when crossing the ice, the most affected cabin will have a terrible noise.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers may be exempt from visa requirements (see terms for details).
Casinos usually try to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend. They often have no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep people in a good mood and stay in the casino.
Free alcoholic beverages are available at some venues. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes at high altitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On cold and snowy roads, there is less friction and you cannot drive as well as on ordinary asphalt roads.
During a snowstorm, a very short snowfall is enough to trap you.
Visibility may be limited by snow or ice on the windshield.
On the other hand, freezing and snowing conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Hunting tourism is perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and the most anticipated trip for many travelers.
The term "hunting trip" generally refers to a trip by land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the tropical grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to be close to cars, and using standard equipment will give you a clear view.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy, so it's easier to see them with binoculars.
A hunting trip (also known as a "jungle walk", "hunting excursion" or "walk") consists of an excursion lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the last being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus did not include July 2020 (i.e. when the Olympics were originally scheduled to take place).
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from ¬•2,500 to ¬•130,000, with a typical ticket price around ¬•7,000.
Washing clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards even if there are no rooms available.
If there is no iron, or you don't like wearing wrinkled socks, then you can try it if there is a wind chime.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases burn).
There are many different ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other places it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, so if you are concerned, consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests that are uncommon in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread toxins or spread infections.
Infectious diseases per se, or dangerous animals that are capable of harming or killing people by force, generally do not meet the criteria for being pests.
Duty-free shopping is the practice of purchasing duty-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers in countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Marion Point and Fairmont presents some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often traversing remote and rugged terrain.
Be careful if you are not used to driving on country roads: there are mainly steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp bends.
The legal speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the speed is more important than anything else.
But strangely, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than many other places along the way, like the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are delicious, while Bavarian pastries are similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria, and very diverse.
Fruit cakes are common, with cakes made with apples available year-round, while cherries and blueberries are summer favorites.
Almonds, oranges and other nuts are added to many German dishes. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee are often a perfect accompaniment.
If you want to try some small delicious pastries, you can try the Berliner Fruchtkuchen, which may also be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "salty", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common ingredient in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a wide variety of local dishes from all over the country.
However, without further modification, the term tends to be interpreted as food originating from central and eastern main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is ubiquitous throughout the archipelago and consists of a range of dishes that are simple to prepare, with the main spices preferred by Javanese people being peanuts, salt, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is a support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but also pose a safety risk as the rider's foot may get stuck inside.
If the rider is thrown from the horse, but there is a foot peg on the saddle, and the horse runs away, they may be dragged. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders' boots have heels and smooth and rather narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with a safety harness, so that the rider can pull back when falling, and the leather of the saddle will fall off the saddle.
One of Chile's top climbing sites, Cochamo Valley, also known as the Valley of the Champions of South America, has distinctive large granite walls and cliffs.
The view from the summit is breathtaking. Hikers from all over the world continue to develop new routes along the endless stone walls of the valley.
Downhill skiing (including skiing and snowboarding) is a popular sport in which skis or snowboards are strapped to the feet and used to glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity and there are many enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as "ski nuts") who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians organized the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski tourism or ski touring.
Although associated with alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, most do not involve it. The latter takes place on steep slopes and requires more rigid skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can ski farther than you can walk, but in rare cases, you can have the speed of cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a smooth track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. In general, traveling to multiple countries means having to apply for multiple visas and pass multiple passport checks.
But Shenzhen operates like a country.
You usually have to go through passport control when crossing the border as long as you are in the Shenzhen area.
Again, as long as you have a Shenzhen visa, you can save time, money and paperwork by not having to apply for a visa in every Shenzhen member country.
There is no uniform definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define an antique as an item that is more than 100 years old.
This definition varies geographically, and the antique age limit in North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques even though they are younger than their mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture of reindeer trade is important for many other occupations.
Traditionally, not all Sami have engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather rely on fishing, hunting and similar activities. Reindeer are mainly used as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people engage in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sami people in the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used (especially by non-Roma), it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for a country you are visiting, your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
In addition to the recommendations of the government of your own country, you can also consult the recommendations of other governments, but they are often aimed at their citizens.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The advice presented here is a bit more generic and simplistic than the more detailed information elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, which may depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risks that may affect the bad weather in their area, as they may affect any tour plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that is considered a war zone needs to undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "environmental education" will provide the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all of the topics discussed here, is analyzed in detail, and often has hands-on experience.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are very common, but very few about war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documentation for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify a gender (X) or to renew them to conform to the required name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to abide by these documents varies widely.

Transgender people prior to surgery should not have an expectation of privacy and dignity as they go through the scanner.
An offshore current is a wave that washes ashore on a beach, usually at a reef or similar location.
Since the underwater topographic gyres are concentrated in some deeper part, the fast currents towards deep water may be derived from this.
Most of the deaths are from exhaustion from trying to swim against the tide, which is unlikely to succeed.
Once you're out of the flow, it's just as easy to swim back.
When you still haven't been found, try to aim somewhere else, but it also depends on what you can do and if you've been noticed, because you might want to wait for rescue.
The return-to-work shock comes more quickly than the culture shock, lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who used to easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding because they know that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
What people may not realize is that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
For children, the Pyramid Light Show is one of the most entertaining activities in the region.
You can visit the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
On the pyramids, different pyramids are lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are currently claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with 16 in operation as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, home to the town of Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still-active volcanic crater was flooded to create a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located in the southern part of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bering Strait.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains emerge and are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, at 4,892 metres (15,710 ft) at the summit of Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are not a replacement for mobile phones in general, because you have to be outdoors and unobstructed from the satellite to make a call.
This type of service is often used for shipping, including yachts, and expeditions with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
Travel and study are an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can actually increase your chances of returning to your home country for higher education.
In general, you have to pay tuition fees to attend these programs.
Finland is ideal for canoeing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal islands.
Yachts don't have to go around islands and lakes.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, small boats and even rowing boats offer a different experience.
Rowing is a very popular pastime among Finns, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
There are similar cases in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but Finland is unique among other countries (in the Netherlands, for example, the number is 1 in 40).
Most of the unique Baltic Sea cruises are spent in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you have two full days to visit the historic city and return to the boat to sleep at night.
As of 2009, you don't need a visa if you're just coming ashore by boat.
Some cruise ships are featured in brochures as Berlin, Germany. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and the cost of visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

Courier companies are well rewarded for delivering items quickly. Time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but on other routes, the smaller companies have problems.
If they transport cargo by air, on some routes it may take days to unload and clear customs.
The fastest way is to send it out as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit carrying luggage without a passenger, and that's where you want to be.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a lot of money for that privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: based on rough experience, you can expect business class to probably cost four times as much as regular economy and first class 11 times as much!
In general, it doesn't make sense to try to find a good deal on business or first class seats on a direct flight from point A to point B.
Because airlines know full well that some core-carrier passengers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the emergence of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.

Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested with beech, spruce and fir trees, with a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Because it has a range of microclimates, different soils and different elevations, there is obviously an exceptional diversity of plant communities.

Rare populations can be found here, such as the brown bear, wolves, falcons, owls, bobcats, wildcats, and squirrels, as well as many endemic species.
When visiting monasteries, women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for unprepared ladies, but if you have a scarf, especially a brightly colored one, the monk or nun who enters will smile at you.

These can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing them.

However, people who know only a little Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese, which is very similar, does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually abandoned and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as severe in their heyday as it is today, they were usually located in cities or on university campuses, more easily accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are large facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Flower viewing, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where people choose to admire plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party was held near the Imperial Palace by the Emperor for himself and other members of the Imperial family.
Plants grow beautifully in their natural habitat, so you need to resist the temptation to pick only a few good specimens.
A visit to a carefully landscaped garden to collect "specimens" is certainly out of the question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, and it's very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But Singapore is a few degrees north of the equator in the subtropics, so you're used to hot weather and fierce sun.

There's a tradition of waking up to watch the sunrise at some point on Easter night.
Christian theology can explain the origins of this tradition, but it most likely refers to a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.

All the animals that originally came to the island did so by swimming, flying or floating.
The remoteness of the archipelago from the mainland prevents mammals from travelling great distances, making giant tortoises the primary grazers in the Galapagos.
Since humans came to the Galapagos Islands, they brought with them many mammals, including goats, horses, cattle, mice, cats and dogs.
If you visit the North Pole or the South Pole in the winter, you will experience polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a great opportunity to see the aurora because the sky will be completely dark for 24 hours.
And because these areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is usually not a problem, and you can see the stars.
Japanese workplace culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or titles.
