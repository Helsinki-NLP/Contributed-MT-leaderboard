Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William Moran said that even as the U.S. Navy is revitalizing itself to deal with an increasingly worrisome Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the U.S. continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region - which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific - as a naval priority.
According to a September 24 report on the Weibo website of the British defense weekly Wei Jane, the United States has listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in its new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has revived the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activities.
These moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear the U.S. Navy may be moving away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran says the US Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a roundtable discussion on "Addressing the Challenges of the High Seas" hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington, D.C., he said: "For us, nothing has changed significantly".
"The point is still rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity, or whatever you want to call it", Moran said.
However, he admits that the US has close ties with Europe.
He said: "We will continue to look at the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do".
While pointing out that overall policy on Russia falls under the purview of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Moran warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history shows that if we come into conflict with them, they will be very tough".
The U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying forces into a "new mode of operation" as part of the U.S. resumption of operations against Russia, China and other competitors, which will help keep adversaries off-guard as to where U.S. carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place, General Moran said.
He said: "We in the Navy and Marines support it - the concept of unpredictability of operations, not showing up in the same place over and over again, almost like a command post - that's what we do".
One of the first to try this new approach was the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group, whose early deployments included working visits to ports and patrols in areas normally only passed through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure allies know that the ships will still be patrolling in traditional areas and is also addressing logistics and home liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian military can work seamlessly with the US carrier battle group.
This will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to acquire nine more Aegis-equipped frigates, he said.
Several airlines raised or reinstated fuel surcharges on October 5th, which will increase the cost of flights starting next Friday
Yesterday, Xiangyang Airlines, Okai Airlines and other airlines announced that starting from October 5, 2018, fuel surcharge for domestic routes will be charged 20 yuan per passenger for routes below 800 kilometers and 30 yuan per passenger for routes above 800 kilometers.
Airlines such as Qianxiang Airlines and Okai Airlines announced that starting from October 5, 2018, the fuel surcharge for domestic flights below 800 kilometers (included) will be increased from 10 yuan per person to 20 yuan per person, and the fuel surcharge for domestic flights above 800 kilometers will be increased from 10 yuan per person to 30 yuan per person.
Children, military and police disabled are 10 yuan per person; babies continue to be exempt.
According to the person in charge of the Ctrip ticket, the airline has indicated in the notification that the fuel surcharge will be charged on the date of the original ticket, and the fuel surcharge will not be refunded when the ticket is changed.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued before October 5 do not have to pay fuel surcharge according to the new standard if you want to change to October 5 (inclusive).
Since June 5, 2018, a number of airlines such as Air China, Air China, Air China, HNA, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines, and Okai Airlines have resumed charging the fuel surcharge for domestic routes, which has been canceled for 3 years.
This time, Xiangyang Airlines and Okai Airlines were the first to announce an increase in fuel surcharge, but as of press time, the four major domestic airlines have not announced follow-up adjustments.
It is also understood that the Civil Aviation Authority of Hong Kong stipulates that airlines can decide for themselves whether to charge a fuel surcharge from November onwards.
On September 27, Cathay announced that it would resume charging the fuel surcharge on November 2.
All tickets issued or reissued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon on or after November 2 will include a fuel surcharge of 652 yuan for long-haul flights to Hong Kong and the Southwest Pacific region, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, and 146 yuan for short-haul flights, according to the airline's website.
The fee applies to all types of tickets and is calculated per flight segment and includes all direct sales channels in Thailand.

Japan's Itochu Commercial Bank on Friday wrote down $1.3 billion in impairment losses on its investment in China's CITIC shares, its largest corporate investment deal, as it was affected by trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked past the headquarters of Matsushita Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said the trade war has hit its U.S. grain division, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of the Sino-US trade friction in their latest results, and now these Japanese trade chambers have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, and US President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the scope of tariffs to all Chinese goods worth more than $500 billion if the dispute cannot be resolved.
According to Tsuyoshi Hachimura, CFO of Itochu, the trade dispute could have a bigger impact on the Chinese economy next year.
Itochu Commerce and the Thai Rapeseed Group invested US$10 billion in ZTE in 2015 and acquired a 20% stake.
According to Hachimura, Itochu reported a loss of 143.3 billion yen (US$1.3 billion) for this stake, as it believes that the stock price will not recover in the near future.
Itochu Business maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25 percent import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July in response to Washington's moves in the trade dispute.
"Our grain business has been hit by the US-China trade friction", said Marubeni's finance minister, Yayoi Yamaguchi.
He said that since September, he has stopped financial transactions from his own account.
In a statement Friday, Qualcomm spokesman Pat Burke said the move was "in line with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunities".
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to job losses.
Marubeni maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen, helped by pulp and paper and power generation business.
Sumitomo Commerce on Thursday announced a 16% increase in profits between April and September, highlighting "the uncertain outlook caused by the US trade issues with China".
On Friday, Mitsubishi Commercial Bank raised its annual profit forecast to a record high, due to increased coking coal production and higher commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi also announced new business plans aimed at boosting profits to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, from an estimated 640 billion yen this year.
The countdown to the US midterm elections has begun.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively solicited votes from their core voters.
Both parties pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the election.
In the 48 hours leading up to the US election, Trump was reportedly busy attending Republican candidate rallies, while former president Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand up for Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly and shout his final plea to the crowd before the election.
On November 4, Trump stood on a stage in Macon, Georgia for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp and said, "You have to go to the polls on Tuesday, you have to vote".
"The contrast in this election could not be clearer".
Political enthusiasm among voters is at an unprecedented high, with early voting in some states far exceeding the norm.
When a sitting U.S. president faces his first midterm election, the congressional seats of his party tend to shrink.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday, while the Democrats still have the upper hand in the U.S. House of Representatives race, Republicans could benefit from Trump's economic assessment and strict focus on border security.
Polls show that registered voters prefer the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives over the Republican candidate by a margin of 50 percent to 43 percent, still down from a 14-point lead in August.
A separate poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed the Democrats still leading the Republicans by 7 percentage points.
Obama reportedly told the crowd at Senator Donnelly's rally: "When people don't tell the truth, when words don't mean anything anymore, there are consequences".
"Democracy doesn't work when all you can do is lie".
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your vote".
Democrats face their toughest Senate race in decades, with Republicans holding more than half of the chamber's 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, with the Democrats needing to win 23 more seats to take control of the 435-seat chamber.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a prediction website, estimate that the Democrats have an 85% chance of winning the House.

BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- Under the current wave of mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation, more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents and occupying market dominance.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered a wave of infringement in patent technology licensing, patent technology use, and so on.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, Zhao Wei, He Zhaohui, and Lei Lei, sued the developer of the "Drip Travel" APP, Beijing Xiaopeng Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaopeng Technology Co., Ltd.), the operator, and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific), to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs request the court to order the three defendants to immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Arbitration Network published the Civil Award for the First Instance of the Invention Patent Infringement Dispute Between Liu Wei, He Zhaoguang and Others and Beijing Xiaoyuan Technology Co., Ltd., and disclosed details of some of the cases in which DiDi Travel APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patent owner and inventor of the "mobile terminal-based ridesharing service system and method" patent, and the entire operation process of the "smooth ride" application in the "Didi Travel" APP correspond to the technical scheme of the patent protection in question, constitutes patent infringement.
However, during the period of the court ruling, Xiaoyuan Technology believes that Guangdong Pacific is not a suitable defendant, it only provides free download of the APP "Didi Travel" on the Internet, does not implement the patent method involved, there is no direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Second, the infringement was not committed in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the place of infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question is fully implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court is objected to and the case is transferred to the court where the defendant resides, that is, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the allegedly infringing Didi Travel APP product on its web platform, and the plaintiff listed the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
The defendant Guangdong Pacifico is domiciled in Guangzhou and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Xiaoyuan Technology, argued that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial on insufficient grounds, rejected the defendant, Xiaoyuan Technology Co., Ltd.'s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and assumed the costs of the jurisdiction objection case.
At present, the other proceedings of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the Didi travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO): Australia-China cooperation in science and technology is remarkable
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly in the past few decades, and the two countries can achieve fruitful results by working together in the field of science".
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), said in an interview with Xinhua in Beijing that cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology is booming, from tackling climate change to the Sky Eye project.
As the largest national research agency in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world-renowned innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's an enduring friendship that includes a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation", Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope, China's Tianhe, installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is the most advanced 19-beam receiver in the world, jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on years of technology accumulation by CSIRO.
"This is one of the strengths of CSIRO's contribution to FAST".
In addition to these collaborations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese research institutions on the construction of the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"Scientific research in the past has often focused on the problems of a hundred years from now, and now we need more scientific research to solve the problems ahead".
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather events are occurring more frequently around the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the population explosion, aging and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"Cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has mainly focused on resolving these current difficulties".
Marshall said the International Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Centre, built by CSIRO with the National Laboratory of Ocean Science and Technology in Qingdao, focuses on observing El Niño and La Niña, studying their relationship with extreme weather, and establishing extreme weather warning facilities.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to do alone, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today".
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation, which for us is mainly in science and technology".
For example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold refining method that does not use cyanide. Many countries are hoping to find a gold refining method that is less polluting to the environment because the traditional cyanide gold refining method is very harmful to the environment.
"We are willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the achievements of our participation in the Belt and Road cooperation".
On the 29th, the 2018 Baoding Silk Road Tourism Promotion Cooking Project Cooperation Meeting was held in Urumqi City, Xinjiang. While enjoying the development achievements of Baoding, the guests also enjoyed the local cuisine and felt the local rich historical culture.
In the month prior to the event, Baoji has carried out a series of tourism promotion activities in eight cities along the Silk Road, including Tianhui, Pingxiang, Lanzhou, Jinchuan, Guiyuan, Xining, Zhangjiagang, and Hami.
Hu Jintao, Mayor of Baoding City, Shaanxi Province, introduced that Baoding has a long history and culture, a strong industrial base, is the second largest city in Shaanxi Province and the second center city of the Guantian Economic Zone and the Guanzhong Plain urban cluster, an important node city along the Belt and Road Initiative.
In recent years, Baoding City has continued to promote the five major functions of industrial cluster, logistics hub, comprehensive service, open highlands, and humanistic cohesion, accelerating the pursuit of superior and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Commissioner for Tourism Development of Baoding City and the Urumqi Tourism Bureau signed a strategic tourism cooperation agreement.

Chen Hongwei, head of the Baoding City Tourism and Development Commission, said: "Some tourism resources in Xinjiang and the United States are complementary to Baoding, and we have been promoting tourism to Xinjiang along the way, mainly introducing Baoding's cultural heritage, cuisine, and natural scenery.
The event focused on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc. through the broadcast of tourism publicity films, promotion of cultural tourism resources and projects, organizing tourism photography exhibitions, producing publicity exhibition editions, distributing publicity materials, and docking tourism cooperation exchanges.
"At this event, all departments at all levels, county districts, and development zones of Baoding City actively coordinated and implemented a large number of good and big projects.
So far, a total of 41 projects have been signed, involving a total amount of 260.43 billion yuan.
In recent years, Baotou has continued to promote the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, comprehensive services, open heights, and humanistic clusters around the goals of building an international city, a famous city of equipment manufacturing, a famous city of history and culture, and a beautiful and happy city with livable properties along the Belt and Road Initiative.
In 2017, the GDP of the region reached 218 billion yuan, an increase of 8.7%.
It has been awarded more than 20 national honors such as the National Civilized City, the National Ecological Park City and the Chinese People's Environmental Award.
Urumqi Municipal Committee Standing Committee Member and Deputy Mayor Zhao Naimin introduced that Urumqi, as a major town on the New Northern Road on the Silk Road, has special geographical location advantages, has long been an important passageway connecting Tian Shan north and south, communicating Xinjiang with the mainland, China and Central Asia, Western Asia and Europe.

The revitalization of the Northeast is related to the overall development of the country.
Industrial enterprises in the northeast are more important and have a good foundation.
The question of whether the dynamism of the old industrial base can be re-energized and unleashed stirs the Secretary-General's heart.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States and that it is impossible for North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Lee told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "very friendly steps" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot unilaterally give up our weapons first".
Although Lee is repeating North Korea's complaint that the United States opposes "phased" denuclearization, his speech is significant because it does not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Lee referred to the June 12 joint statement between Kim and Trump, when Kim agreed to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue an 'end-of-war declaration,'" Li said.
"The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees begging for mercy is a daydream of people who don't understand us".
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust".
Lee made no mention of the US president's plan for a second summit at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted Kim's three meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, saying: "If the other party to denuclearization was South Korea and not North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have become so halting".
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 items from November 1, 2018.
This year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the tax on pharmaceuticals will be completely reduced, and import tariffs on all common drugs, including anti-cancer drugs and biological anti-cancer drugs, and imported Chinese medicines will be adjusted to zero.
At the same time, the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been significantly reduced.
On July 1, taxes on 218 types of vehicles and parts were reduced.
After the tax reduction, China's car tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, in line with the reality of China's automobile industry.
The tax reduction will promote the restructuring of the industry and the optimization of resource allocation, accelerate the process of winning and losing, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers get more benefits.
On July 1, taxes on 1,449 items of daily consumption were reduced.
Tax cuts for daily consumer goods are closely related to the people's need for a better life.
This tax cut is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Reducing taxes on daily consumer goods will directly benefit consumers and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, taxes will be reduced on 1,585 taxable industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials.
Appropriately reducing import tariffs on some industrial products that are in high demand at home can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing domestic effective supply and promoting industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources globally and reduce production costs.
According to the relevant person in charge of the office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of China, the above four voluntary tariff reductions, as well as the third round of tariff reductions implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the outcome of the negotiations on expanding the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% last year to 7.5%.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and at a moderately low level, which is basically in line with China's developing country status and development stage.
As one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of trade in goods, the total level of tariffs should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world, and it has the economic foundation to further expand opening up, but the quality and effectiveness of trade development are still lagging behind those of developed economies.
Tariffs are a means of protecting compliance, and the level of tariffs should be commensurate with the competitiveness of the industry.
Customs duty rates should be adjusted to meet both production and consumption needs.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that is conducive to the transformation and upgrading of domestic demand, and strive to increase the import of products with characteristic advantages that are more concentrated in the needs of the people, and continuously enhance the sense of access of enterprises and the public to meet the needs of upgrading industrial structure and consumption structure.
Tax cuts should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenues and industrial development.
In the selection of specific tax reduction goods and the extent of tax reduction, it is necessary to coordinate the two markets at home and abroad, the two upstream and downstream aspects, and the two relations between production and consumption, so as to maintain the steady and steady development momentum of China's economy.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and China's initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is a major measure taken in accordance with China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to coordinating the use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system, and meeting the needs of the people.
These actions and initiatives show that China will firmly pursue an opening-up strategy that is mutually beneficial and win-win, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world.
Serbia declares highest state of readiness Serbian President to meet tomorrow to discuss Kosovo situation
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has ordered the country's armed forces to go on high alert in view of the fact that Kosovo Special Forces have seized access to the reservoir of the Gazivode hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by Belgrade.
On 29 September, Serbian Minister of Defence Vulin announced that the Serbian Armed Forces had entered a state of full combat readiness.
Vulin stressed that Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders remain in force and that the Serbian army will respond regardless of how the situation develops.
According to Russia's Tass news agency, Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had informed the US, Russia and Europe of the current situation and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek his support on Kosovo.
Asked whether Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Vucic answered in the negative: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory".
Vucic also said that the Serbian army's move to full combat readiness is only a deterrent to prevent a conflict, but it is also a clear warning that any violence in Kosovo will not be tolerated.
The Serbian army's increased readiness is related to two major moves in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, ethnic Albanians in the northern part of Kosovo have been arresting ethnic Serbs who have lived there for generations.
Vucic said that since the head of the Serbian government's office for Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Jurić, was beaten and detained by Kosovo Albanians on March 26 this year, Albanians have escalated the situation in the region and carried out inhuman arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 members of the self-proclaimed ROSU special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, including armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the reservoir of the Gazivode hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports center near the northern embankment of the Kosovo region and blocked all roads nearby.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out under the auspices of Western countries and that the Kosovo army's actions were not notified to the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter IX, Paragraph 1 of the Brussels Agreement, as well as in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic has called out NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for the hypocrisy of Western statements on Kosovo.
The roots of the current conflict lie in centuries-old historical grievances between the Serb and Croat communities in Kosovo.
Serbs and Albanians have different opinions about Kosovo.
Serbia considers Kosovo to be the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, as Serbs established their most powerful state here in the 12th century, while ethnic Albanians only migrated in large numbers after the Ottoman invasion and the Serbian defeat in the north.
The Albanians insist that the Illyrians, the original tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th centuries BC, are the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to fierce conflicts between different ethnic, religious and cultural groups, resulting in a fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, ethnic Kosovars were the first to declare Albania's independence.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased. In the eyes of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" was seen by the Albanians as the plunder of "Greater Serbianism".
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and Serbian troops and police led to NATO bombing of the Southern Alliance of Serbia and Montenegro.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Despite the news that Serbia would normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, the agreement could not be signed due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
Just a month ago, Vucic for the first time explicitly advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, once again making the conflict between the two ethnic groups public.
Power and communication still cut off as tsunami relief efforts in Indonesia hit by massive earthquake
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency on the morning of the 30th, a strong earthquake and tsunami that occurred on the 28th in Tonggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, have killed 420 people.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of Indonesia's disaster agency, said the figure was only preliminary in Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the epicenter.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge in Bali, Indonesia, damaged by the earthquake and tsunami, collapsed and broke into several pieces.
Due to the extensive damage to electricity and communication facilities, the earthquake's epicenter in Songkhla county and the neighboring Siji district are still "islands" that cannot be contacted, and it is impossible to count the number of victims.
Meanwhile, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could be in the thousands.
Power cuts, communications blackouts, roads blocked, airports damaged... ...rescue efforts after the massive earthquake and tsunami have been difficult.
Some hospitals and relief sites in Palu rely on fuel to power themselves due to power outages.
Roads in and out of the city have been blocked by landslides, making fuel supplies tight for large transport vehicles, including tankers.
Indonesian Minister of Social Affairs Agus said the ministry's emergency relief supplies of tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household items from neighboring South Sulawesi and Colombo provinces have not yet arrived in the affected areas due to road damage.
Relief supplies from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by Air Force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the Palu airport command tower and runway in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and security of rescue, and only military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel have been allowed to land.
Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Wiranto, who is leading the relief effort in the quake zone, called for the restoration of electricity and commercial flights to the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of aid agencies such as hospitals and allow more rescue workers and volunteers and aid supplies to reach the affected areas.
A series of strong earthquakes occurred in Tonggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on the 28th. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time triggered a tsunami, causing major disasters in Palu City, Tonggara County and Sigi.
BEIJING, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, which has attracted thousands of Beijing residents on social platforms.
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "blueest sky".
In Beijing, you can meet people anytime, anywhere, or take a picture with your smartphone or SLR camera.
On social media platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, you can see photos of the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Gate, the Bird's Nest, and the Alley in the eyes of netizens.
Some netizens said that such a "scenic film" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; some netizens joked that if such a blue sky is brushed for a long time, people with cervical spine disease can be cured; some netizens hope that "this blue will overcome winter and welcome spring and summer, so that the sky of Beijing will be blue all four seasons".
Why do Beijingers love the blue sky so much?
Only because the people living in this city suffered from haze in the past, they are especially longing for the blue sky, and the "blue sky defense war" was launched in Beijing, after the continuous improvement of air quality, the haze became less and the blue sky increased.
On the day of the National Day, the weather was fine in Beijing.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations showed "level one excellent" green.
The "Blueest Sky" photo contest is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing these days?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in August this year, the best record in the same period in nearly five years.
Real-time concentrations of PM2.5 were in the single digits in September.
A major factor in the emergence of the "blueest sky" is the general favorable weather conditions in recent times. More importantly, Beijing has persistently carried out air pollution control, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits have continued to be released.
In 2013, Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017.
According to the plan, the authorities continue to guide the evacuation of non-capital functions, promote clean energy replacement and pollution reduction, and eliminate a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has become the first major city in mainland China to achieve full network gasification.
According to the data, between 2013 and 2017, the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%, the number of days with air quality standards increased by 50, the number of days with first-class air quality standards increased by 25, the number of days with heavy pollution decreased by 35, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
At the same time as the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing officials released a three-year action plan for Beijing to win the blue sky defense war in September this year, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis. In response to the current stage of governance and pollution characteristics, focusing on the key areas of prevention and control such as diesel trucks, dust, and volatile organic matter governance, optimizing the adjustment of transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthening regional joint prevention and control, focusing on strengthening urban refinement management, and comprehensively promoting green development.
During the National Day Golden Week this year, the relevant departments such as the Municipal Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce, City Administration and Public Security will strengthen law enforcement inspections of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six black" chaos of tourism.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "one-day trips" and deploy special operations to further crack down on illegal "one-day trips".
It was revealed at the meeting that the city has launched a special operation to crack down on illegal "one-day trips" since July 28, focusing on the "six black" chaos of black ticketing, black guidance, black organizations, black cars, black shops, and black network interests.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has received 39 complaints of "one-day trips", down 63% year-on-year; this year, the city has received 270 complaints of "one-day trips", down 62% year-on-year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars", investigated 158 violations of tourist transportation business, closed 29 "black shops" and entertainment venues, investigated 13 "black organizations", 27 "black guides", confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal "one-day tour" billboards, 3 fake bus stops, investigated 1,789 violations of various travel-related violations, 181 cases were filed by various functional departments, from heavy fines to 4.48 million yuan, and 111 travel-related violations were detained.
After the correction, the illegal "one-day trip" chaos was basically curbed, and the "one-day trip" market order showed a stable and improving situation.
According to reports, the city has stepped up efforts to crack down on illegal "day trips" in recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the city's tourism commission accepted 1,612 and 897 complaints about "one-day tours", down 79% and 44% respectively, but illegal "one-day tours" are still rampant and often rebound.
Specifically, illegal street hacking personnel are "black ticket", illegal websites that publish false tourism information are "black net", travel agencies that engage in illegal "day trips" or agencies or individuals that do not have the qualifications to operate travel agencies are "black network", guides who are employed by "black network" without a guide certificate or practice in violation of the law are "black guide", vehicles that are used to transport unqualified tourists or vehicles that provide passenger transportation services for illegal "day trips" are "black car", and they will eventually bring tourists into the designated tourist shopping malls.
In the special operation, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day tours", and the relevant departments sent secret inspection groups to accompany the secret inspection of illegal "one-day tours".
Among them, "black cars" and "black shops" became two of the strict focuses of the special operations.
It is reported that without black cars, illegal "day trips" cannot be made, black cars are easy to find, remember and investigate, and they are also fixed assets of high value.
Relevant departments should use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of tourist buses on key "day trip" routes, and use technological and intelligent means such as technical prevention and material protection to detect and detain "black cars" in a timely manner.
Tourism and shopping "black shops" have also become a serious focus due to their small number and sedentary operation.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and suppression of illegal "one-day tours", whenever violations are found in the special operation, all functional departments will impose strict punishments in accordance with the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to cracking down on illegal "one-day trips", and discussed measures to combine administrative punishment with imprisonment.
The city's tourism commission said it will encourage more regular travel agencies to organize "one-day tours" in Beijing in the future, and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours" to further squeeze out the living space of illegal "one-day tours".
In addition, the city's tourism commission is constantly improving the information system for electronic itineraries for tour groups to ensure that each group is included in the supervision of electronic itineraries.
From a tourist symbol to a symbol of the digital economy, what has happened to Wuzhen over the years?
As the permanent host of the World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has received a lot of attention.
In the five years since the first World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has changed dramatically.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town, but by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Conference has enabled local enterprises to accept the digital economy and the digital wave from zero distance. The desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong.
Wu Township Party Committee Secretary Yang said that Wu Township will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched a 5G pilot based on 4G communication network and free WiFi coverage.
At the same time, Wu Town is located in the city of Wuqing, which is the first county-level city in the country to build an international Internet data dedicated channel, and has become a hotbed for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, a total of 565 digital economy projects have been introduced, with a planned total investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, an increase of 13% year on year.
"Before, Wuzhen was a symbol of tourism, later it became a symbol of theater and culture.
Sheng Yongjun, secretary of the city's committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference have accumulated over time, so it is also necessary to build a platform to undertake the overlapping import of elements such as talents, projects and technologies.
After working abroad for 20 years, Shen Yi, a native of Yancheng, returned to his hometown to start a business.
On December 2 last year, he entered the 4th Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity anti-tampering digital technology solution, which was favored by many customers.
"In Wuzhen, recruiting people is easier than I thought, and our application has also landed quickly, and Wuzhen Smart Parking Project has our application".

This north-south thoroughfare is not only a tourist attraction, but also an industrial avenue.
It was the basis for the creation of the Wuzhen Avenue Innovation Cluster.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position for the development of rural industries, taking the lead in applying a large number of results such as smart medical care, smart retirement, and smart government, and bringing together industries accounting for 80% of the city's GDP and many high-level talents.
At least 410 killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
According to the Director of the Public Information Bureau of Jakarta Police, 410 people have been killed in the earthquake in Central Sulawesi, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
The survival rate of premature babies born at 29 weeks and above has reached 98% in China, reaching the level of developed countries.
SHANGHAI, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- The National Children's Medical Center and the Pediatric Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it has introduced Canadian advanced methods in the leading "China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infant Prognosis and Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project show that with active treatment, the survival rate of preterm infants aged 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
Over the past two decades, the Chinese government has focused on the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average and reaches the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Project for Improving the Quality of Prognosis of Premature Infants in China's NICU Hospitals" has greatly improved the quality of life of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of preterm infants, it is important to pay attention to reducing the survival quality of preterm infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, improving the overall outcome of children.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the China NICU Project for Improving the Quality of Prognosis of Premature Infants has enrolled tens of thousands of premature infants aged 33 weeks and younger nationwide, reducing the mortality rate of premature infants of small fetal age and low birth weight by one-third, while significantly reducing the incidence of serious complications in premature infants.
By establishing a national collaborative network for improving the quality of newborns, introducing the concept of collaborative quality improvement, and radiating 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China, the project established a complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method for improving the prognosis of preterm infants and improving the level of neonatal care.
Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is joining forces with the national neonatal pediatrics to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, providing reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "Project to Improve the Quality of Preterm Infant Prognosis in China", the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, and is committed to solving the problem of premature infant infection plaguing China's neonatal intensive care units.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the complication-free survival rate of premature babies in Canada has increased by about one-third.
The EPIQ method is now used in all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted in 6 countries.
The pediatrician revealed that the results showed a 35% reduction in infections in preterm infants and a 20% reduction in antibiotic use two years after the EPIQ intervention.
In the future, Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this method throughout the country, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature babies and improving the quality of newborn care throughout the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and unevenness in the quality of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation. This study covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and other western provinces, in order to gradually promote the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment nationwide.
It is understood that Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is joining the national neonatal pediatric force to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is revealed that in 2019, the China Newborn Collaboration Network, a coordination center located at the Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University, will unite 63 hospitals nationwide to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement in order to promote the uniform development of newborn care in China.
Yang Zhenlei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become the center of Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system, service quality and service results should have a place in Asia.
Xin Zhenping: Build a "heroic monument" in your heart - written on the fifth anniversary of martyrdom.
On September 30, the eve of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the fifth anniversary of the martyrs' anniversary, Xi Jinping and the leaders of the Equality Party and the State came to Tiananmen Square to attend the wreath-laying ceremony for the people's heroes.
At this moment, wherever you are, please pay tribute to Yingluck.
The anniversary is a reminder and a wake-up call.
If we open the heavy history, behind each martyr's name, there is a living life.
They also have a fiery youth, a sincere love and a caring family.
However, because they firmly believe that "the righteousness of our faith is the truth of the universe", they are willing to sacrifice everything in order to "save the next generation from suffering".
"The day I live, I will cry for China".
Through time and space, the heroes have erected a spiritual signpost to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from and where are you going?" "What kind of person are you?"
To commemorate Yingluck, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war, about 20 million martyrs have sacrificed their lives for national independence, people's liberation, and the country's wealth and strength.
For various reasons, many of the martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes have poured their blood into the ideals, practiced their faith with their lives, remembered their noble names and inherited their spirit, which is to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This "heroic monument" must not be desecrated or destroyed.
For some time now, there has been an undercurrent of historical nihilism and pan-entertainment.
All kinds of distortion of history and denigration of heroic practices challenge the conscience of justice and confuse value judgments, causing public outrage and vigilance throughout society.
Heroes are not allowed to blaspheme, heroes cannot forget.
We must not tolerate actions that touch the bottom line, we must be brave and defend our dignity with the rule of law.
On May 1, the Law for the Protection of Heroic Martyrs came into effect.
Judging from the judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is very popular, which effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases the positive energy of revering heroes and venerating ancestors.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
It has become a universal social consensus to commemorate our ancestors and call upon our heroes.
At present, there are more than a million memorials of all kinds in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Mausoleum every year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
Let the hero worship, defend the hero, learn the hero, care about the hero, let the heroic spirit be integrated into the national bloodline, and a "hero monument" will stand firmly between heaven and earth, deep in people's hearts.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The European Union took a non-confrontational stance on Friday after Italy defied EU demands to surprise markets with a massive budget deficit plan, but may take a more aggressive stance if Italy insists on too bold a target.
Italy's Eurosceptic government is targeting a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, suggesting that debt reduction is not on the cards despite demands to cut the deficit.
"We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy", said the European Commission's economic affairs commissioner, Mario Moscovici, on Friday, responding cautiously to the suggestion that the EU's proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats remain hopeful that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally submitted to the European Commission in October.
Following the government's announcement of its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday and Italian bond yields hit their highest in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission may reject Italy's draft budget, something it has never done for any country.
Speaking at a conference in the Latvian capital Riga later on Friday, European Commission Vice President Andris Piebalgs said Italy's current fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact", referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how the EU would react.
Tenderers can submit their applications to participate in the open tender until October 26 this year.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture listed China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Inspectorate announced that Russian grain exports to China in the current agricultural year exceeded 1 million tons for the first time, setting a new record.
The agency predicts that China may enter the top 10 Russian food importers.
Sapporo, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- Following their 3-0 win over Cuba in their opening match, the Chinese women's volleyball team defeated Turkey 3-0 on Sept. 30 to win their second consecutive group match of the 2018 World Championships.
However, compared to the First Sino-Japanese War, the role of Chinese women in this war is more difficult.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 World Women's Volleyball Championship, with China in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
Based on the world ranking and overall strength of the teams in Group B, Turkey and Italy are the main rivals of China.
After the start of the game, the Chinese team quickly entered the state, took the lead at the beginning, maintained the advantage throughout, put a lot of pressure on the opponent on the serve and the net, and took the first inning more smoothly at 25:18.
The Turkish team, which entered the second inning, started very fiercely and took a 6-2 lead. After the Chinese team requested a suspension, they adjusted their formation and gradually chased the score to 7 and then scored several times, scoring 7:0.
In the third game, the score was tied at 19.
At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake, the Chinese team took the lead at 21:19, and won the game point at 24:21 with Zhu Feng's strong catch and Zhang Zhenning's attack; then the Turkish team chased the score to 23:24.
Chinese women's volleyball head coach Lang Ping admitted after the match that the whole match was not easy.
"We are well-prepared, our interceptions are good, the Turkish team is more technical, we must reduce our mistakes and try to win through our own initiative".
Facing her former teammates, Zhu, who plays for Turkey's VakifBank, was restricted in the first game of the day, but then she took the initiative to change and still played a strong offense.
"They are familiar with each other, and it is normal to be blocked by the opponent, but the Chinese team played extremely well, blocking the net and attacking in a bad situation".
Next, the Chinese women's volleyball team will take a one-day break for physical and technical training; on October 2, they will face the third opponent of the group, Canada.
On September 30, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for key projects in the second half of 2018 in Hengshui Gaoxin District, Hebei.
On the same day, six projects began construction, with a total investment of 4.29 billion yuan.
On the same day, the Standing Committee of the Yangshuo Municipal Committee and the Vice Mayor of Yangshuo announced the start of construction.
According to the director of the management committee of Hebei Yengshui High-tech Zone, Zheng Shuanghui, the six projects started today with a total investment of 4.29 billion yuan are industrial projects, including the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, as well as the introduction of new industries, covering military and civilian integration, cloud factories, food, medicine, chemicals and other industries.
It is believed that the construction and commissioning of these projects will inject strong impetus into the goal of "building a 100 billion-level industrial park and striving to create a national-level high-tech zone" in the high-tech zone in advance.
The Vice Mayor of Yangshuo City announced the start of the project.
He said that the district has successfully carried out a series of major activities such as the China-Yangshuo International Life Sciences Summit, Yangda Health Industry Development Forum, the Academy of Chinese Academy of Sciences Yangshuo Summit on High-end Equipment Industry, and the 2018 Yangshuo Beijing-Tianjin "Double Synergy" Innovation Forum.
The Central American Stem Cell Project will be officially put into production by the end of the year.
Construction has begun on the 10,000-ton test base of the China Science and Technology Complex Project, the first in China and the world's largest experimental platform for supercritical carbon dioxide compressors with a capacity of 1 MW.
The construction of Xiongan Advanced Supercomputing Center, which ranks among the top ten in the world in terms of computing power, has been approved by the province and the city.
He said that by the end of the year, the main projects of the second phase of the technology valley of 240,000 square meters, including three research and development bases and exhibition centers for digital information, new energy and new materials, and life and health, will be completed.
We will actively build an "upgraded version" of the "Chinese Academy of Sciences +" innovation model, build a "one platform, one base for the two academies", and promote the integration of scientific and technological achievements and innovation through interdisciplinary intersections, multi-unit collaboration, and multi-industry integration.
Nearly a thousand state-owned attractions cut ticket prices, more than half by more than 20%
[Abstract] As of September 28, 981 free opening or price reduction measures (74 free opening and 907 price reduction) have been implemented or published to the public.
In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the State Council Work Report, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued guidelines on June 28 on improving the ticket price formation mechanism for national scenic spots and reducing ticket prices in key national scenic spots (hereinafter referred to as guidelines).
In accordance with the deployment requirements, work has been actively carried out in various places, and the ticket prices of a number of key state-owned scenic spots have been reduced one after another.
As of September 28, 981 free opening or price reduction measures (74 free opening and 907 price reduction) have been announced to the public, of which 159 are 5A scenic spots and 534 are 4A scenic spots.
Of the 907 scenic spots where prices were reduced, 491 were reduced by more than 20%, accounting for 54.3%, and 214 were reduced by more than 30%, accounting for 23.6%.
The number of discounted scenic spots in Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces is large, of which the number of discounted scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, with a total decrease of more than 30%.
All 5A-rated scenic spots in eight provinces (districts and cities) including Anhui and Chongqing have achieved price reductions.
The price reduction has been implemented in scenic spots such as Yunnan Shilin, Dali San Tower, Yulong Snow Mountain, Zhejiang, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Hunan Zhangjiakou, Shaanxi Jinmao, Jiangxi Sanqing Mountain and Xinjiang Kanas.
The price of tickets for key state-owned scenic spots will gradually return to a reasonable range, which will help promote the tourism industry to accelerate the transformation from ticket economy to industrial economy, small-scale tourism to mass tourism, and attraction tourism to all-region tourism, which will help form a virtuous circle of tourism supply structure optimization and steady expansion of tourism consumption demand.
The National Development and Reform Commission also stressed that all places should strengthen the price order of scenic spots, guide scenic spots to improve services, and ensure that prices are not reduced.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out a special inspection of the recent media reports that the price of tickets for individual scenic spots has been reduced too little and the price has not been reduced.
Trade Promotion Bureau conducts short, medium and long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a report on the short, medium and long-term optimization of "major investment immigration" and "technical immigration".
The Office of Trade Promotion and Economic Development will inform all sectors of society about the relevant optimization work as soon as possible.
Five of these are short-term measures to be implemented this year, five are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019, and one is a long-term measure.
In addition, in accordance with the instruction of Liang Weit, director of the Economic and Financial Affairs Department, the Trade Promotion Bureau also comprehensively examined the internal management system.
Five short-term measures to be implemented during the year include:
1. Undertakes review work. Priority shall be given to reviewing cases that are about to expire in seven years, cases mentioned in the report of the Commission on Human Rights, and newly renewed cases. Cases where improprieties or indications of violations are found shall be referred to the relevant judicial organs for follow-up;
2. Field visits to projects involving "significant investment immigration". By the end of September, more than 20 investment projects had been visited;
3. Undertakes a comprehensive review of the current evaluation system. The six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established for the evaluation of applications for "major investment immigration" and the approval mechanism for the evaluation of applications for "skilled immigration" will be improved by specifying the elements conducive to the development of Australia and the conditions for the priority recruitment of talents. A list of "five industries and ten occupations" for the annual priority recruitment of talents has also been drawn up to better target the recruitment of talents in line with the policy direction of the Government of the SAR;

Regarding long-term measures, it is expected that the drafting of relevant regulations will be carried out in the first half of 2019, with the aim of completing them as soon as possible, further clarifying the approval criteria, review mechanisms and confirmation mechanisms for temporary residence permits, and increasing the investigation function of the Trade Promotion Bureau to more accurately approve and supervise temporary residence permit applications.
Experts from the national film-free cotton on-site observation and research and exchange activities went to the experimental field to listen to the representative of the academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang Shaya, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The experimental base for growing uncoated cotton in Xinjiang's Shaya County, where uncoated cotton is "not inferior" to the coated cotton next to it, is full of people.
From September 27th to 28th, the national film-free cotton observation workshop was held in Xinjiang's Xaya County.
At the observation meeting, the reporter learned that the filmless cotton technology system based on "China Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures has initially achieved the goal of filmless cultivation of cotton fields, reduced the pollution of Xinjiang cotton field residues on the ecological environment and raw cotton, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of filmless cotton technology.
Zhao Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a renowned cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system cotton system, gave a presentation on membrane-free cotton growth to Zhou Guo, party secretary of Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Forestry.
"The integrated membrane-free cotton technology we have developed can completely realize the cultivation of cotton without a membrane, which can completely solve the problem of membrane pollution and achieve green cotton cultivation".
This post is part of our special coverage Global Development 2011.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing region in China. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the area under cotton cultivation in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million tons, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of geomembrane in China in 1982, the area of all kinds of crop coverage in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million tons, and the annual use of geomembrane is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton ground coverage rate reached 100%, and the cotton field coverage accounted for about 60% of the use of Xinjiang ground cover.
The production of non-woven cotton is tested, and the production of cotton can fully achieve the production of 320 kg to 350 kg of silk.
With the continuous increase in the amount of geomembrane input in Xinjiang, a series of problems such as low residual geomembrane recycling rate, gradual increase in the amount of residual geomembrane in the soil, and damage to soil structure caused by residual geomembrane have seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang's cotton harvesting area was about 14 million tons.
In the process of mechanized cotton harvesting, a large amount of debris on the surface and on the cotton stalk is ingested. The debris mixed in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and cannot be completely removed during the subsequent textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national film-free cotton live observation workshop was held in Xinjiang's Xaya County.
In order to solve the problem of cotton field membrane pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Huang Shuxun led his team to implement the "China Cotton 619" membrane-free cotton technology planting for 8 years, adding "wings" to the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
Zhuo Shuxun introduced that through innovative breeding ideas, a new variety of land cotton "Chinese Cotton 619" has been developed, which is extremely early ripe, salt-resistant, cold-resistant and productive.
Under the condition of membrane-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang, China Cotton 619 has implemented a series of supporting measures such as membrane-free planting machinery support, planting depth improvement, shallow burial of drip tape under membrane-free conditions, suitable planting density screening, and rational chemical regulation.
At present, the production of film-free cotton has reached 4,800 kg per hectare in Aksu, Kuller and Aral.
The film-free cultivation of cotton has achieved high yields, cost savings, environmental protection, and comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Xuehai, an agronomist at the Agricultural University of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology, the production of membrane-free cotton can fully achieve a cotton yield of 320 kg to 350 kg, or even higher.
"There are great prospects for the promotion of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology".
Zhang Xuehai believes that at present, membrane-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual pollution, but there is still a certain gap compared with the economic benefits of membrane cultivation.
"Supporting the purchase price of cotton will help promote it in the future".
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of non-woven cotton, make the non-woven cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the ground membrane.

At present, the Agricultural Bank has invested 5.2 billion yuan to support the acquisition of 11.58 billion kg of autumn grain by various food acquisition entities.
120 major food procurement entities have set up nearly 300 procurement outlets in Jilin Province, ensuring "full coverage" of the main food producing counties, leaving no "gap" in the supply of procurement funds.
According to the progress of the acquisition and the needs of the enterprise, if the size of the acquisition funds is insufficient, the Agricultural Bank will apply for additional funds on the basis of 20 billion yuan of credit funds to ensure timely and adequate supply of funds, maintain the stability of the food market and protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalist taken away by police at UK Conservative Party conference, China apologises
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered a reporter's question about a Chinese journalist being taken away by the police during the annual conference of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom.
We demand that the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and demand that the conference organizers apologize to Chinese journalists.
Q: On September 30, during the annual conference of the British Conservative Party, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong, inviting the Hong Kong opposition to speak.
A Chinese journalist was taken away by the police during the meeting.
What do you have to say?
In response, the spokesperson said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong returned to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" has achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements have been recognized by the world.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Chinese side expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction over the Conservative Party's Human Rights Commission using the sidelines of the party's annual conference to showcase anti-China separatist forces.
We firmly oppose anyone or any organization interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any conspiracy and action to promote "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The spokesman said it was totally unacceptable that while the UK had always stood for freedom of speech, Chinese journalists were blocked and even physically assaulted when they asked questions to express their views.
We demand that the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and demand that the conference organizers apologize to Chinese journalists.

Speaking at the US Council on Foreign Relations on Friday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China-US relations have once again reached a crossroads, and a better future can be opened if the two sides can actively and inclusively view each other, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions.
"The China-U.S. relationship is our common asset and we need to protect it together".
He expressed the hope that people of understanding in all walks of life in the two countries will take practical actions to safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-US relations and jointly promote China-US relations to continue moving in the right direction.
Wang Yi also reiterated that China will definitely take a different development path from the traditional great powers.
This path with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of the United States, and that China will neither become the United States, nor challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In a speech titled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Rivals", Wang said that the deep-seated symptom of the current problem is that some American friends believe that China will also be strong and will even challenge and replace America's leadership in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation".
But this kind of self-serving suspicion is spreading, he said, and it is magnifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts, and making it more difficult and more resistant to resolve specific issues between China and the United States.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the gene for outward expansion.
I believe that all countries can live together in harmony and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will neither copy foreign models nor ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that China-US cooperation would be a win-win situation, and confrontation would inevitably be a lose-lose situation.
China is always committed to developing long-term healthy and stable Sino-US relations, achieving non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China's state news agency held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret Liu's white paper on China-US economic and trade frictions and China's position.
At the press conference, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce of China Yang Jiechi said that China is willing to make efforts to promote the development of bilateral trade in a more balanced direction, and hopes that the United States can also show a positive attitude.
According to foreign media reports, the death toll has risen to 1,200 after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on September 28, causing severe damage to several coastal cities.
The town of Donggala in Palu, close to the epicenter of the quake, was reportedly hit by two tsunami waves, and authorities believe the death toll will continue to rise as the "golden 72 hours" of rescue efforts pass.
Rescuers carry an earthquake survivor who was pulled from the rubble of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, on September 30, 2018.
Officials at the disaster agency said the tsunami caused waves up to 6 meters high, and the earthquake and tsunami affected more people than previously estimated.
Hundreds of people were reportedly celebrating on a beach in Palu when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Officials said the tsunami came ashore at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, destroying many buildings and infrastructure.
Thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed and a major road in Palu was cut off by a tsunami-triggered mudslide, he said.
A bridge over a coastal river in Sulawesi collapsed.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the quake-hit city of West Palu in Central Sulawesi on September 30 local time.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited the disaster area on September 30, said he had sent troops to help with the search and rescue, and called on people to be patient.
The rescue operation was difficult due to the lack of heavy machinery and manpower, Zoko pointed out.
He learned that there was a shortage of water, food and fuel in the affected areas, and that many businesses had closed after the earthquake.
He urged people to be patient and stay where they are until help arrives.
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palu said they heard cries for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but were unable to remove the rubble without heavy machinery.
Indonesia's vice president said the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands as power and communications were cut off in some areas.

At the same time, the provincial courts have carried out "five-in-one" activities in accordance with the law to fine a group, detain a group, restrict consumption a group, punish a group for breach of trust, and transfer a group that refuses to commit a crime.
At the beginning of the campaign, there were more than 132,000 pending cases in the courts of the province, and at the end of July, the cases were cleared.

"Where can I get a taxi, please?"
We want to go to Kim Il Sung Square to see the National Flag Raising Ceremony!"
Mr. and Mrs. Yang, who were travelling from Ningxia to Shenzhen by plane and then switched to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen high-speed railway on the first National Day train, were interviewed by a reporter from Xinhua on the morning of October 1 at West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong.
On the morning of October 1, the Hong Kong SAR government held a flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Jubilee Plaza to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
According to the statistics of the Hong Kong Immigration and Checkpoints, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong through West Kowloon Station has exceeded 300,000.
To coincide with the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon border checkpoint is expected to see a peak of tourists visiting Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
Reporters spotted a large number of mainland travelers in the arrivals hall at 7 a.m. on the morning of the 1st, taking advantage of the National Day Golden Week to travel around Hong Kong by high-speed train.
Mrs. Yang, who walks briskly, told reporters that the National Day holiday is one of the longest holidays of the year.
However, due to the inconvenience of flights to and from Hong Kong in Ningxia, Mr. Liu checked the train schedule and found that the first train would arrive at 7:03 a.m.
He told reporters, "The train is so convenient, fast and on time".
There are 70 one-hour short-distance trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon every day.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is preparing to meet his Hong Kong friends at the summit of Mt.
"Both the mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday for the National Day, so we're going to challenge ourselves to see if we can complete the 50km Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explains that if it weren't for the high-speed railway, the convenience of travel and the time available, they wouldn't have dared to attempt such a long-distance hike.
A mother from Dongguan took her 10-year-old son on a high-speed train to Hong Kong to participate in a piano competition.
She had previously travelled to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming and she was worried about her son's condition. She was even more impressed by the high-speed train to Shenzhen, the ease of customs clearance, the half-time and the Hong Kong section.
At 6:44 a.m. on September 23, the G5711 Harmony train departed from Shenzhen North Station and sped all the way to the Hong Kong section of the Guangdong-Hong Kong High-Speed Railway.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, which is integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes mainland passengers from different provinces in Tianjin and Hebei.
Mr. Gao, who came from Changsha to visit his relatives, told reporters that before the high-speed train could only go to Shenzhen North, take the subway through Hong Kong and then go around the city, instead of taking the trouble and time, now directly to Kowloon Center, home to eat lunch made by children, feel very happy.
He said that the convenience of the "two checks in one place" customs clearance process is beyond imagination, "In less than 10 minutes, both checkpoints are over".
The West Kowloon Station, which is adjacent to the airport express line and connects land and air transport, has also become the first choice for many transit passengers.
"I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch the plane, I didn't think it would be so soon, there's plenty of time!"
The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will preserve the ability of U.S. President Donald Trump to implement his threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts from tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, according to a trade agreement side-arrangement unveiled Monday.
If Trump imposes the so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will each have a quota of 2.6 million passenger vehicles exported to the United States each year exempt from paying the tariffs.
According to the side agreement, pickup trucks produced in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual $108 billion auto parts tariff-exempt quota and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are significantly higher than current production levels in both countries, providing room for growth in exports.
WASHINGTON/MEXICO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - After days of wrangling, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade policy differences, Mexico said on Friday, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will remain a trilateral agreement.
While details are scarce, the apparent progress was enough to prompt the Mexican and U.S. governments to abruptly halt plans to publish the text of their trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made a new counterproposal to the Canadian government and said he would continue to push for all three countries to join NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the timing of the submission of the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and US lawmakers has been delayed because the Canadian and US governments are "very serious" about trying to reach an agreement.
"In the next 48 hours we will know if we have reached a tripartite text or if we will have to publish a bipartite text", Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts "specifically requested" the delay.
A spokesperson for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) declined to comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement or the U.S.-Canada negotiations.
Officials from the Canadian Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Minister's Office did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
It's hard to see anything unusual about two young lions frolicking together at a conservation centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first-ever birth of a lion cub by artificial insemination - the first in the world".
Scientists at the school are studying the reproductive system of the mother African lion.
Ganswindt, director of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, said the cubs, born on 25 August, were healthy and normal.
His team achieved the breakthrough after 18 months of intensive experimentation.
"We collected sperm from a healthy male lion", Ganswindt told the media.
Next, the researchers waited for the hormone levels in the lioness's body to reach the right level before artificially inseminating her.
"Fortunately, it worked", said Ganswindt.
He said the researchers "made several attempts, but surprisingly, they didn't take much effort".
He said the breakthrough can be replicated and scientists hope to use the technology to save endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature says lions are extinct in 26 African countries and that the total number of wild lions has declined by 43 percent in the past 20 years to about 20,000.
African lions are listed as endangered by the organization.
"If we don't do something for these animals, they will face extinction", says Ganswindt.
He says the new technique does not require the lions to be bred, but simply injects sperm into a fertile lioness, as is done with captive elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea's exports fell by the most in more than two years in September, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite heightened trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's September exports posted their biggest year-on-year decline since July 2016, falling more than the 5.7 percent estimated by 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Preliminary figures released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, the 23rd consecutive month of expansion, despite fears that the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China could hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors.
South Korea's exports to the U.S. fell 11.8% due to lower sales of petroleum products.
Overseas sales of South Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite market fears that the so-called chip "super cycle" may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports rely to a considerable extent on the US and Chinese markets".
Imports fell 2.1 percent to $40.8 billion, less than the 3.1 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll.
The trade surplus in September was initially valued at $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and EU countries, the global manufacturing industry will continue to flourish, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
"The increase in export prices due to the rise in oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year", the statement said.
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the US and China, coupled with increased market volatility after the US interest rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports".
Exports increased to an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September from $2.1 billion in August.
This year's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four fewer than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports in January-September increased by 4.7% compared to the same period last year.
South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, according to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, but was supported by domestic orders, as declining orders from China and Japan threatened to cloud the outlook for other exports.
North Korean media criticizes US for not easing sanctions
North Korea's KCNA news agency published a signed commentary on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK but not easing sanctions on the DPRK, calling it a "self-contradictory" practice.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to implement sanctions against the DPRK", stressing that the United States continues to implement UN sanctions resolutions.
In the Singapore DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-U.S. relationship in accordance with the aspirations of the DPRK and U.S. peoples for peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that the United States is increasing the pressure of sanctions and demanding dialogue, which is self-contradictory.
If we want to build a new DPRK-U.S. relationship, permanently consolidate the peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, and achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should prioritize building trust and solve it step by step, starting with what can be done.
The article also says that the United States should understand that sanctions do not work against North Korea.
The article says that even the North Devinsk, which preceded the Kazan, was admired by the US military.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will face a powerful potential adversary. Just look at the submarine 'North Devinsk'".
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, also praised the submarine.
He said: "The submarine is impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources, you will see that its main efforts in research and development are, first of all, to strengthen the submarine fleet".
However, the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe that the West still has asymmetric advantages", Foggo said.
Earlier it was reported that the Russian Navy will be equipped with the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Arkhangelsk class multipurpose submarines are modified White Oak-M submarines with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a diving depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64, an underwater speed of 31 knots, and will carry mines, torpedoes and Kalibr and Gamma-ray cruise missiles.

This is his first time attending the forum.
Ignore the US threats!
EU may reach crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The US government has announced that it will re-impose a new round of sanctions on Iran in November and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
But America's allies don't seem to be listening.
According to the New York Times, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif revealed in an interview on the 29th that Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on crude oil sales, despite US threats to sanction any country doing business with Iran.
At the heart of the agreement is an attempt to establish a new payment mechanism that would replace dollar transactions with barter or local currency.
The purpose of this method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is working on the deal, some officials in France and the UK are concerned that if it comes to fruition, it will be the most public confrontation yet between the EU and the US, which opposes the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif sounded more optimistic than he has in recent months.
The agreement has the potential to "deprive" the US of its traditional allies and effectively break the US's attempts to cut Iran's revenue.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it", Zarif said, arguing that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said recently that "no sovereign country or organization can accept others deciding with whom it can trade".
However, she also predicts that before the next round of sanctions are imposed by the US government in November, US leaders may take a series of financial measures aimed at banks, merchants and countries doing business with Tehran.
In May, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, citing flaws in the agreement and saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat caused some companies to pull out of Tehran, and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investments in Iran.
British and French officials have said that the US government could "get the upper hand".
Indeed, according to a recent report in the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have had much impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "lure" Iran into violating the agreement.
Zarif was also taken aback by the barrage of verbal attacks from the US, and even laughed when asked if the US was going to topple the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, "It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real aim of the US".

Reporters learned from the National Health and Health Commission that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased compared to decades ago, but the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important idea is to maintain a healthy body weight, promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the 2018 edition of the Key Information and Interpretation of Health Education for Adolescents in China, published by the National Health and Welfare Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and indiscriminate weight loss are not good for health.
The health risks behind the "little fat man" cannot be ignored.
Ding Xiaqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight and obesity endanger the normal growth and development of adolescents, have adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even cause high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, overweight and obesity in adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adolescents.
Ding said that the survey of the nutrition and health status of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the overweight rate of children and adolescents aged 6-17 in China was 9.6%, the obesity rate was 6.4%, and the two together were 16%.
At the same time, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is higher in boys than in girls and higher in cities than in rural areas, and the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How are teenagers coping with overweight and obesity?
Zhang Yi, deputy director of the Research Center for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion of the National Sports Administration, pointed out that the main cause of obesity among adolescents is excessive caloric intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this type of simple obesity, scientific exercise should be combined with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Yi pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is "curing untreated diseases", and an important part of this is to conduct comprehensive science education for schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raise awareness of prevention among adolescents.
Adolescents should regularly undergo physical examination and monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight to detect early and scientifically determine whether overweight and obesity problems occur so that timely intervention measures can be taken.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Xiaojing recommends that in addition to proactively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, and should avoid using starvation or semi-starvation therapy to control and lose weight.
Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital login codes that gave them access to nearly 50 million user accounts in an unprecedented and its worst-ever security breach.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not yet determined whether the attackers had misused any accounts or stolen personal information.

China News Agency Yiwu, Oct. 1 (Minghui.org) The newly revised Shijiazhuang-Guizhou Shijiazhuang waterway hub navigation dispatch regulation (hereinafter referred to as Shijiazhuang dispatch regulation) officially began to be implemented on October 1.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, navigation in the waters of the Three Gorges-Gansu Strait is in good order.
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Administration issued the first security inspection plan at 21:00 on September 30 and carried out security inspections on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security inspection.
On October 1, the Department of Navigation scheduled the first filtering program after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security inspection plan will be issued once a day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the filtration plan will be issued once a day at 14:00 and 20:00, which will facilitate the flexible arrangement of the ship's filtration plan.
Addition of the ship filtering principle of "classification control" to the filtering of ships, clarifying the priority order of filtering ships according to the functional positioning of the cabin and the elevator, and adjusting the filtering of short-line passenger ships to the same priority level as the demonstration ships and integrity ships.
This is also the second anniversary of the lift's trial operation and the official unification with the cabin.
For the first time, large and medium-sized demonstration ships and new energy powered ships in the Yangtze River and Three Gorges region have also been given priority.
At the same time, the "Navigation and Dispatch Management Area" was adjusted from the previous 180 kilometers of the Yangtze River Bridge to the 541.8 kilometers of the Yangtze River Bridge, and divided into "core waters", "nearby waters", "control waters" and "dispatch waters".
This will help the ships to choose suitable waters for anchoring and reduce the backlog of anchored ships in the anchorage area.
According to the current ship filtering and waiting for filtering characteristics, the ship dispatching procedure also proposes integrity control measures such as cancellation of the declaration of violation of the ship, filtering delay of 24 hours.
After the Three Gorges reservoir, the navigation conditions in the Ku region were improved, which promoted the rapid development of Yangtze shipping.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges and Gansu ports increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
Over the past two years, 5,767 vessels have passed through the Three Gorges, carrying 1,622,000 passengers and 1,712,800 tons of cargo.
Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Shipping Administration Chen Winteryuan said that the filtering procedure has played a positive role in promoting the integrity of filtering management, maintaining the order of navigation between the two hubs, relieving the pressure on ships in the catchment area, and improving navigation capabilities.

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council has issued the Decision on Further Reducing the Pressure on Industrial Product Production License Management Catalogue and Simplifying the Approval Procedure.
Yang decided to further reduce the list of industrial product production license management, cancel 14 categories of industrial product production license management, and transfer 4 categories of industrial product production license management to the quality and technical supervision department of the provincial people's government.
As a result of the reform, the number of categories of products subject to industrial production license management will be reduced from 38 last year to 24 currently.
I decided to clarify and simplify the approval process for products in the catalogue.
First, the certification body's pre-certification product inspection will be replaced by a product inspection qualification report issued by a qualified inspection and testing institution submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, except for hazardous chemicals, after-sales on-site inspection of products licensed by the provincial people's government quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and administration department), enterprises submit applications and product inspection qualification reports and make commitments to ensure product quality and safety.
Third, if the enterprise produces different categories of products in the business catalogue, it shall issue a license in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one certificate" when applying for a new license or applying for a change of license.

Take supportive measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification to promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to improve the quality of industrial products in accordance with international advanced standards.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products with reserved industrial product production license management, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give full play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves, who supervises", dynamically evaluate product quality and safety risks, reduce the list in time, downgrade approval authority or switch to certification management.

Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points year on year.
According to Wu Qinghe, the manufacturing PMI this month is characterized by five main aspects:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing sector are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, 14 industries' PMIs are in the expansion range, of which pharmaceutical, special equipment, electrical and mechanical equipment and other manufacturing industries' PMIs are at a higher operating level of 53.5% or more and are growing faster.
The second is small fluctuations in supply and demand.

Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is aware that a prolonged period of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profitability of financial institutions and potentially destabilize the country's banking system, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday.
However, he said the BOJ needs to maintain its massive stimulus program while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies in light of sluggish inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies.
"The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing", Hirota said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions take on more risk to compensate for the shrinking profit margins caused by years of low interest rates, the banking system could be in turmoil in the event of a severe negative shock.
"Although the risks are not high at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor developments and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures", he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting released earlier on Monday showed that the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising costs of its long-term accommodative monetary policy at its September meeting.
The minutes of the meeting show that one member said that if the economic expansion continues, "the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in the future".
The minutes of the meeting show that another member said that the committee should discuss how long the BOJ can maintain its stimulus policy given its limitations on the duration of the policy.
The Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by its accommodative monetary policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to trade frictions between China and the United States and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited", said Hirota.
"But if the problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy could become bigger", he added.
"It is necessary to continue with a strong monetary easing policy, while considering the positive and negative effects in a balanced way", Hirota said.
Low inflation has forced the BOJ to maintain its aggressive stimulus plan, despite the growing disadvantages, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions.
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, Toshihiko Harada ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
Corporate logo on a Tesla electric car in Cardiff, United States on June 1, 2018.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have each agreed to pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators, and Musk will step down as the company's chairman but remain as CEO.
The settlement will put an end to two months of unrest at Tesla.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's announcement of the securities fraud settlement on Saturday will be a relief to investors.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal battle would only further hurt the loss-making electric car company.
The SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, saying his August 7 tweet misled investors.
He tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and had secured financing.
According to the SEC, the tweets were baseless and caused market turmoil that harmed investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should give Musk more oversight, while not taking the "devastating" step of kicking him out of Tesla.
The asset manager holds shares in Panasonic, Tesla's battery manufacturer.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls for Musk's external communications.
"It is in the best interest of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, for this matter to be resolved expeditiously under the agreed upon terms", SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations caused about $7 billion to evaporate from Tesla's market value, which was $45.2 billion on Friday, below GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC withdrew its request to remove Musk from the company's helm.
Many investors said the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned", said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and called the SEC penalty a "light rebuke" for Musk.
"He is still important to Tesla as CEO".
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The settlement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Yi) Beijing Morning News reporter recently learned from Beijing Construction Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park, the Beijing World Expo Performing Arts Plaza Project, will use a multi-color ETFE jigsaw membrane structure for the first time. The 5,440 square meter membrane structure will be presented in six colors: deep red, deep green, orange, blue, red and green.
According to Liu Changbao, project manager of Beijing Construction Five Construction Group, the construction area of the performance square is 4,500 square meters, with a total steel capacity of 1,182 tons, and the steel structure roof is supported by 26 hinged steel trusses.
"From the sky overlooking the performance square, the colorful roofs look like flowers, dancing butterflies, and the bright colors do not fade with time and wind and rain".
Previously, single-color ETFE membrane structure has been widely used in bird's nest, water cube and other projects, but the multi-color ETFE membrane structure is still the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers in the world with the ability to produce a variety of color film structures, each inch of film structure material is very "precious".
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid overlapping and "fighting" problems at the end of the rope, an innovative "double-forked ear" rope structure will also be adopted, and a special fixed plug will be used to ensure that the "fighting" rope ends in the correct position.
Construction of the park is currently underway.
Among them, the International Pavilion Project has completed the installation of all the "flowerbeds".
The project is scheduled to be ready for deployment by the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence in the private economy moving towards a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping's emphasis on "letting entrepreneurs get rid of the baggage of ideas and moving forward lightly" resonated strongly among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from the entrepreneurial spirit.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there have been thousands of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community has continued to push the Chinese economy forward.
For some time now, some people in society have expressed some negative and skeptical remarks about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy out of the scene theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" have caused doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment affect some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of demand structure brings transformation and upgrading pressure; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effect is overlapping, or the work method is simple, resulting in some good policies.
A number of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs are showing a lot of anxiety.
In this context, it is of great practical significance to correct the misconceptions and remove the mental baggage of entrepreneurs, so that enterprises can focus on development, and the government can focus on promoting development.
At the symposium, the important thesis of the "three unchanged" was once again emphasized: "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!"
In recent years, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented importance to and provided unprecedented institutional support for entrepreneurs, from deepening the simplification and liberalization of power and establishing a power list system to creating a rule of law environment to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competitive market environment and shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society.
The symposium also clearly put forward six policy initiatives to support the development and growth of private enterprises, and launched a series of practical actions aimed at promoting the development of private enterprises.
This is a great encouragement for the entrepreneurial community and gives more hope to all sectors of society.
The fog has lifted, the course has been set, the key is implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve development difficulties, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading.
As China's economy moves towards high-quality development, more entrepreneurs are needed to fulfill their ambitions.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reforms and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities and move towards a broader stage.
All 46 supervision certificates for import and export in Inner Mongolia have been verified online - Xinhua
Xinhua News Network, November 5 (Reporter Li Aiping) The Hohhot Customs said on the 5th that since then, all 46 types of local import and export supervision certificates have been verified online, except for special cases such as confidentiality.
Enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare relevant documents to customs in a paperless manner, avoiding the problems of rush, paper application, and repeated submission.
It is understood that the preparation time of customs documents refers to the preparation time of all kinds of customs documents required for import and export links before declaring customs, which is a major factor affecting the overall customs clearance time.
Previously, 86 types of regulatory documents were required for customs verification in the import and export link, involving 19 sectors.
It is reported that in accordance with the principle of "cancellation of cancellation, merger of merger, exit port verification of exit port verification", the customs and 16 other issuing authorities system docking and data interconnection with the international trade "single window" platform.
Customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the relevant departments to submit paper applications, which was a long process and could not track the status of the audit in real time.
Business users can now apply online directly through the Single Window portal.
After the certification department passes the audit, the electronic data of the certificate is transmitted to the customs, and the automatic comparison, intelligent verification, and unified feedback of the audit results to the enterprises through the "single window" are realized in the customs clearance process.
Han Senhui's exports to China jumped 20 times in 4 years or related to the increase in empty nest youth - Xinhua
Han Senhui's exports to China jumped 20 times in 4 years
Last year, South Korea exported more than $100,000 worth of sesame seeds to China, a 20-fold increase from four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in convenience food sales driven by the growing number of empty-nest youth in China, and the increased attention of young people to nutritious meals.
The data was released by the Korea Agro-Aquaculture Food Distribution Corporation (aT) on the 5th.
Last year, South Korea's exports of ginseng to China amounted to US$103.39 million and weighed 218.59 million kilograms, up by 2,094% and 3,668.8% respectively from 2013.
According to the analysis, the increase in sales of Korean ginseng in China is related to the increase in popularity of convenience foods driven by the increase in empty nest youth and the increased attention of young people to nutritious meals.
As of this year, the number of households per capita in China has exceeded 200 million, and it is expected to increase to 30% of the total population in 2020.
In addition, the analysis also said that avian influenza is the biggest factor preventing Shenzhen from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
aT said that from November 2016 to April last year, there was a bird flu epidemic in South Korea, and the relevant authorities completely banned the export of ginseng to China, which led to a sharp decrease in exports.
In 2016, Shenzhen's exports to China amounted to $840,000, which plummeted to $100,000 last year due to avian influenza.

Anhui will further strengthen the reserve resources for enterprise listing, promote the organic integration of Anhui's leading industries, emerging industries and capital markets, actively cultivate listed resources, and play the role of "leader" in leading industrial upgrading and fostering new impetus for economic development.
Chen Xiang said that to promote the transformation and upgrading of Anhui's economy and achieve high-quality development, it is urgent to improve the quality and efficiency of Anhui's listed companies and play a leading role.
It is hoped that this forum will be the starting point for building a co-construction, sharing and sharing platform for the integration of "political science research and financing" to form a strategic alliance around listed companies and an "investment + investment" capital ecosystem.
With 45 listed companies, Yunnan is far ahead of the rest of the province.
In terms of industry distribution, Anhui's listed companies cover 13 industry categories, nearly 70% of which are concentrated in manufacturing, strategic emerging industries, and high-tech industries.

With the continuous deepening of the country's "One Belt, One Road" construction, as one of the most convenient passages connecting China to Southeast Asia, the inbound and outbound flow of river ports has steadily increased.
At 7:30 in the morning, the sun was just beginning to shine, and local people and tourists from China and abroad gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45 a.m., the flag raising ceremony started on time.
After the commander gave the order to raise the flag, the flag-raisers waved their arms to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretched out like a "rooster's wings", accompanied by the strong melody of the national anthem.
"Holding the national flag raising ceremony on every New Year's Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other significant dates not only shows China's image but also inspires the patriotic feelings of people of all ethnic groups in the border areas".
The flag-raising ceremony was attended by the officers and soldiers of the ceremony team.
It is reported that the team responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the river mouth is composed of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various posts at the river mouth border checkpoint, from a three-person flag-raising team to a large-scale ceremony team.
The newly amended Personal Income Tax Law has adjusted the criteria for determining taxpayers who are residents of China for personal income tax from one year to 183 days.
The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation of China said on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to provide preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The person in charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions for the taxation of foreigners. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived in China for more than one year but less than five years, and whose income is derived from outside China, can only pay personal income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
The part of the payment made abroad is not subject to personal income tax in China.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce also issued notices to expand the scope of application of the policy of temporarily exempting foreign investors from advance income tax for direct investment to distribute profits.
The scope of application of the policy of temporary exemption from advance income tax on profits distributed by foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for domestic direct investment has been extended from encouraging foreign investment to all projects and fields not prohibiting foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in reiterated North Korea's "irreversible" decision to denuclearize and said that US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of the year.
The US State Department subsequently said that Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the commitments made at the Singapore summit between the US and North Korean leaders.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK have broken the ice and opened the way for dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the ROK and the US have held meetings, the general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue has been upheld.
First of all, "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed, and the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balancedly resolve the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than pressuring each other and emphasizing our own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the relevant parties are divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the US, the "who will be first" game thinking is still strong.
At the open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the two points of "no change" on the peninsula issue were once again highlighted by various voices on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is achieved.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, on the other hand, emphasized the principle of "action for action", noting that "the weakening of sanctions should go hand in hand with North Korea's gradual steps on the path to denuclearization".
There is no doubt that the relevant parties should continue to fully, completely and accurately implement the DPRK-related resolutions of the Security Council, but pressure is not the goal, the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political solution are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive progress in DPRK-US relations, China believes it is necessary for the Security Council to consider activating the reversible clause in a timely manner, so as to encourage the DPRK and relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, every step forward in the denuclearization and peace process on the Korean Peninsula required sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, all parties concerned should show political perseverance, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficulties, and continue to move in the right direction.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported on the 1st that the Yellow River Waterfall Scenic Area in the county will maintain a relatively high water level and will not have open conditions during the National Day.
To ensure safety, the scenic spot was temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
The Huangpu Waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The Yellow River flows to this point, stone walls stand on both banks, and the mouth of the river is narrow like a mouth, forming the atmosphere of "a thousand miles of Yellow River".
According to the reporter, every year from June to October is the Yellow River flood period, starting from July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the scenic spot of Shanxi Yellow River mouth began to be closed one after another.
Yang Yufeng, chief engineer of the Canggu Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that this is the longest period of high water in the Yellow River in nearly 20 years.
It is understood that in order to welcome the "Eleventh Golden Week", the Yellow River Gorge Waterfall Scenic Area in Shanxi has increased personnel arrangements and vehicle maintenance in advance, and even temporary staff has been hired.
According to the notice of the Yellow River Flood Prevention and Drought Management General Command Office, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces are required to carry out flood prevention work on the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the flow rate of the Yellow River dry river is large, and the flow rate of the upstream river is maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the flow rate of the middle river is maintained at 2500-3500 cubic meters per second, and the flow rate of the downstream river is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.
Health centers and health stations offer flu vaccination services especially during the National Day holiday
The Health Bureau has ordered 150,000 doses of quadrivalent influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year. At this stage, priority is given to free vaccination for high-risk people. In order to facilitate the vaccination of residents during the holidays, the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau provide vaccination services especially during the National Day holiday (October 1 and 2).
In addition to the aforementioned measures for the convenience of the people, since the launch of the program, the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended the flu vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 pm, and 4,158 people have been vaccinated as of 4 pm on September 30, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccination is available to residents of Macau: 6 months to less than 18 years of age, persons aged 50 years and above, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a body mass index of 30 or above), as well as staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macau residents working in gaming establishments.
Meanwhile, other persons, including those in the public sector, who the Health Bureau considers it necessary to vaccinate, will be arranged for vaccination by the Health Center after the Health Bureau takes the initiative to contact the relevant agencies and obtain a list.
In order to facilitate vaccination and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Department of Health will send medical personnel to primary and secondary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Australia from October to December this year to vaccinate infants, primary and secondary school students, teachers and employees.
Students and young children who are unable to participate in the group vaccination can get vaccinated at the vaccination station or health center of Rinpoche General Hospital from December 3, 2018 with their Macao resident ID card, Health Bureau user card, influenza vaccination card (if any), student card, employee card or occupational certificate.
The Department of Health reminds residents that those who received the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine between September 2017 and August 2018 are still required to receive a new seasonal influenza vaccine starting in September 2018 due to the updated influenza antigen composition of the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine, which targets seasonal influenza in the winter of 2018-2019 and the summer of 2019 in the Northern Hemisphere.
The peak of the flu season in Macau generally occurs from January to March each year, which is later than in temperate regions such as northern China and Japan, and the Health Bureau urges the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

Reporters learned from the publicity department of Chengdu Qingbeijiang District Committee on the evening of the 29th: On the evening of September 29th, Beijing time, a train full of car connectors, telescopes, liquid crystal displays and other goods from China to Europe (Chengdu) arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that China-Europe Express has opened a route to the Polish port of Shemianovka, marking China-Europe Express's success in opening another European transport route after Mara and Jop.

More than 400 people have been confirmed dead after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, with many swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the quake.
Authorities expect the total number of deaths on Sunday to rise sharply as new data is reported from remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping mall in the city of Balu.
The quake triggered waves of up to six meters (20 feet) that hit the city of Baru.
So far, only deaths from Balu have been reported, deaths from Ngurah in the north of Balu have been slow to be reported, and authorities are bracing for worse.
The city of Kangra, with a population of 300,000, is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Indonesia's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said the death toll could be in the thousands.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach to celebrate when a huge wave hit the coast at dusk on Friday, sweeping away many and destroying everything in its path.
TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan's large manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, according to the Bank of Japan's short-term quarterly survey released on Monday, as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters hit production and put pressure on companies.
Almost nothing in the survey suggests that the escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war is hitting business prospects and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital expenditure is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion will help push inflation to accelerate toward its 2 percent target, despite signs that businesses are gradually shifting costs to customers.
"In the context of worries about the global trade war, manufacturers' confidence has stagnated due to slowing exports and weak factory production", said Nan Wuji, a senior researcher at the China Agricultural and Forestry Research Institute.
"Confidence is still high... and with corporate profits improving and prices rising, I don't think confidence will continue to fall".
Short-term surveys show that the large manufacturing sector's economic sentiment index fell to positive 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median market estimate is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing sector's economic sentiment index deteriorated for the first time in eight quarters, from a positive 24 in the June survey to a positive 22.
The Reuters poll was positive 22.
According to the survey, both large manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors are expected to remain stable in December.
Investors did not care about the decline in the short-term business sentiment index, the Nikkei.N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday as the continued devaluation of the yen helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short-term outlook highlights robust corporate capital expenditure plans, benefiting from renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to address labour shortages caused by an ageing population.
The central bank's short-term survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
In the last short-term survey, it was 13.6%.
Nanbuchi said that all corporate capital expenditures are expected to grow by 8.5% in the current fiscal year, which is close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
"Given that small businesses have raised their profit forecasts from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but this largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence", he said.
Short-term surveys show that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs has improved, and the output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, the highest in a decade, which is an encouraging sign of progress in Japan's efforts to fight deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises reached negative 23, the tightest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the labor market.
Japan's economy rebounded from its contraction in January-March this year in the second quarter, helped by robust corporate spending.
But escalating trade tensions and disruptions to supply chains during the summer have clouded the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of services imports and exports was 16.4%.
A press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce quoted the head of the Department of Trade and Industry as saying that the total import and export of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan in January-August, growing faster than the overall rate.
Among them, imports and exports of emerging services totaled 1,138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, higher than the overall growth rate of imports and exports of services by 10.4 percentage points, pushing the share of emerging services to increase by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, in January-August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum since the beginning of this year, with export growth exceeding import growth by 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three growth areas are telecommunications, computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade and Industry also pointed out that the proportion of imports of emerging services in January-August also gradually increased.
From January to August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period last year.
Among them, the growth rate of imports of financial services, intellectual property rights fees, telecommunications computers and information services is more than 20%, respectively 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%.

A new round of oil price adjustment window will be opened on September 30 at 24:00, coinciding with the National Day holiday.
Several agencies predict that oil prices will rise sharply, achieving a "triple bottom line".
If you plan to travel by car, fill up your tank before the price goes up.
According to the data calculated by Longxiang Information, the corresponding increase in domestic refined oil is expected to be about 190 yuan / ton; the increase in Zhoushan Information is estimated to be 220 yuan / ton.
In September, the price of oil has been raised twice: on September 3, gasoline was raised by 180 yuan / ton, diesel by 170 yuan / ton; on September 17, gasoline was raised by 145 yuan / ton, diesel by 145 yuan / ton.
Domestic oil prices are linked to international oil prices, and since the current pricing cycle, international oil prices have risen sharply, and Brent crude oil has continued to rise after breaking through the $80 threshold.
As of the close of trading on September 28, US WTI crude oil futures closed at $1.13 and reported $73.25 per barrel.
Brent crude oil futures closed up $1.0 at $82.72/barrel.
"From the perspective of the international situation, tensions such as the US sanctions on Iran, the overall trend of oil prices, and then the OPEC production cut meeting clearly rejected the increase in production, gave confidence to the market, and oil prices rose steadily".
This is not the first time that China's oil industry has been in the spotlight.
On the retail side, the current price of gasoline at No. 92 and No. 95 petrol stations in Beijing is 7.66 yuan per liter and 8.15 yuan per liter, respectively.

"This round of retail prices will be 'three consecutive increases', the combined price increase is about 0.14-0.16 yuan, it is recommended that private car owners fill up before the National Day holiday".
Schoolchildren were punished by their teachers for doing wrong assignments, and the schools involved were stripped of their annual evaluation qualifications.

The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened in Germany
The 69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) opened on October 1 at the Bremen Exhibition Center in Germany with more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Jean-Yves Le Gall, President of the International Astronautical Federation, said that the global space enterprise is no longer limited to a few countries and institutions.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation to jointly promote the development of space.
Zhang Keqin, vice minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China and director of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program at the exchange event and said that China will expand international cooperation in the field of space to contribute to the cause of human space.
Representatives of relevant institutions such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and some private enterprises attended the event to showcase the latest achievements of China's space industry, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and space technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the world's largest aviation event.
The five-day conference is jointly organized by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Center for Applied Technology and Microgravity Research at the University of Bremen, and the International Society of Space Law.
BEIJING, Nov. 5 (Reuters) - The Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade situation remains complicated and severe, with 80.6 percent of companies expecting exports to be better than last year or flat in 2018, according to a press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday.
However, in view of the continuous rise in the cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors, and the external environment affected by the Sino-US trade friction, the exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Jun, deputy secretary-general and spokesperson of the Canton Fair and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of foreign buyers attending the fair and export transactions decreased slightly from the previous year.
There were 189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Exports amounted to 206.494 billion yuan (29.86 billion U.S. dollars), down 1% year on year.
From the market perspective, sales to Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, the BRICS countries, and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, and 2.5% respectively, while sales to traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, and 0.8% respectively.
From the industry point of view, transportation tools, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6% respectively, while textile clothing and home appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Jun said that as a barometer of China's foreign trade, this year's Canton Fair buyer attendance and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development still faces many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the in-depth promotion of supply-side structural reform and the recent introduction of "six stability" and other policy measures at national and local levels, the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is accelerating, and the diversification of enterprise markets continues to make new progress.
"Combining all factors, China's foreign trade imports and exports are expected to maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved".
According to the General Administration of Customs (GAC), China's exports increased by 14.5% and imports by 14.3% year-on-year in September, with a trade surplus of 31.69 billion U.S. dollars.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still exceeded expectations, foreign demand was strong, enterprises grabbed exports before the United States imposed tariffs, and the depreciation of the yuan exchange rate, or the main supporting factors, also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent.
According to a Reuters survey, U.S. fund managers recommended in September to increase cash holdings and continue to maintain a cautious stance as the United States and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs and the dispute shows no signs of abating.
However, according to the 12 fund managers who participated in the survey, North America's asset allocation increased to the highest level since June 2017, while the UK, the euro area and especially emerging markets declined.
Global equity allocations averaged 56.6 percent and bonds 35.5 percent, broadly in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's better to be ready to enter when the market goes down", said a fund manager at a large fund company.
But fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially US stocks, even if US stocks were considered overpriced.
China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale import-themed national-level exhibition, officially opened today in Shanghai, China's open landmark.
An exhibition is like a "window" that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people can see the "opening up of China" to a higher level; through the "window" of the Expo, they can welcome the world and China to "reform and open up again".
"For a country, opening up is like a butterfly breaking into a butterfly, it will experience a moment of pain, but it will be reborn".
General Secretary Xi Jinping summed up the Open Road and gave an important reason for "Why China can".
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to venture into the vast ocean of the world market, has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releasing its internal dynamics and constantly improving its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and meaning of openness with its own tangible achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed expo is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world, a major initiative by China to open its market to the world, and a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization.
And the exhibitors from all over the world have actively registered and exhibited "a hard to find" booth, which is the greatest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider range, broader field and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order is at a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, increasing the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade and adding many uncertainties to the recovering world economy.
In such a context, Huang Pujianghui's event reflects China's defense of free trade, showing the world the open market, sharing China's confidence in the future and China's responsibility.
It's not easy to travel alone, but it's far.
China has opened its heart and embraced the world, not only promoting its own development, but also bringing brilliant "China opportunities" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, initiated the establishment of the Asian Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, and provided a series of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs.
The Expo is such a public product, a great platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their high-quality products and services.
The real beneficiaries, besides the companies, are the domestic consumers.
By building this platform of "preferring the best", it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrades to meet the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As China's door opens wider and wider, the flow of goods and the use of goods will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but is looking to the future, conveying the concept of openness, inclusiveness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win, and forming a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
If the world is good, China will be good; if China is good, the world will be better.
We look forward to the Expo bringing wonderful and fulfilling things to the world; we look forward to a brighter future of a higher level of "Open China" and working with the world to build a community of shared future for mankind.
Foreign media: The United States and Mexico reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes the opening of Canada's dairy market to the United States and a temporary exemption from U.S. tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States and the United States temporarily not imposing tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
On August 27, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement in principle on the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the August 31 deadline set by the United States, extending the negotiation period to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesperson for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said that Canada would only sign favorable agreements, "focusing on substance, not timing.
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters say that presidential candidates do not take women's needs into account.
According to data recently released by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE), more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates consider the needs of women.
Currently, there are 107 million women in Brazil, which would make it the 13th most populous country in the world if all Brazilian women were gathered together to form a nation.
In Brazil, women constitute 52% of the electorate and 48% of the male electorate.
Brazil ranks only 154th out of 193 countries in the world for women's participation in politics, higher than the Arab world.
After more than 20 years of fighting for their rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in obtaining the rights they deserve.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, this phenomenon is the result of the combination of old patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics is supposed to be about citizens claiming citizenship rights, identity, access to public goods, and being part of a society made up of multiple social groups.
A previous study by Locomotiva also found that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel represented by elected politicians, 90% disagree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% disagree with the policies of the current government.
"We need to reverse the under-representation of women in parliament, the political system in Brazil is still affected by inequality and there is still a lot of gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazilian politics", said Natalia Mori.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
Surveys show that 76% of women think they can make a difference in democratic elections and 72% are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less discriminated against.
The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The event was attended by the entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, more than 80 representatives of Chinese news agencies, financial institutions, Chinese-funded enterprises, Chinese companies, Confucius Institutes and international students.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th anniversary of the birth of the new China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to China Zhang Yi said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a grand flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country.
Although you have been abroad for a long time, you always have the great motherland in your heart.
Zhang Yi said that the Chinese nation today is closer than ever to the great goal of achieving national rejuvenation and closer than ever to the center of the world stage.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, difficult and burdensome than ever".
Zhang Yi emphasized that we should not forget our original intention and keep our mission in mind to promote the China-China joint construction of the Belt and Road, go further and deeper, draw a more beautiful joint construction of the Belt and Road and devote all our strength to the development and construction of the motherland and China-China friendly cooperation.
The T2 terminal of Guangxi Zhenjiang International Airport was officially opened on the 30th.
Liu Leihui, secretary of the Guilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the new terminal will be able to meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year after its opening, creating new advantages in Guilin's air traffic, and has great significance for further improving the modern three-dimensional transportation pattern of Guangxi Jiangxi Sea Connectivity, Sea Rail Connectivity, Water and Land Connectivity, and Connecting the "Four Ones".
This year, Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million tourists.
The project to expand the T2 terminal and supporting facilities at Yanjiang International Airport in Guilin is a major public welfare project to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of Guilin as an international tourist attraction.
The project started construction in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square meters and a total investment of 3.258 billion yuan.
On that day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal of Guilin Yangtze International Airport.
The design of the new terminal building is inspired by the underwater world of Guilin Mountain, and the prospect is like a "mountain waterfall crown", similar to the "dragon's back terrace" scenery and the terraced roofs of Zhenbei residential buildings, reflected with Guilin Mountain Water.
It is reported that the new terminal building of Guilin Airport can meet the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people entering and leaving the port every hour, applying "smart airport" technology such as intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, and facial recognition, and planning various business areas such as catering, department stores, duty-free and leisure entertainment.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely disappointing, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
A container ship is docked in New Jersey, USA, September 23, 2018.
However, the US economy is also being closely watched because of the timing of the tax cuts that have helped fuel the current growth.
"As the U.S. returns to full employment, a downturn is inevitable".
The only question, he says, is when it will happen, and in his view, it may be sooner rather than later.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy through the end of the year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make predictions beyond that.
"The current fiscal-policy-induced growth will be unsustainable in the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the economy's growth potential", Barclays economists said in a research note.
"In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing in 2020 will increase", they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly reveal where the major economies are in the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, scheduled for next Monday, will be in focus, followed by the services survey on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be the U.S. nonfarm payrolls to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight labor market is driving strong wage growth.
It is important not only for corporate profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because it can unnerve Federal Reserve Board (FED) officials by boosting wages or causing overall inflation to rise.
"Wages will be closely watched, as they are likely to rise sharply again compared to the previous month".
September's year-on-year increase may not exceed 3%, but we can expect it next month", ING economists wrote in a research report.
European politics could be a source of market volatility next week as holidays in China and other parts of Asia lead to subdued data for the region.
The other EU member states will have to decide quickly whether to strongly object to the Italian government's decision to ignore previous financial commitments to the EU.
With Brexit negotiations entering a critical phase, the Conservative Party's annual conference in Birmingham is likely to spark controversy.
Meanwhile, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to abate as Brazil holds its much-anticipated presidential election next weekend.
[Abstract] After the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the East Sea Branch of the China National Oceanic Administration for use. Chen Yi, director of the Ocean Early Warning and Monitoring Division of the China Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the ship is put into use, which will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large buoy ship, the Xianghong 22, was launched at the China Shipbuilding Group.
When completed, the ship will break the equipment bottleneck in China's large-scale buoys, submersible buoys, recycling, salvage and repair.
The "Shangyang Red 22" is mainly used for the regular inspection and maintenance of buoys/submarines, regular deployment, recovery, emergency deployment, recovery and repair of buoys/submarines, and has the ability to perform comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-sectional surveys.
The new ship is 89 meters long, 18 meters wide, 7.2 meters deep and has a range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Xiaoliang, deputy general manager of WuShip Group, said: "The Xianghong 22 is China's first large-scale buoy operation ship, and the only domestic work ship with a lifting capacity of 10 meters, which will further enhance China's large-scale buoy protection capability".
It is understood that the ship will be delivered to the East Sea Branch of the China National Oceanic Administration after its completion. Chen Xue, Director of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use.
"This ship is also equipped with large-scale buoy placement and maintenance operations, and also has comprehensive marine survey capabilities.
"With a floating survey vessel like this, we have a powerful tool for ocean observation and ocean research in the future".
Qingdao, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Due to the impact of Typhoon Yao Mei, the first day of the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series Qingdao Station "Mazhou Cup", which was scheduled to start on September 30, was postponed to October 1, and a pre-match meeting was held at the Qingdao Ocean Sailing Center before the race.
Affected by the typhoon, the strong wind in the harbor pool continued, the maximum wind speed even reached 24 knots, the starting signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1 pm on the 30th, the wind speed still did not decrease.
A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
"In this case, no one knows when and with what force the wind will blow towards the racing boat", explains Mdlandt.
"It's the closest stadium to the city, and with the current winds, it's the wisest decision to cancel the race".
There is still some disappointment for the crew, who are ready for anything.
"The boat is ready to dock and we are in good shape".
"But I know it's the right thing to do, and hopefully the wind will be less today and we'll be able to do our best", said Qingdao's Max Richardson.
Omega Wilkinson, hailed as the "star of hope" for New Zealand at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "Losing a day makes the games more interesting".
Today's match will be more intense and there are only two days left to play.
I'm sure you'll be especially desperate".
Despite the strong winds, Pierre-Yves Durand, rower of the French ABM team, appealed at the pre-match meeting about his warm relationship with the host city of Qingdao: Five years ago, he accidentally injured himself in the International Extreme Sailing Series and broke a muscle.
The International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is part of the World Sailing League along with Volvo, America's Cup and the World Sailing Challenge Tour.
The Qingdao race will be sailed by the Flying Phantom.
2018 is the eighth year that the event has landed in Qingdao, the "Sailing Capital".
Despite the ongoing turmoil in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of foreign exchange funds fell by 97% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but was better than the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose sharply and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, foreign exchange funds recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, significantly lower than HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
At the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes rose against the US stock indexes, until the end of September and early October, after the US stock market index peaked, the market sentiment began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States.
"A change in market sentiment is a good thing, if the trade war only has a one-sided impact, it will not help much to solve things".
However, he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise".
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's equity investment loss in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% from the previous quarter to HK$4.7 billion, while the overseas equity investment income increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion; the foreign exchange loss of HK$16.2 billion and the bond income of HK$9.7 billion decreased by 24% and 31% respectively.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support the port.
The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the US dollar since 1983.
Regarding Hong Kong's current financial situation, Chen said that uncertainty in the economy and asset markets has increased, and downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable, defensive, and resilient.
"Hong Kong has a strong international investment position, with net external assets of US$1.4 trillion, equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan, which is more than enough to cope with economic downturns or reversals".
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar continued to fall and the gap with the US dollar widened. Chen pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar had risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21, and the market generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar.
However, he believes that the situation of the HKD rate being lower than the US dollar rate in the future will change as the HKD rate normalizes and the Hong Kong bank rate hike cycle begins.
"HKD interest rates will be more aligned with USD interest rates, and we must manage risks more carefully and be prepared to deal with market fluctuations".
The three-month rate fell 0.9 percent to 2.08179 percent on Monday, widening the spread from 46 basis points to 51 basis points against the US dollar. The one-month rate reached a five-month low, widening the spread from 120 basis points to 127 basis points against the US dollar.
From mid-May to mid-September, the HKD spot rate hovered near 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the period.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of part of the proceeds from the hedging activities and the completion of the large-scale IPO activities, the weak swap guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after the first time in April.
The HKMA buys the Hong Kong dollar at the rate of 7.85 and sells the US dollar at the rate of 7.85 to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the HKMA bought about HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law offer any benefits to foreigners?
In response to a reporter's question on the 30th, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong and Macao people.
Reporters asked if the newly amended personal income tax law will adjust the criteria for determining the taxpayers of personal income tax residents in China from one year to 183 days.
Will there be any preferential treatment for overseas residents, including Hong Kong and Macao residents, when the law is implemented?
The person in charge responded that the current regulations on the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions for the taxation of foreigners. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived in China for more than one year but less than five years, and whose income is derived from outside China, can only pay personal income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing the preferential arrangements for overseas residents, including Hong Kong and Macao residents.
There is no "threshold" for the monthly center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the push of the "two-child economy" and the boom of the mother-child market, all kinds of monthly clubs have sprung up from the north to the third and fourth tier cities.
Currently, the popular monthly meeting meets the consumption needs of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but it is also in an embarrassing situation.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 national "Quality Month" series of activities, and reporters visited a five-star monthly center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of mother and baby care services.
In general, the center provides newborn care, nutritious meals, and postpartum plastic surgery.
In the newborn center, the reporter saw nurses checking the newborn's breastfeeding status every day, and professional caregivers providing newborns with delicate care services such as bathing and touching.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, we provide services such as wound care at the beginning of the month and beauty care in the middle and late months of the month.
One of the new mothers told reporters that she booked the place eight months in advance.
Some small-scale monthly clubs can only provide some simple monthly services, and there are problems such as non-standard disinfection, easy cross-infection, and unscientific diet.
Of all the five-star lunar centers in Tianjin, they are the only one with a B-Class service certification, said the center's director.
"Although some customers do not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is of great significance for the long-term development of enterprises to benefit customers by forcing enterprises to strictly standardize process management through certification", he said.
Pan Lifeng, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Division of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and service characteristics, and is an important part of the national quality infrastructure.
Starting from 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a gradual development process from scratch, and a number of influential service certifications such as financial service certification, maternal and child care service certification, after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, and health service certification have emerged.
According to the statistics of the State Administration for Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification agencies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifeng said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce and other fields, and promote the reform and quality improvement of the supply side of the service industry.
HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices fell for the second consecutive month after hitting their peak, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) governor Chen Deqing said on Monday.
Chen also pointed out that if real estate prices were to recover, the first to be affected would be those who owned their homes at the peak of the real estate market, but it is expected that there will be a sharp decline in real estate prices such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
At a briefing in the Legislative Yuan, Chen led a group of senior officials from the MGA and said that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, measures can be eased gradually when appropriate.
"But we are only looking at a few weeks of data, it is too early to relax, it will take more time to see if the housing market enters a downward cycle".
Since 2009-10, the CBRC has introduced eight rounds of countercyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages on various types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to improve bank risk management and resilience.
As Hong Kong officially enters the rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong Private Residential Property Price Index (PRPI) declined for two consecutive months in August and September, extending the monthly decline to 1.44% in September.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year is still 10.2%.
Measuring Hong Kong's resilience to financial risks, household finances remain healthy, according to the HKMA. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of Hong Kong households living in their own homes without a mortgage reached 66%, higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11.
However, Chen said that high seismic resistance does not mean that people who already have houses will not be affected by the economic downturn, because property values will fall, and people who buy buildings at the peak will be the first to bear the brunt.
While the FMA is tightening lending by banks to mortgage lenders, homeowners can also obtain high-interest mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Currently, together with mortgage loans provided to developers, borrowers have a mortgage success rate of 85-90%, and if house prices fall by 10%, there will be negative assets (i.e. the property market value falls below the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Zhao Guoheng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the proportion of mortgages with a high percentage provided by developers is only 2-2.5% of the total number of bank mortgages, which is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the property owners.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.
BEIJING, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce retail export enterprises have ushered in another wave of tax benefits on Oct. 1, involving VAT and excise tax exemptions.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs have recently jointly issued a decree to exempt e-commerce export enterprises in the cross-border e-commerce integrated pilot zone from VAT and excise duty on goods that have not obtained a valid import certificate and meet the following conditions.
First, e-commerce export enterprises are registered in the pilot zone and register the date of export, name of goods, unit of measurement, quantity, unit price and amount on the cross-border e-commerce online integrated service platform at the place of registration.
Secondly, electronic commerce export declaration procedures for export goods will be handled through the customs at the location of the pilot zone.
Thirdly, the exported goods do not belong to the goods for which the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation have explicitly canceled the export refund (exemption) according to the decision of the State Council.
It is clarified that the General Administration of Customs regularly transmits the electronic information of the e-commerce export goods declaration list to the State Administration of Taxation.
The tax authorities of the comprehensive zones shall strengthen the tax-free management of export goods based on the electronic information of the export goods declaration list classified by the State Administration of Taxation.
According to the notice, the specific tax exemption management measures will be formulated by the provincial taxation departments and the commercial finance and commerce departments.
The offices of the leading groups for the construction of comprehensive pilot zones and the competent departments of commerce should coordinate and promote communication and collaboration among departments and the implementation of relevant policies, accelerate the establishment of a monitoring system for e-commerce export statistics, and promote the healthy and rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
A man in Liaoning province killed and dumped his lover after a disagreement over money and then fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On the 5th, the reporter learned from the Dongsheng District Public Security Bureau in the city of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, that after a joint investigation by the two police forces, the man was successfully caught.
On June 26, 2018, a woman went missing in Busan, Liaoning province, and her family called the local police.
After the police investigation, it was determined that this was not a simple case of missing persons. The missing person, Bai Mu, was most likely killed by his lover, Wang Mu.
On October 30, the task force found that the suspect Wang may be hiding in Dongsheng District, Purdue City. Dongsheng Police immediately organized the police to fully cooperate with Liaoning Police to investigate the case.
After five days of investigation, the police finally found Wang's whereabouts and thoroughly investigated those involved.
On November 4th, the two police forces joined forces to arrest the suspect Wang in an excavator accessories store in Dongcheng District.
According to Wang, he and the victim, Bai, were lovers, and because Bai's sister had a large amount of money in her name, the two decided to take the money for themselves.
On June 22, 2018, Wang Mu and Bai Mu had a disagreement over the control of the money, and Wang Mu killed Bai Mu in a rented house, dismembered the body and dumped it.
At present, the suspect Wang has been handed over to Liaoning Provincial Police.
The "Green Development in Action" theme train of the "Five Major Developments and Beautiful Anhui" has been launched
The second theme train of the "Five Major Developments, Beautiful Anhui" - "Green Development in Action" theme train was officially put into operation on the 5th.
In order to comprehensively demonstrate the brilliant achievements of the "Five Major Developments and Beautiful Anhui" construction work, Hefei City Railways and Jinbin Media Technology Co. jointly designed and produced the "Five Major Developments and Beautiful Anhui" series theme trains.
The first train, the "Innovation and Development in Action" train, was officially put into operation on October 1 on Line 1 of Hefei City Rail Transit.
The theme of the train is blue-green, symbolizing the mountain water, which represents the birth, vitality and purity.
The promotional content focuses on the core idea of "Five Major Development and Beautiful Anhui" and the 18 representative green development achievements of the province, including the construction and development results of green development key projects such as the Yangtze River Canal Project, the forestry system, the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the Ten Million Tons of Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the three theme trains "Coordinated Development in Action", "Open Development in Action" and "Shared Development in Action" will also be launched in the near future.
October 1 is the first day of the "Golden Week" of the National Day of the Mainland, and also the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong, many mainland residents take advantage of the holiday to travel and shop abroad, and many Hong Kong residents return to Shenzhen on the same day.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection Headquarters, as of 16:00 on the same day, the number of people entering and leaving Shenzhen port reached more than 429,000, and the number of transportation vehicles reached more than 16,800 (boats, racks, columns).
It is understood that due to many favorable factors such as the increase in countries that provide visa-free exit policies for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists who use the National Day holiday to go to Europe and Southeast Asia and other countries for holiday shopping continues to increase.
On the morning of the first day, passenger traffic peaked at Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huangpu, Fukuda and other ports. Passenger traffic peaked at Luohu from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, and passenger traffic peaked at Shenzhen Bay from 6:30 am to 13:00 noon.
It is reported that in order to cope with the peak flow of inbound and outbound passengers (vehicles), the Shenzhen Border Inspection Headquarters, in accordance with the unified deployment of the National Immigration Administration, started the peak flow of passengers (vehicles) service mode, arranged overtime police to support the duty line, opened the checkpoint in advance, guided passengers and vehicles to wait in an orderly manner, ensured that Chinese citizens queued for inbound and outbound customs clearance for no more than 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of foreigners.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Headquarters reminds incoming and outgoing passengers to pay attention to documents and visas before leaving, the validity period of the visa, reasonable travel arrangements, avoid peak travel times as much as possible, choose the right time, and travel to the right port.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangdong-Shenzhen high-speed railway must hold valid entry and exit documents and visa stamps. The high-speed railway ticket is only a passenger certificate and cannot be used as an entry and exit document.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that affects multiple organs throughout the body.
It cannot be eradicated due to its unknown mechanism, difficult diagnosis and lack of effective treatment methods.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at Tsinghua University's School of Life Sciences, and Qi Zhiguo, director of the Center for Rheumatic Immunity at Peking University People's Hospital, discovered a molecular variant of human immunoglobulin that increases susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus and is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaoxiao, one of the authors of the article, the team collected a large sample of nearly 2,000 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and found that patients with immunoglobulin mutations produced a wide variety of pathogenic cells and autoantibodies, and significantly increased the incidence and severity of inflammation such as pancreatitis, arthritis, meningitis, and vasculitis.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracking, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli's team discovered the immune signaling pathway activated by this immune molecule variant, which promotes the pathogenic mechanism of B cells to secrete various autoantibodies.
Reporters learned that the two teams have joined forces to give full play to their respective advantages and achieve a close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team focuses on B lymphocyte immuno-recognition and immune activation research, while the Xuzhou team has been engaged in long-term clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of collaboration between the two teams, and the first time in the academic community to recognize the mechanism by which immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy".
This is not short-sightedness, this is law-abiding.
Lawyers carrying axes to court?
The news was indeed sensational and caused an uproar in legal circles.
The Fujian Quanzhou Municipal People's Court subsequently fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou Municipal Lawyers Association investigate the matter.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou City Bar Association recently issued an official notice saying that the two lawyers' actions did not involve violations of the law and would not be punished according to the law.
According to various reports, the Quanzhou City Bar Association's handling of the case was not short-sighted or confrontational, but was approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court.
The incident, which could have caused tension within the legal community, was resolved properly.
The reversal of events is due to a more complete reconstruction of the truth: the ax carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it is not sharpened, it is only used as an auxiliary evidence in the proof of evidence, and there is no intimidation or subjective intention to "endanger the security of the court".
There are four very important details that need to be considered to determine whether the lawyer's actions violated the law or not: First, the local court had only shown photos of the axe in two previous hearings, and from the defense point of view, it was necessary to show the original axe. Second, the axe was purchased one hour before the hearing, and it was not that the lawyer did not want to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge.
Taken together, it can be seen that the lawyers involved in the case "took an axe to court" to defend themselves.
After clarifying all the facts, the Quanzhou City Bar Association did not give in to the pressure and decided not to punish him.
This decision will stand the test of facts and law.
As for bringing an ax to court as a regulatory tool without the court's permission, it is indeed easy to cause unrest and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and prudence, the previous fine imposed by the Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court and the judicial recommendation are also justified.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent lawyers from being harassed by individual courts, the Supreme People's Court issued the Rules for the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Courts in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to undergo personal security checks when appearing in court.
Since the rule was issued, lawyers have followed suit, and there have been few incidents of security breaches jeopardizing court security.
In very isolated cases like Quanzhou, misunderstandings can be easily eliminated as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulating organization of the legal profession, has the dual mission of punishing wrongdoing and safeguarding the law.
In the past, individual bar associations have been criticized for focusing on punishment rather than protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Bar Association, both in terms of the process and the result, is commendable and sets an example for more law firms to perform their duties properly.
What are the tax benefits that will hit our pockets from October 1?
SHANGHAI, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. In order to allow the general public to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1, the taxpayer's actual salary income will be deducted at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the New Deal in place, what are the benefits for the pockets of the masses?
Benefits: Significant reduction in income tax on wages
Taxpayers who receive salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan per month and apply the new tax rate schedule.
According to the table of tax reduction for different income groups, people with a monthly income of 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan after deducting "three insurance and one gold", should pay 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1,590 yuan, and 9,090 yuan after tax reform.
It is worth noting that due to the holiday, the new basic deduction fee and tax rate table can be applied to the wages that should have been issued in October by the end of September.
For this purpose, the withholding client software used by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax must still be declared and paid within the statutory declaration period.
Benefit #2: Lower tax bracket significantly widened
In addition to the increase in the starting point, a new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
The seven tax brackets for wages and salaries are the same as before and have not changed, but the tax bracket has changed significantly. The three low tax brackets of 3%, 10% and 20% have expanded significantly, the 25% tax bracket has narrowed, and the three higher tax brackets of 30%, 35% and 45% have remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusted the tax rates for production and business income, including raising the lower limit of the top 35% tax rate from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual entrepreneurs and sole proprietorships will benefit from the tax reform.
"From the previous assessment of the personal tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the benefits of the personal tax reform, especially the tax reduction for low- and middle-income people".
According to Lan Ming, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation.
Benefit #3: Easier and more efficient tax services
Since the announcement of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Department has launched a series of comprehensive and extensive tax information campaigns.
On the one hand, "one-to-one, point-to-point" policy counseling for key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Pudong New Area Taxation Bureau visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd. and Red Star Meilong Household Group Co., Ltd., which have a large number of employees, large workload, large amount of tax payments, and the tax department proactively advised and answered questions.
On the other hand, the tax policy of "all-round, multi-dimensional and three-dimensional" taxation should be promoted to the general public.
Use the official website of Shanghai Taxation, WeChat public number, Weibo and other channels to promote policy hotspots in a timely manner to ensure that policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, since September 28, the Shanghai Taxation WeChat public number 12366 intelligent consultation platform has been launched to carry out "target-oriented" intelligent integrated individual tax reform publicity services through "artificial + intelligent" tax service consultation.
On the evening of November 5th, Beijing time, the official website of the English Football Association officially announced that former England captain Rooney will return to the England national team to play in the warm-up match against the United States on November 15th.
In August last year, Rooney announced his retirement from the England national team.
Rooney has scored 53 goals in 119 appearances for England, making him the team's all-time leading scorer and second most-capped player.
According to the official FA website, the match against the United States was to raise money for Rooney's children's charity foundation, and Rooney himself was very excited: "It's great to play for England again at Wembley, thank you Southgate and FA for inviting me to help my foundation.
"Playing for England is the greatest honour of my career and it will be a special memory for me to play my 120th and final game for England".
The annual Yangcheng Lakefront Cultural Tourism Festival kicked off on the 30th. According to Gu Wenhua, Party Secretary of Ba Township, the town's dam economy currently has an annual output value of nearly 3.8 billion yuan and a net income of over 600 million yuan.
Yangqing Lake Dam, also known as Golden Java Dam, is known as the "King of Dam" because of its mud-free body, commonly known as clear water dam, frog white belly, and flesh paste.
It has become a customary practice for people to eat tangerine during the Golden Autumn Festival.
He is one of the most recognizable faces in the city.
It's a great way to get a taste of what it's like to be in Jiangnan.
Liu Yongjinwei introduced that this year more diners will spend more time staying in Ba City, watching white shark hunting, watching the sunset, experiencing the joy of catching shrimp, and enjoying the slow-paced life of the water village.
Due to the widespread introduction of large-sized seedlings in Pak towns, this year's chicken heads are much larger than before.
Chang Jianhua, a rice farmer who has been working with rice for nearly 20 years, is planning to export rice seedlings and cultivation techniques from Yangcheng Lake rice to Thailand, so that local cuisine crosses national borders and promotes cultural exchanges with overseas cuisine.
"Kwek Town" is a cultural landmark in the city.
At present, there are five major soup markets and a street of cuisine in Ba City, namely soup kitchens, fishermen's lanterns, spring and autumn water city, Linhu town, Zheng Yiba market, and a street of cuisine. As many as 1,300 large and small hotels have been built around Yangqing Lake.
According to Guo Wenhua, "One Eagle" attracts nearly 3 million domestic and foreign tourists every year, and also forms the old streets of the city of Ba with lively colors and fragrances.
Many tourist products such as Kunqu-themed post office, pick-up concept book bar, powdered baby-themed image gallery, Kunqu-themed accommodation, embroidery gallery, flag hall and many other tourist products have been launched one after another, Kunqu scholar Yang Guoqiang, flute master Chen Dongbao, famous Kunqu student Guolin, bamboo carving craftsman Liu Xiaozhou, folk song heir Lu Zhenlian and a group of famous studios have settled in, and the old street has become the core of the cultural district of "Kunqu town".
It is reported that during the festival, the 4th Chongyang Music Festival will be held in Ba Town, Quezon City, bringing together musicians from all over the world.
A number of cultural venues such as the historical and cultural exhibition center in Baoding, the Kunqu Promenade, the Aoyama Shrine, the Chong Literature Library, and the Kunqu Grand Theater will also be unveiled, presenting the cultural charm of the hometown of Kunqu, the hometown of Chinese calligraphy, and the hometown of Jiangnan fish.
The US-Mexico trilateral trade agreement will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer published on the Canadian government's website said that the United States, Canada and Mexico have reached a trilateral trade agreement, which will be known as the USMCA.
Earlier, Canadian CTV News quoted a senior US source as saying that Canada and the United States had overcome their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two sources familiar with the situation, reported that the September 30 agreement between the United States and Canada will keep the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a trilateral trade agreement, and the leaders of the three countries will sign a new agreement within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico agreed to a new trade agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will provide a high-standard trade agreement for our workers, farmers, and companies that will lead to freer markets, fairer trade, and more sustainable economic growth.
The current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After taking office, President Trump announced plans to review the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries started the negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the Okinawa gubernatorial election, which was held early due to the death of former governor Hiroshi Nagamasa, were announced in the early hours of the morning of the 1st, and Yushin Dani, who opposed the relocation of the US military base in Japan, was elected.
The votes were counted on September 30, and the final results showed that Yuichi received 396,632 votes, the most votes in the history of Okinawa's prefectural governorship election, and more than 80,000 more votes than his main rival, Saori Shimizu.
A total of four candidates ran in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, 0.89 percentage points lower than the 2014 Okinawa gubernatorial election.
Yucheng told the media on the 1st that the election results show that the county residents do not want the efforts of the governor to be in vain, and he will continue to work with the Japanese government and the US government to oppose the US military base relocation plan and the closure of the Futenma base.
The U.S. military base in Futenma, located in the city of Iino Bay, Okinawa Prefecture, has long been plagued by rumors that the U.S. and Japanese governments have agreed to relocate it to the Futenma area of Nagoya, but the people of Okinawa strongly oppose it.
Regarding the relocation plan strongly opposed by the countrymen and the request to revoke the land reclamation license along the coast of Yancheng, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and division with the central government from the beginning, and hoped that the two sides would fully exchange views, showing the intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 1st that he took the result seriously and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on the 1st that the government's policy on moving the US military base as soon as possible has not changed.
He also expressed his willingness to hold talks with Seoul.
He will be officially inaugurated as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on January 4.
Since the mid-2000s, North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has been growing more soybeans on his land as China's demand for soybeans has grown.
This shift culminated this year when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres of land, an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many other farmers like him plan to plant corn and wheat, the staple crops of America's farmland, in 2019.
U.S. farmers planted more soybeans than corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to switch to other food crops comes as U.S. farmers struggle to sell soybeans amid President Donald Trump's trade war with China.
China, which normally buys about 60 percent of U.S. soybean exports, has bought almost none in recent months because of the trade war, causing soybean prices to fall to a decade low.
Thomas plans to plant more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing his dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demand.
Thomas said the price of soybeans "has hit us hard".
He said that without Chinese buyers, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover costs is $8.50.
U.S. farmers planted a record amount of soybeans this year and are expected to harvest a record amount.
It is at such a vulnerable time that they have been hit by the trade war.
China imposed import tariffs on US soybeans in July in response to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first forecast of planted acreage next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
The forecast is expected to confirm the private sector's expectations of a decrease in soybean planting area.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics forecast on October 19 that corn plantings will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, while soybean plantings will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also forecasts a 4% increase in U.S. wheat acreage.
The area of soybeans planted before the retaliatory tariffs went into effect rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres more than a decade ago.
Corn plantings have increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and wheat plantings are at 47.8 million acres this year, near the lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, has a total of 3,600 acres under cultivation, nearly half of which he used to grow soybeans this year, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said he could increase the area under corn by up to 20 percent on his farm in northern Illinois, the nation's largest soybean-growing state.
Soybeans have a lower yield per acre than corn, but also require less fertilizer, which makes soybean farming less expensive overall.
If farmers switch to end-value corn, it may increase costs but will benefit some businesses, including fertilizer seller Anderson's Inc.
Pat Bowe, CEO of Andersons, told Reuters that he expects GM corn to be better for fertilizer use.
Bayer also expects to benefit from farmers planting more corn.
Director-General of Bangkok's Gangnam Airport Authority Suthirawa apologized for the incident of a Chinese citizen being beaten at the airport and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists, and relevant departments will strengthen management and improve service awareness to avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, a Chinese man who was denied entry to Hong Kong was physically confronted by security guards at Hong Kong International Airport on the 27th.
Suthilawa said that the security guard in question had committed a serious breach of discipline and that the airport authority had suspended him and set up a committee of inquiry to investigate the matter in accordance with procedure.
Thailand's Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to be flown back to China.
Suthilawa apologized for the incident that damaged Thailand's image and said that Thailand attaches great importance to the incident and is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists who were beaten.
He said that the airport is willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand and has set up special entry points for Chinese tourists at five major international airports in Bangkok, Suvarnabhumi, Gorman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hoi An.
He said that in the next step, the airport authority will make adjustments to the landing check-in area, clarify the landing check-in fee, and improve the quality of service and communication skills of staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand heard about the incident, it immediately contacted the parties to find out what happened.
At the same time, the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority, and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports requested the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators.
Xinhua International Review: Defending multilateralism, China knows how to act in unity
At a time when the tide of unilateralism is surging, international rules and the multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the intersection of unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China will work with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
Faced with the new situation and new challenges, China has voiced a strong voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, be based on rules and order, be based on fairness and justice, and be guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for building a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations at the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as a complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.
China's thinking and voice reflects the mainstream voice of the international community.
As stated by the President of the 73rd General Assembly, Espinosa, in the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold the rules-based international system more than ever".
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political balance of power, some emerging markets and developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new impetus for the development of multilateralism in the face of headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China's advocacy of building a big family instead of piecing together small circles, adhering to the concept of multilateralism such as joint consultation and joint construction instead of winner-take-all, conforming to the trend of the times, is the inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve the world's problems.
I'm not saying that I don't believe that there is a need for change, but I don't think it's possible.
China's Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
The international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the 16+1 Cooperation initiated by China promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation and contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions on the multilateral stage of the United Nations have become more and more powerful.
Addressing international hotspots, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, reducing poverty and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
At a time when the world is facing a growing "trust deficit", when populism and polarization are on the rise, the world needs multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands, turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The first national standard 4K demonstration area in Guangdong was unveiled on September 30 in the garden area of Haizhu District, Guangzhou City. On the same day, the Guangdong Radio Network officially launched 4K service throughout the province.
The event was co-sponsored by Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Co., Ltd. and the Leadership Group for Co-Building Co-Governance and Shared Social Governance in Daxing District, Haizhu District.
According to the deployment of the Guangdong provincial government, Guangdong Radio Network actively implemented the New Digital Home 4K Action Plan. In December 2017, it released the country's first digital home gateway terminal product supporting IPv6 and the country's first digital home gateway terminal product supporting 4 way real 4K concurrency - "U point home server" (with AVS2 standard 4K box, VoIP voice remote control).
In 2018, Guangdong Radio Network launched a series of radio beneficiary initiatives and launched the "Radio 4K Service Month" to comprehensively promote the "U Point Home Server" throughout the province.
On the day of the event, Guangdong Radio Network officially launched 4K service throughout the province, and the first 4K smart TV safe home sharing platform project based on 4K application was also officially unveiled and launched. The platform was jointly created by Guangdong Cable and the office of the Leadership Group for Social Governance and Shared Social Governance in Daxing District of Haizhu District.
Chen Xiaohui, chief engineer of the Guangdong Provincial News Publishing and Radio Bureau, said at the event that this event is an initiative of the radio network enterprises to serve the work of the Party Central Committee and the government. The government actively uses "Internet Plus" to build a "digital government" to serve the people.
The ceremony showcased and popularized the 4K Smart TV Safe Home Sharing Platform, a new digital home application with 4K TV at its core.
The first phase of the "4K Smart TV Safe Home Sharing Platform" will have four major modules: "Guangzhou Neighborhood", "New Guangzhou People's Home", "Smart Community" and "Smart Family", focusing on exploring the construction of smart neighborhoods.
It is reported that the Guangdong Radio Network has opened five sets of 4K live broadcast channels, and on the National Day, the 4K Ultra High Definition channel of the Central Radio and Television Station will be exclusively broadcast throughout the province.
This post is part of our special coverage Martyrs' Day 2011.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, Xi Jinping's Equality Party and national leaders attended a wreath-laying ceremony to pay tribute to the people's heroes and commemorate the heroes and martyrs, together with representatives from all walks of life in the capital.
This is the first Martyr's Day after the implementation of the Law on the Protection of Heroic Martyrs.
Five years ago, the Martyrs' Memorial Day was established on the eve of the National Day to show the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has profoundly pointed out that "to abandon tradition is to cut off one's spiritual lifeline".
"If you don't forget the past, you can open the future".
We revere the heroes and commemorate the martyrs, that is, we must always remember history, carry on the heroic spirit, and concentrate the powerful positive energy of national revival.
The commentary points out that Yingluck is the backbone of the nation.
Honoring the martyrs and paying homage to them is to make them a noble, holy and powerful eternal memory in our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs sacrificed their lives for national independence, people's liberation and the country's prosperity and people's happiness.
Every veteran who sacrificed for the country will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty to the country will be looked up to.
Establishing a national memorial day for them and organizing various forms of commemorative activities is precisely to pay tribute to them in the name of the country, deeply remember their meritorious achievements, and learn to inherit their precious spirit of love for the motherland, loyalty to the people, selfless dedication, and courage to sacrifice.
Party committees and governments at all levels have improved the preferential pension system and continuously raised the level of pension, and the party and the state have practiced respect for heroes with practical actions.
Every year, countless people visit the Martyrs' Mausoleum, allowing us to feel the deep feelings of remembrance of the masses and the revitalizing power of the national blood.
Hero worship, hero defence, hero learning and hero love have become commonplace throughout society.
Today, as socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, we can console the heroes who are sleeping in the ground: a strong China is rising in the east, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is becoming a reality in our hands.
Let's move forward with a strong spirit and strive towards a great goal!

The fifth "Disability Voices Month" focuses on the issue of sex education for youth with disabilities
In recent years, the topic of sex education for adolescents in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges for sex education for adolescents with disabilities remain daunting.
A seminar on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate children and youth with disabilities about sex is an important topic of the seminar.
A report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of children and youth with disabilities in China, released at the meeting, shows that children with disabilities suffer from sexual harassment and sexual assault at a higher rate than healthy children.
There is also a greater focus on "sexual protection" for children and adolescents with disabilities.
The purpose of this seminar is to promote comprehensive sex education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from three aspects: family support, school education, and institutional services.
Experts believe that the public awareness of disabled people in China has remained at an insufficient level.
Influenced by traditional concepts and other factors, comprehensive education for people with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, has not gone far enough in China.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare organizations, there has been a welcome development in the practice and implementation of sexual and reproductive health education for the full development of people with disabilities in China.
The report shows that children and young people with visual impairments, hearing impairments, intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities, although they have more difficulties than ordinary people in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships, have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
The "Symposium on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sexuality Education for Persons with Disabilities" was hosted by the Shanghai People's Welfare Foundation and co-sponsored by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Beijing Representative Office, and the UNFPA Representative Office in China. It aimed to explore the practice and implementation of sexual and reproductive health education for the full development of persons with disabilities in the context of the Healthy China Grand Strategy.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday released data on net short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that as of the end of August, the central bank's short position in foreign currency futures and forward contracts was zero for 12 consecutive months.
The central bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $6.044 billion in short positions in foreign currency futures contracts and futures contracts, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the size of the short position measured in SDR (special drawing rights) was SDR 4.276 billion.
Since then, the central bank's forward short position in foreign exchange has been zero.
The central bank first published the data at the end of March 2016; the data shows that at the end of February 2016, the central bank's long position in foreign currency forwards and futures contracts was $2.438 billion and short position was $28.9 billion.
In the September data released at the end of October of the same year, the net short position increased by $164.01 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
The central bank has previously stated that the long-term and futures short position in foreign currency against the local currency mainly reflects the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of corporate foreign currency liabilities.
On the evening of September 20 this year, K158 train took Jo, a third-year student in Zhengzhou, to Weibo.
A woman on a train bought a ticket without a seat and took her seat: "Tap, tap, tap".
After a two-hour ride, the train conductor advised him that an hour would be useless.
Eventually, a male passenger in the same car couldn't bear to look down and lifted the dam.
From a lyrical point of view, although the end result is mostly that the perpetrators are condemned by the public, punished administratively by the public security department, and even put on the integrity blacklist, the public still feels "unforgiven": Why can't the perpetrators be punished on the spot?
Why not stop their immoral and even illegal behavior on the spot and punish them afterwards?
And as for the irrationality of the "Crocodile" building, why was it only a male passenger who "didn't see the way" to pick it up?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger police, and short-distance trains are generally not.
The repeated occurrence of the Zodiac incident has made people realize that the Zodiac must be forcibly removed or even punished in order to have a deterrent effect.
This requires that our train passenger police should dare to take strong measures in time, and that trains without passenger police should be equipped with passenger police as soon as possible to ensure timely stopping and combating illegal activities.
On October 1st, the first day of the National Day holiday, a surge of vehicles headed for Songpan in Mao County passed through Sichuan's Beichuan County.
At about 1:00 p.m., the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan and needed to be urgently sent to Shangyang for treatment due to limited medical conditions.
On the occasion of the implementation of one-way traffic control on the lake ring road in Tangjiagang, Hokkaido, I would like to ask the traffic police to release 120 ambulances.
After receiving the call for help, the on-duty police quickly reported the situation to the battalion, and after Captain Huang Zhimin briefly understood the situation, he immediately arranged for the police at the control point to contact the person seeking help and asked them to do their best to escort the work.
"More than a thousand vehicles entered the controlled area at the time, and after contacting 120 ambulances, we immediately arranged for deployment".
In order to prevent vehicles that have entered this section of the road from driving in parallel, the traffic police implemented segmental control of vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour in advance and reminded all passing drivers to give way to the side of the road for the ambulance.
Subsequently, the Civilian Police of the Drum Squad also temporarily stopped vehicles from entering the controlled area, allowing 120 ambulances to arrive.
At around 3 p.m., a Kagawa U-license ambulance drove into the territory of Beichuan, and the Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to open the road.
It is understood that only one vehicle can pass through some places on the Ring Road, and the civil police carried out temporary control of these places in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 ambulances.
When arriving at the village of Ten Mile Monument, there was a road that could not be missed, so the traffic police contacted the two village committees in advance, borrowed the village road and prohibited social vehicles from entering the village.
"It took only 40 minutes for 120 ambulances from the Beichuan traffic police to reach the provincial road 302".
Yang said that under normal circumstances, the entire transit time would take four hours.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for patients".
It is reported that at 17:20 the critically ill patients were rushed to Shangyang for treatment.
The confirmed death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has rapidly risen to 832, and authorities fear it could rise further as rescue workers struggle to reach remote areas cut off from communication.
Of particular concern is Kangra, an area north of Balu with a population of 300,000 and close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Two other areas have been cut off from the outside world since Friday.
"We have not yet received reports from the other three areas".
Communication and electricity are still cut off.
Nugroho said five foreigners were among the missing, including three French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
Indonesia's vice-president said the death toll could rise into the thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo inspected the affected areas and appealed for patience.
Reuters November 4 - British Brexit minister Dominic Raab has privately demanded Britain's right to leave the "backstop" arrangement for the Irish border in three months, the Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday.
Raab reportedly made the request to Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney during a private meeting in London on Tuesday.
The request was "clearly at odds" with remarks made by David Lidington, the Home Secretary, during a visit to Dublin three days later.
The UK's Department for Exiting the European Union said it would not comment on the private meeting.
At 8:05 a.m. yesterday, two suspected pickpockets were caught stealing from a bus on Route 20 from Yongdingmen Station to Zhuji Station.
Two thieves cut open the passenger's coat pocket and stole 800 yuan in cash.
This is the first theft case solved by Beijing police during the National Day.
Yesterday morning, after 5 am, the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Team's counterintelligence investigators arrived at the designated location.
According to previous experience, the focus of their work is on crowded places, public transportation hubs, public transportation subway lines, including Tiananmen Square to watch the flag raising.
In the crowd, plainclothes policemen calmly observed the passing crowd.
After 7 a.m., detectives on duty at the bus station spotted two suspicious men following a male passenger onto the No. 20 bus from Yongdingmen Station.
In the car, two suspicious men, one on the left and one on the right, cornered the male passenger in the middle and one of them tried to cover the other.
But what they don't know is that their every move is being watched by the plainclothes police.
In the process of waiting for the man to start stealing, the police kept their eyes on the man who was preparing to steal, and they were caught by the detectives after they stole the hand.
A Beijing Morning Post reporter saw police confiscate 800 yuan in cash from the suspected thieves.
"This is money they took from the passengers' clothes pockets".
Pointing to a torn jacket pocket, the policeman said: "They cut it open and stole 800 yuan from a tourist who came to Beijing, and when we caught them, the money was just put into their own pockets".
Reporters learned that the plainclothes police spent an hour trying to catch the two and finally caught them in the act.
Two suspects are currently under police review.
The plainclothesman warned the complainant that the question of who was suspicious in the crowd was a simple one for the police.
"The more thieves you catch, the more you will find that their eyes and faces are different from ordinary passengers, in addition to holding people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to dig into the crowd instead of hiding".
The police also told reporters that the suspects often wait for the car without a purpose and like to wander around the station and only follow the car after finding the object of the theft.
"These are all words of experience, the laundry has been dry for a long time, it is natural to know".
In addition, the police warned that "the coat closet is the easiest place to store things and the easiest to steal".

Activate rural consumption, purify the market with normalization mechanisms, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of access to farmers' consumption.
The data shows that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, and rural consumer goods retail sales increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, 1.3 percentage points higher than urban growth.
When I visited a poor village in a western county, there was only one convenience store in the whole village.
In recent years, a similar phenomenon has been frequently exposed, and some rural counterfeit goods have similar names, similar names and similar packaging.
According to a consumer survey report released by a western city, the problem of counterfeit supermarkets in rural areas is serious.
Why does Li Keqiang continue to fight year after year against the authorities' crackdown on rural markets?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' awareness of their rights is relatively weak, coupled with the remote location of many rural areas, which are in the blind spot of regulatory forces, allowing counterfeit goods to flourish.
A commodity multi-headed pipe, some departmental pipe price, some pipe production, some pipe market, functional intersection, fake year after year, centralized management of a wind, fake goods hide the headlines, and slowly come out, just finished the old fake, new fake again out.
The lack of a long-term supervision mechanism, the difficulty of cleaning rural markets, the low cost of violating the law, and the large profits have led some illegal traders to start the distorted brain of "going up and down the mountain", and some rural areas have become "disposal markets".
Farmers are moving from subsistence farming to subsistence farming.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued several opinions on improving the mechanism for promoting consumption and further stimulating the consumption potential of rural residents.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reforms, eliminate market supervision policies and management shortcomings, adapt to local conditions, improve food safety and product quality supervision networks, and continuously reduce the space for rural counterfeiting and counterfeiting.
On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen law enforcement and open up the regulatory capillaries to prevent counterfeiting from spreading in rural areas.
No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not be the reason for the proliferation of counterfeit goods. Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities.
Strict market access, strict qualification examination of producers and operators, stop market circulation, allow products to come and go, find ways from the source and root, so that legal dealers can operate safely and farmers can buy with confidence.
Activating rural consumption and guiding healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat well and eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health, and cannot equate rural markets with "low quality" and "cheap".
This requires promoting e-commerce to extend coverage to the vast rural areas, opening up two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the combination of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, supporting the expansion of new forms of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic combination of business and trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc. in qualified townships; improving the modern rural distribution network system, optimizing the integration of storage facilities resources, and effectively reducing rural distribution costs.
To create a clear and reassuring market environment for the countryside, so that farmers can consume without complacency, rural consumption can be more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of achievement and happiness of farmers.
From November 1, China will reduce the MFN tax rate on some goods, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%
In accordance with the decision of the 26th Standing Committee of the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council issued a notice on the 30th to reduce the MFN rate of some goods from November 1, 2018.
According to the announcement of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on the reduction of import tariffs on some goods, in order to adapt to the needs of industrial upgrading, reducing enterprise costs and meeting the multi-level consumption of the masses, the MFN tax rate on some industrial products and other goods will be reduced from November 1 this year.
A total of 1,585 tax items were reduced, accounting for about 19% of the total tax items in China.
The tax reduction mainly concerns textiles; stone, ceramic and glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, construction machinery, power transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc.; resource goods and primary processed goods, such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious stones, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of import tariffs on general tariffs, especially on medicines and daily consumer goods, the import tax rate on imported goods will be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines since May 1 this year, and reduced import tariffs on automobiles and parts and some daily consumer goods since July 1.
Reporters learned from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that since this year, after a series of autonomous adjustments, China's total tariff level will be reduced from 9.8% last year to 7.5%, an average reduction of 23%.
Appropriately reducing tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade and promoting a higher level of opening up to the outside world. It is also conducive to coordinating the use of both international and domestic resources and promoting domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and taking the initiative to reduce the total tariff level is a practical action to implement the spirit of the important speech of General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important measure for China to further expand opening up and take the initiative to expand imports according to its own high-quality development needs.

Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, noodles, noodle soup and other local snacks are often remembered by travelers in other countries.
As China's urbanization level continues to rise, the urban population is growing rapidly, and a large number of rural young people are leaving their hometowns to live in cities.
Liu Xiaojia, a Chinese agricultural brand research expert, said: "Now the pace of urban life is fast and stressful, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life of their childhood, but 'the hometown that cannot be returned, the most beautiful memory is the countryside'.
The special climatic conditions of Ling County, the long hours of sunshine, the large temperature difference between day and night, and the unique conditions for the cultivation of small grains.
More than 20 kinds of small grains are produced in the country, and it is the hometown of small grains in China.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from Ling County who is studying in Tianjin, participated in the presentation as a volunteer, she said: "The people of my hometown are the closest, the taste of my hometown is the most beautiful, the 'Ling Countryman' brand has stirred up too many nostalgia, memories, the most memorable is the food of that time, I hope the 'Ling Countryman' brand will go further and further".
Dr. Yang, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicator data, the detection data of various agricultural products such as buckwheat, sorghum, black beans and other agricultural products in Ling County are outstanding.
Cai Chun, secretary of the Ling County Committee, said that through the launch of the "Ling Villagers" brand, the quality, standardization, and scale of innovation and development of high-quality agricultural products in Ling County can be further improved, which is conducive to shaping a good overall image of agricultural products in Ling County.
Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 0.2% in July from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase that raised expectations for the Bank of Canada's interest rate hike next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth rate hike by the central bank in just over a year.
Analysts polled by Reuters had previously forecast growth of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said Friday that 12 of its 20 industries saw growth.
The data is noteworthy because earlier this month, the central bank predicted that temporary factors could weigh on the third-quarter GDP figures.
The Bank of Canada's governor, Pierre Boroz, on Thursday pledged that the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and will keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be announced on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy grows and unemployment is near record lows.
According to Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at KPMG, the country's economy is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 2% in the third quarter.
"This will be higher than the Bank of Canada's forecast of 1.5%, and therefore will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month", he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps showed that market expectations for the Bank of Canada's rate hike in October increased from 76.46% to 78.27%.
South and North Korea conduct first joint survey of Han River estuary in 65 years
South Korea's Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the 5th that South Korea and North Korea launched a joint survey of the Han River and Linjin River into the sea water on the same day.
The move is a preliminary preparation to ensure freedom of navigation for civilian vessels from both sides.
According to a briefing given to the media by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense on the same day, this was the first time the two sides had conducted a joint inspection of the Hanjiang Sea Entrance since the Korean War Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953.
South Korea and North Korea signed a military agreement in September to jointly inspect the Han River estuary and other waters from November to ensure environmental protection and tourism development in the future.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint survey of the waters at a meeting of generals.
On November 5, the joint Korean-Korean survey of the waters was officially launched.
The joint expedition was made up of 20 people from the South Korean military, experts and others.
According to South Korea's Ministry of National Defense, both sides did not carry weapons during the inspection, and prohibited the use of words or actions to provoke each other.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area used to be an accidental hot spot, but through joint inspection, it will become a new peace zone in the future".
The waters covered by the joint survey are about 70 kilometers long and about 280 square kilometers.
According to the Ministry of National Defense, South Korea will send six survey ships to explore the depth of the sea to provide basic information for safe navigation in the area.
The two Koreas held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on joint use of the Han River and Linjiang River inlets, but subsequent negotiations stalled due to tensions on the peninsula.
Under a military agreement signed in September, vessels from the two Koreas will have to notify each other in advance before sailing through their shared waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, Chinese citizens Guo Yuxin and Mao Xiaoxin lost contact with each other while traveling in Mongolia.
It is understood that the two are members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, the two contacted their relatives and friends in China, saying that they were going to explore the mountains near Lake Kusugul and shared their location via WeChat.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia always attaches great importance to protecting the legitimate rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and attaches great importance to consular protection and assistance.
Upon hearing the news that the two tourists were lost, the embassy immediately launched the emergency plan for the guarantee, and tried to seize the golden rescue time to carry out the work with all its strength.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the families of the victims, assists them in reporting the case to the Mon police immediately, and provides them with a list of translators to choose from.

At the same time, the Embassy assisted the families in launching the search for people in Mun, and actively participated in the search for people in Mun and Chinese-funded enterprises, providing effective leads, and provided relevant assistance to a number of Blue Sky rescue team members who went to Mun to assist in the rescue.
With the strong push of the embassy, the Mongolian side was the first to send a rescue team and promised to waive the search and rescue costs.
The General Directorate of Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations have instructed the police and emergency services of the province of Kusugul to do their utmost in the search and rescue.
As Kuzhul Lake is located in northern Mongolia on the border with Russia, its remote location, sparsely populated area, transportation and communication are extremely inconvenient, and Mongolia has now entered the harsh winter, with temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees, the local police and emergency services have overcome great difficulties.
At the same time, in response to the special situation in the pastoral area, Monfang has been broadcasting through the radio cycle for many days.
Relevant staff of the Blue Sky rescue team have also been actively involved in the rescue.
The safety of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
It has been more than ten days since the two were lost, and the embassy has received several leads, but they have not been found yet, and the search operation is still going on.
The Embassy will continue to pay attention to this matter in accordance with the principle of "people-oriented" and will encourage the Mongolian side to continue to make every effort to search and rescue and provide maximum assistance to the families of the victims.
The Chinese Embassy appealed to compatriots and businesses in Mongolia to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia as soon as possible.
