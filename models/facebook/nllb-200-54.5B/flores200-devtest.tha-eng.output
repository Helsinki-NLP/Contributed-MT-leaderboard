Although an experimental vaccine can reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, so far no drug has been shown to be effective in treating existing infections.
Initially, an antibody cocktail called ZMapp seemed like something that would work well in this setting, although formal research studies have found it to be less effective in preventing deaths than intended.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, which means that scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to three other treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee as well as the Olympic family's desire to promote a truly safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm the prevailing theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides additional details that conventional fossils cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this type of animal have a brownish color, like berries, on the upper part and a brownish or carotenoid color on the lower part.
Such discoveries also shed new light on the evolution of feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed crest called the rachis but had other features of bird feathers such as feathering and barbs, researchers concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that these feathers were not intended for flight, but rather for temperature control or simply for aesthetics.
The researchers point out that even though the dinosaur tail is not very old, the samples show that this is the feather of an adult bird, not a chick.
A car bomb exploded at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, early this morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than two dozen.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh (ISIL) group to be responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun's motion followed the same basic principles as other stars, finding that the various activities of all the stars in the system were driven only by their light and rotation, nothing else.
Both luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less the star will move relative to the Earth's magnetic pole reversal.

The work that's been done is mostly theoretical, but this program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team wanted would be caused by a tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
The Milky Way pulls on the Sagittarius Galaxy in the same way that the Moon pulls on the Earth to create tides.
Scientists can deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter itself.
This theory says that the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a beam around a galaxy and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered XDR-TB in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "very shocking and disturbing because of the very high mortality rate".

During the day, these caves have cooler air than the surrounding surface and warmer air at night.
Their heat is not as stable as large caverns on Earth, which tend to maintain temperatures that are not quite stable, but are due to being buried deep in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a biophysics team, and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is a little bit more low-tech than the old-fashioned way, where the voter sits alone in a cubicle with a pre-printed list of candidates in an envelope.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter must drop the ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter's list.
French electoral law deals with fairly strict procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot box must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are in the box before voting begins and that no envelopes are added except those of eligible voters, which are counted appropriately.
Candidates can send a representative to testify at every stage, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision, according to a special procedure.

Adekoya has been in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of his own son ever since.
She was held pending prosecution and trial in court, but eyewitness accounts may not hold weight due to her photo being widely circulated.
In other places within the UK, this is common practice, but the Scottish justice system doesn't work like this, and the courts considered that the publication of the photographs could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said, "It seems that journalists are treading a dangerous path by releasing images of suspects to the public".
The prosecutor's office, which is responsible for prosecuting the case as a whole, made it clear to reporters that no further comment would be made until the trial was at least over.
According to a leaked report, the document will refer to a border dispute that the Palestinians are seeking by referring to the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded continuous military conscription for 10 years after the agreement was signed, while the Palestinian National Authority agreed to only five years.
Sniper team officers in the enhanced riot control pilot program will be closely monitored by forestry officials as the pilot program is monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In partnership with the NPWS and the National Shooting Sport Association of Australia (NSW), suitably qualified volunteers were selected under the Shooting Sport Association's Hunting Program.
Quoting Mick O'Flynn, the park's director of conservation and heritage along with the NPWS, said the four snipers selected for the first shooting revolution received extensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday Martelly swore in the new nine-member CEP.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended that the resignation of the CEP take place earlier as part of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelly appointed the committee in response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled for 2011.
There have been over 60 reports of iPod malfunctions leading to overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents involving such devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "highly unlikely".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 UTC on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency says there are no reports of domestic damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M-16 at a tourist.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as well as a Filipino photographer.
Later, several photographers came to replace the old woman because she had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an anaesthetist and started work at the Women's National General Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital in her spare time, Liggins began keeping a record of pregnancies and pre-term births.
His research has shown that the use of hormones accelerates the growth of fetal lungs.
Xinhua news agency reports that government investigators have recovered the black boxes, the flight data recorders of two planes on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers have also expressed admiration for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons that looked exactly like her. She was a strong woman".
Dustin "Gold Dust" Runnels commented, "Luna is as crazy as I am...maybe even crazier...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent from 2008.
Julia Gillard, the acting prime minister, said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the most extreme opinion poll, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medallist will be swimming the 100m and 200m freestyle and three breaststroke events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have put a damper on his physical fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome the pain because it was forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The validity of the discovery was verified using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets could have delivered water to Earth, along with organic materials that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the formation of the Earth since the comet struck long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and stupidity".
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
Satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, allows air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide information to pilots more accurately.
No additional transport services will be provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no overground car parks and car parks with links to public transport.
The fear of a transportation shortage made it likely that the game would be forced to be played quietly without the support of the team.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reports the birth of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved within just two generations, although the process is believed to have taken longer due to interbreeding between the native Darwin's ground squirrel (Geospiza fortes) and the Cactus squirrel (Geospiza conirostris).
We can make gold in all kinds of shapes, and we can melt it down.
Gold can be drawn into thin strands that can be bent and melted, and it can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
That gold could be made into thin sheets and applied to other metals; it could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-colored pictures in books called "graphite documents".
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an identifier out of carrot juice.
Carrot juice changes color depending on its level of acidity or chemical resistance.
The pH is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton from which an electron has been removed (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, using clean, wet hands, roll them into balls.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a crust.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a pressure cooker connected to an elaborate sewage treatment system.
Remains of sewage treatment systems have been found in the homes of various cities in the Minoan civilization of Crete and at Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians and Chinese also had baths, and the Romans sometimes had baths that were part of public baths that were shared by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, that means you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space pick up the signal and bounce it back almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets, and scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere bends light and distorts some of our view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it's done for us is make transportation faster and more convenient.
It allows us to have trains and cars and lots of other vehicles.
They are followed by medium-sized tigers and lions, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including open-system cats) that eat a variety of much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of survival, which is a special task that each cat takes on to prevent them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males, as well as up to 30 females and cubs.
Since it's a large family made up of sisters and daughters, the females tend to bond closely.
Packs of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly lion-like creatures (but not as much so as other big cats) and also seriously dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a formidable athlete, able to climb (though not very well), swim, leap, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
Tigers are in the same family as lions, leopards and jaguars, the only four big cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is different from a lion's full-throated roar, but it is more like a threatening roar.
Wildcats like to eat small animals, and if they can, they'll catch monkeys, snakes, mice and birds, almost all of which are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that cats track and track prey by smelling where their prey has been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with their night vision capabilities and move cautiously. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves to blend in with their surroundings and cover their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population (for example, if it moves to live on a mountain or in a river, or moves to a new island so that it cannot easily move back to where it used to live), those organisms often find themselves in a different environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different attributes or be able to adapt to become a stronger competitor than before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all. They still have to adapt in the same way as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like other populations.
After hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, eventually the two populations look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers to the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen we breathe and take in the carbon dioxide we exhale.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We bring plants into our homes and into our clothing, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurs were the greatest hunters of their time, so they feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth with a special set on the roof of the mouth, which means that nothing that passes through can escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included large fish, crabs, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a herbivore.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
Although much of the Roman cuisine is familiar, the Romans themselves had strange or bizarre feasts, such as wild boar, ostriches, snails, and a type of reptile called dorma.
Another difference is that while the poor people and that woman eat sitting down, the rich people prefer to eat together in a generous way, where they sit alone, with their knees bent, while they eat.
You can't count American or Asian food that came to Europe centuries later as ancient Roman food.
For example, the ancient Romans didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians dedicated major temples to their respective gods
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to please them by performing rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard, and then there's the inner temple, which only the priests can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower is a special place for the gods.
The climate in the Middle East is warm, so home is less important.
Jewish families lived most of their lives in the open.
Women cooked in the fields, shops were just open counters facing the street, stones were brought to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no extensive forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
In Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even though he was the discoverer, Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland are very different.
If you've ever seen a movie about a treasure hunt at the edge of the world, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true, although there is something written on the back of the document, but it's not a treasure map.
The text on the back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776", with the text appearing at the bottom of the document when folded down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, we do know that early in life this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it's possible that a note was added to the inscription.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French from the "Vichy Zone", the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned it over to Germany in just two weeks.
A civilization is a single culture shared by large groups of people who live and work together in society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civilian, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town-state, and also defines the size of a society.
The city-state represents the nation, the rich culture represents the transmission of knowledge across generations, the lingering cultural footprints, and the equitable distribution of wealth.
Subcultures often disappear without leaving any evidence of historical relevance and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states established the first rough federal government under the Articles of Confederation, with a single legislature.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and since there is no national or equivalent executive, relies on state agencies that often do not cooperate in enforcing all acts of Congress.
Furthermore, Congress does not have the power to override state and local tariffs.
Legislation requires unanimous consent from all the states before it can be amended, and the states don't pay much attention to the federal government, and even state representatives don't often attend.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, futsal, rugby union, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the north, with Italians competing in international games and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshū being the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because the land in Japan is full of groups or archipelagos, Japan is often referred to geographically as "the archipelago".
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform traditional methods of rice production and recruit Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan the capital of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (2437-2438) in 2438, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki to cede sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 2488.
Machu Picchu, the site of the ancient Inca civilization, consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana Time Stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the surrounding area have been reconstructed so that tourists have a chance to see how things used to be.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of still photography in the world is 35 mm, a film size that played an important role in the end of the analog film era.
This type of film is still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been transferred from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35mm format, which is 33mm wide and 24mm high, is quite confusing.
Ratios of this form (divided by 12 to become the simplest whole number ratio) are thus said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. those in the APS family, etc.) have values equal to or approximately close to the aspect ratio of this image.
The much-overlooked and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating pivots while maintaining the right amount of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main object is at the intersection of the line that divides the image into three parts, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which was getting richer and more powerful, was under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity held Europe together despite its different languages and traditions.
The spread of power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and extreme poverty, and church funds exist for precisely that reason.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money made many question whether the faith was being practiced.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, the British blockaded German sea lines of communication.
Such tactics have proven effective at depriving civilians and military assets of much-needed supplies, even though such blockades violate generally accepted international law, codified by numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain placed minefields in international waters to prevent ships from entering certain parts of the ocean, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and countries wanted peace and unity.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations did not want them repeated in the future
In 2427, Tesla moved to the United States to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods by dividing China into periods, or dynasties, each with its own characteristics.
The period between each dynasty was a time when the separate provinces were unstable. The best known period was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
The fierce wars between the many warlords fighting for the throne took place during these times.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands died fighting for the throne in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
The social and political implications are many, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolute monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, professions were also opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
It's the same for the military, because instead of having a hierarchy of ranks, you have a hierarchy of cameras.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a great interest in the transcendent, and he would often go to a cave, later known as Hira, on Mount Noor, to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, presents a clear picture of a spiritual tendency.
This cave is on a single hill, one that is north of Mecca and completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, but even if you do, once you're inside the cave, it's like you're completely cut off from the outside world.
There's nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky above and the mountains all around, and you can barely see or hear anything from the outside world when you're inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many massive pyramid structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Giza or "Great Tomb of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead consists of various pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
Great pyramids were built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "bohai" symbol resembles a V, while the "bow-shaped" symbol resembles a paper sewing loop or a bottomless square.
Up means you should start at the end of the lever and pull up, and down means you should start at the ponytail of the lever and pull down.
Normally, an upstroke violin produces a softer sound, while a downstroke violin produces a more powerful and heavy sound.
You can draw the notation yourself, but remember that the printed punctuation is there for musical reasons, so normally it should be respected.
The dreaded King Louis XVI, his queen Marie-Antoinette, his sons and their two mothers (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and Madame Élisabeth, the king's mistress, were forced to leave Versailles and return to Paris by a group of market women on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, where they were surrounded by a mob who jeered and threatened the King and Queen.
The crowd pressured the king and Rakhine to keep the carriage windows open at all times.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the heads of the royal guards slaughtered at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay for the war to conquer the Philippines for the American empire.
They needed to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray most of the costs and interest on bonds held in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the maximum profit derived from the pursuit of the long-term interests of the Filipino people would count as the primary interests of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templar Order, we need to understand the context in which it was founded.
The era in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, which spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD) of European history.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas with applications ranging from the technological imperative or technological necessity to the neutral notion that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic involving scientific laws and technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological innovation share two general ideas: that technology develops in ways that are largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology "affects" existing societies by nature rather than by social conditioning.
For example, we could say that cars inevitably lead to better roads (1).
However, a nationwide road network would not be economically viable if there were only a few cars on the road, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
In addition, the huge number of car owners has also increased road accidents, which has led to new techniques for repairing damaged tanks.
Imagism has many of the elements of cultural mysticism that were taken from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, there are traditions and cultures associated with geography, and those that are consistent with the place of a society are better than arbitrary rules.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe in the same way that Paris had a reputation as the fashion capital of the modern world.
The vernacular of being the center of luxury started around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The place's status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the Crusaders returning gifts such as silks and spices which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, there was a shift in the fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height of popularity between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early on, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, slow communication channels may have set Western styles back by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own styles, and one of the greatest developments of the period was that the Crusaders began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic farming system using locally grown seeds combined with crop rotation or other simple sustainable techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers and still are in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures may differ markedly because of the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through the use of distinctive symbolic styles, such as fashion, slang, and group-specific vocabulary.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of social exclusion is to take advantage of the case of some unfortunate children who were abandoned, unfortunate, or deliberately abused and were not excluded by adults while growing up.
These children are called "rebels" or "Geres". Some rebellious children are imprisoned by people (often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment occurs because the parents cannot accept the mental or physical disability of the child.
Feral children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or on the run.
Others are said to have been tamed by animals, some even said to live in the woods themselves.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, children in wildlife-like conditions will exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of their caretaker animals, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning can make learning more accessible and engaging, scaffolding can do more.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, but it's a way of supporting people who are learning something new, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and physical -- for example, a teacher is one form of scaffolding, but the little paper clip people in Microsoft Office are also scaffolding.
Virtual Scaffolds are built into the software itself and are designed to ask questions, provoke, and explain steps that students might find difficult to do on their own.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse or even threats.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where they're not nurtured and cared for and educated, but they do.
We understand that the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the essentials that are lacking in the child's previous home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and ways of generating satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When they examined audience reactions to the site, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" as new motivations.
The introduction of video recording has led to important discoveries about the interpretation of instantaneous facial expressions, which are a few milliseconds of facial movement.
In particular, it has been claimed that people can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting minute facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his study of presidential speeches, looked at how people who couldn't understand speech due to concussion were able to evaluate sincerity.
He even suggested that there might be some animals, like domestic dogs, that have these different abilities to interpret human behavior as well.
Research during the 20th century suggested that there were two groups of genetic variations: those that were not expressed and those that were expressed.
Mutations increase genetic diversity, and the process of selection weeds out those variations that show up.
Separation and reintegration switched forms between the two generations.
In the savannah, mammals with human-like digestive systems can barely meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so can have serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resource to access would be the protein that's available in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have a hard time digesting that unless it's cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods, in addition to being easily digestible, provide protein, which has all the essential amino acids in high amounts.
All things considered, it's not surprising that our ancestors would have solved this protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep paralysis is the process of purposefully waking up during your normal sleep time and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you up.
If you often move your alarm clock during sleep, you can put the clock far away on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on circadian rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before bed, which will make you urinate more.
The level of inner peace that an individual has varies with the level of stress in that individual's body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive energy we all have the potential to find true peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our obsession with negativity.
Buddhism in Tibet is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has incorporated Mahayana teachings and a lot of yoga techniques from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of the virtues of yoga, meditation and the all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of kundalini energy through yoga postures, breathing exercises, prayer and mindfulness.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, where energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is achieved through the visualization of deities.
Germany was a common enemy of the Soviet Union and the United States in World War II, so that led to a partnership between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies again, and the Cold War began.
It's going to be around for the next 40 years, and it's going to be fought virtually by proxy armies in the various empires from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were broken and the only hope was to fall back and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, overnight, these plans became obsolete as more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered Belarus and Ukraine after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is considered the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Historically, the Navy's job has been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to move people and goods, and to prevent the ability of the enemy to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, which relied heavily on U-boats, was trying to stop the shipping.
If the Allies failed, Germany might be able to conquer England because it had already conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Generally, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, similar to the more widely known method of sheep farming, where the goat herder was often a child or adolescent.
The turnpike was built in England in the early 1600s.
Despite having only parallel planks, the dragway allowed the horse to accelerate and pull more weight on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Railroad tie rods were introduced to hold the rails in place fairly quickly. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective with steel on top.
This became a common practice, but the steel made Gavin's wooden wheels feel more elegant.
Eventually, steel wheels replaced wooden ones, and in 1767, the first all-steel rails were used.
The earliest known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright normally.
Expert bipedalism is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is the same as treating the symptoms in many cases, however, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Obviously, the world has changed a lot because of human scientific and technological progress, and the problems have increased because of human overpopulation and high living standards.
After passage by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by John Hancock, President of Congress, and Charles Thompson, Secretary of State, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made of what is now known as the "Dunlap broadside".
John Nixon read this document in public for the first time at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to the troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 extant copies of the Declaration of Independence are the oldest surviving copies of this document, the original manuscript having been lost.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived on today, and we call those dinosaurs birds.
A lot of people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs just like the T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on information processing that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxins may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common symptoms that cannot be immediately diagnosed.
The best indicator of ingestion may be the presence of open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
Entomologists officially call these insects hard-winged beetles.
The word is derived from the ancient familiarity of fleas, which are insects that have adapted well to live on human bodies.
Both killer whales and porpoises are helpless creatures when hatched, having to adapt to living in a nest or caretaker's dwelling.
Across the United States, an estimated 400,000 people have multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research studies have found that females are twice as likely as males to have multiple sclerosis, or MS.
A couple decides that having a baby is not what they or their child wants.
These couples may choose to have a child through planned adoption.
In an adoption, the birth parent gives up custody of the child so that another couple can raise the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides almost all scientific research.
Experiments and tests are tests used to eliminate at least one possible hypothesis by asking questions, and observation is also a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were interested in ancient Greek and Roman literature, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view is accepted in all branches of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The many different rhythms in biological mechanisms and observed behaviors often depend on the existence of cycles within the body and the functioning of those cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms (which are not just responses to external, periodic stimuli) have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to operate independently even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiments were one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to embed their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, identifying the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or identifying the phage protein with radioactive iodine.
The effects of a mutation vary depending on the type of mutation, the key features of the affected gene, and whether the affected cell is a progenitor cell.
Only mutations in a gene-carrying cell can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cells to die or become cancerous.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including trees and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, gardening, and learning about ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans on the island of Borneo.
Every morning, people would drive out of small towns in the countryside on their way to work, crossing paths with people on their way to work in the places they had just left.
In this autonomous public transportation, everyone is contributing or subsidizing private car travel in one way or another.
Science now tells us that this carbon-intensive economy has upset the balance of Earth's living space and atmosphere that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everybody is part of society and uses transportation, and almost everybody complains about transportation.
In the developed world, you hardly hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transportation system generate so many complaints, why do mistakes happen every day, transportation engineers are incompetent, or something more fundamental happens?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement between two points of a particular driver and vehicle and the interaction that the two have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave pretty much the same way, so the flow of traffic tends to be fairly uniform, so you can roughly approximate it mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationship between three key properties is established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of street facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings to their own length.
Gives them a little more variety of places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are ladybugs and whiteflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some agreed with his idea, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
Makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world, with more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, at times up to six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is a confluence of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical elegance of the Great Pyramid of Giza is still considered superior.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were amazed when they saw the tombs of their ancestors that were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the world's smallest sovereign state and least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Most people working in the state used Italian in everyday life, while Latin was often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in primitive forms and are relatively easy to extract with modern tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was composed of at least one or more of four elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter -- solid, liquid, gas and plasma, in that order -- but he also theorized that they would change into new matter to form what we see.
Generally speaking, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alternatively, you could have an alloy that has a small amount of a metallic element, like carbon, mixed in.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that they can be packed into the period at the end of this sentence into trillions of atoms.
That's why pencils are a great friend to many people when they come to the market.
Sadly, as new forms of writing emerged, cuneiform became less important and less useful.
People can now type on a computer screen without ever having to get close to a pencil frog.
We wondered what would happen to the printing press when something new came along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Similar to climbing a mountain, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no back and forth motion.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer surface of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side is about 70 kilometers thick and the far side is about 100 kilometers thick.
The Moon's crust is thinner in the maria, but thicker in the highlands.
The near side may have more maria because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to erupt to the surface.
Content theory focuses on investigating what makes people choose or care.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that emerge internally as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they've got and what in their environment causes them to take action or not take action.
Two well-known contextual theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can occur when a manager leads a former colleague.
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, enforcing discipline, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
Conversely, one person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she has to change everything the team has ever done and make it their own.
Either way, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This kind of behavior often creates a disconnect between the leader and everyone else on the team.
The teams seemed to have the same standards of excellence as the typical traditional team, but with one glaring difference.
Virtual team members often act as contact centers for physically close groups.
They tend to have more do-it-yourself team members than traditional ones, since their teams may meet in different time zones, which local managers may not understand.
Having a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all members report, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning is to innovate.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments across the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Thus, the process of organizations working together to overcome obstacles can lead to new processes that are more innovative in meeting customer needs.
Before organizations can have startups, leadership needs to create a culture of startups and sharing and learning within the organization.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method for helping organizations achieve higher performance.
Neuroscientific data provides physical evidence for theoretical cognitive research, which in turn helps narrow the scope of the research and make it more precise.
The interconnected relationship between brain pathology and behavior will help support scientists in their research.
It's long been known that brain damage from injury, disease, and tumors affects behavior and causes changes in certain mental functions.
Increasingly, new technologies are allowing us to see and examine structures and processes in parts of the brain that we never could before.
This gives us a lot of information and context to model situations that help us understand mental processes.
Although AI is clearly the stuff of science fiction, it's also an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research study of AI involves making machines perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer comments and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines focused on delivering solutions to real-life problems.
Today, AI systems are commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being built into software applications for home computers and various video games.
Field trips are an important part of every classroom, and often teachers take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a way to solve problems by visualizing the real world, so students can look at artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with others in the classroom.
Sharing virtual learning experiences is a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina designed a website for their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old version is still available online for use as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, having a mentor can often help correct those mistakes.
Since students are often the most important group of readers, bloggers began to heavily edit their writing to avoid being criticized.
Blogging also "pushes students to understand more about the world around them". The desire to respond to readers' interests motivates students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of class.
Appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to become more analytical and critical, enabling them to place themselves in the context of others' writing by actively responding to Internet content as well as expressing their own views on a given topic" (Araveg, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada and offers an array of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, while to the north are the unspoiled natural beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
These and other things make Ontario stand out as the heart of Canada to outsiders.
Large areas far to the north are sparsely populated and some areas are so barren that hardly any people live there.
A population comparison that surprises many people is that there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
With Madagascar being the largest island and so much bigger than all the other islands, it's really a continent in terms of its flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are sovereign nations or dependencies of France and are named after luxury beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam to various lands and it became very popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European and colonial influence began in the 15th century when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, found a canal route from Europe to India.
It is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I recommend that all female tourists say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring would be helpful (but not too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can make them think of abuse, and it's not unusual to be followed, to hold hands and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether or not cultural differences make it acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century, and Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established a trading post there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tajines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and many other items, but all of these are only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2005, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Irrawaddy volcano, burying almost all of the city's roads, especially in the downtown area.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is advisable to study the information before traveling outside the city to understand the protracted fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as hiking in search of the tallest mountain gorilla in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle hire) with the normal (local) price being around 500 CFA for a short trip.
Combined with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for a distant and exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its fame as a tourist destination and airport.
In 2003, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
This is one of the key stops on Henry Louis Gates' extraordinary African Wonders series on PBS.
This city is completely different from the other cities of the country because it has an atmosphere more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometres, divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major tourist attractions and is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There is a conservation fee and a daily entrance fee as in other South African national parks.
In addition, if one buys a Wild Card entry ticket, it may be worthwhile because it can enter all national parks in South Africa, which may choose to enter only some or all of them as desired (1).
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its reputation and is also a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The terraced buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are contrasted with the light bar map made visible simply by the water surface that appears in Victoria Harbour.
If you want the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonialists claimed as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of this colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching some 80 kilometres (50 mi) into the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India far from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the borders of India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
It's not just old-growth forest that's gone, there are also remnants of the great forests that once covered the steppe.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about a third is covered by water.
It has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. It is estimated that there are currently about 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 giraffes.
Passenger trains leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, with most eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang trains leaving between 06.30 and 07.30.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
In most prefectures there are small Japanese passenger coaster which are comfortable and stable waiting to serve
One-way taxis together provide a convenient and quick means of travel to nearby destinations, for example to Paro (150 nmi) and to Punakha (200 nmi).
The Tayapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Tayapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and consist of two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) above the ground. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs gate is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous people who lived in what is now eastern Paraguay, making their living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous peoples such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once dubbed the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish were responsible for three centuries of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on polo events and where to buy tickets, please check the Asociación Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official currency in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, across from FIC West.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island, as are Stanley credit cards, and U.S. dollars are widely accepted as well.
It is possible that the outer islands may not accept credit cards, although they do accept British and American currency, so check with the owners beforehand to determine the method of payment used.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Island currency outside the islands, so exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer there, and when it's summer in the northern hemisphere, it's winter there.
Montevideo is in the subtropics, and in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are normal.
Winters can be unseasonably cold, meaning the temperature itself barely drops below freezing, but will feel colder than the thermometer indicates due to wind and humidity.
There are no distinct rainy and dry seasons; rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the zoo are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials advise staying at least 100 yards or meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards or meters away from all other wildlife.
No matter how majestic they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, please be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong smelling food, and always keep campsites clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval conflict in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave port.
All ships were sunk except for one British patrol boat, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mayan movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the great chief.
There are a lot of beaches because Oakland has two harbors on either side of it.
North Shore Beach (in North Harbor District) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
These are sandy beaches that are almost all safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is on the Waitematā Harbour in the posh suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier in central Auckland.
Sometimes these beaches are very family-oriented, with shops lining the shore, and swimming is safe.
The leading local beer brand is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer but has a pleasant taste and a fresh feeling. Another local beer brand is called "Manta" (1).
There's a lot of French wines you can't go wrong with, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be more your speed.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're scared, it's easy to find bottled water.
For Australians, flat white coffee is a rarity; short black is an espresso; cappuccinos require heavy cream; and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is considered to be of Belgian quality. The fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Throughout the year, there are many tourist trips to the reef, and you don't see a lot of these kinds of injuries on the reef.
However, please follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appeared near the beaches and near the mouths of rivers from October to April in the north of the city.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't primarily live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations reassure travelers that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually deal with hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping tents, through travel agencies.
Usually, travel agents offer a package that includes breakfast and transportation to/from the airport or even a package of airfare and hotel.
They can also hold your booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your trip (e.g. a visa).
Any corrections or complaints should be made through a travel agent rather than contacting the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, attendees camp out on the grounds because most see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to get up close and personal, you have to get there early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage may be over, some festivals will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
The location of the cabin should be checked if sailing across the northern Baltic during the winter, as sailing through ice will produce a rather frightening noise for those most likely to be affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise also includes time in the city. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please check conditions).
Casinos generally try their best to make all guests spend as much money and time as possible, often with no windows or clocks and difficult to find exit doors.
They often have food, drinks and entertainment on offer to keep guests happy and in place.
Some establishments do serve alcohol, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and good gamblers understand the importance of being sober.
Anyone who must drive in high or mountainous terrain should also be prepared for snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads with lots of snow, the traction is low, making it impossible to drive as well as when driving on unpaved roads.
During a blizzard, snow can fall so much that you can't get anywhere in a short time.
Visibility may be limited by falling or blowing snow or condensed water droplets or ice on a car window.
On the other hand, cold and snowy weather is common in many countries, and most traffic is light throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to a journey overland to see Africa's spectacular wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the car, and standard equipment will give you good visibility.
Sometimes lions and cheetahs and leopards are shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A safari (also called "hiking", "safari", or "hiking") consists of walking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held in 2021 from 24 August to 5 September. Some events will be held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, having done so in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be experiencing some difficult situations.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-induced cancellations will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics have been scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will be priced from 2,500 yen up to 130,000 yen, with a regular ticket priced at 7,000 yen.
Drying wet clothes helps keep them dry. Many hotels offer a drying rack and drying table, even if not in the room.
If you don't have a curling iron, or if you don't plan on wearing curling socks, you might want to try a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the cloth (which may cause shrinkage or sunburn in severe cases).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters have performance differences that you should be aware of, and you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter disturbing animals they are not familiar with in their native regions.
Pests can cause food loss, irritation, or worse, they can cause allergies, spread toxins or spread pathogens.
Infectious organisms or dangerous animals that can physically harm or kill people are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in some areas.
Sometimes a tourist in a high-tax country can get a reasonable discount, especially on alcohol and tobacco.
The long gravel road between Point Marion and Fairmont has some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which often passes through heavily wooded country.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to deal with a variety of difficult situations, including slippery roads, narrow lanes, and hairpin turns.
The posted speed limit is significantly lower in the front and rear sections, normally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence is paramount.
But surprisingly, the cell service here is stronger than many other places along the same route, like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria they're as plentiful and varied as those of our neighbor to the south, which is Austria itself.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples available year-round, while cherries and plums are available during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Gung is a type of food that is made from herbs and spices mainly by cooking together with various meats or vegetables.
The slurry can be either "dry" or "liquid", depending on the amount of liquid.
The northern coastal regions of India and Pakistan often use yogurt in the Ganges, but it is more common to use ghee in southern India and other coastal regions of the peninsula.
Since there are 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a broad term encompassing regional cuisines throughout the country.
But if used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of Java.
Shva cuisine, which is now widely available throughout the archipelago, consists of simple dishes. Distinctive Shva seasonings include lentils, peppers, sugar (especially Shva lemon sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle contains the rider's shoes, which hang down at the sides of the saddle.
This gives the rider more stability, but there can be safety concerns as the rider's feet can get caught inside.
If the rider is thrown from the back of the horse but the foot is still stuck in the stirrup, they may be dragged behind the horse if the horse runs away. Several safety precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear boots with heels and flat, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially British saddles, have a safety strap that keeps the leather strap from slipping off the saddle if the rider is thrown from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley is Chile's premier climbing site, the Yosemite of South America, with its huge granite walls and many cliffs.
There are spectacular views from the summit, and climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes through endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts. It is sometimes referred to as a "ski boom", which is the planning of an entire vacation to ski at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is ancient, with cave paintings indicating skiers as early as 5,000 BC.
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in 1861 in Australia.
Backpacking on skis, also known as cross-country skiing, cross-country skiing, or cross-country skiing
This type of skiing may be classified as an activity similar to alpine skiing or mountaineering, but is usually unrelated. Alpine skiing is played on steeper terrain and requires skis and boots with a much stronger appearance.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover more distance than walking, but you don't often get the chance to reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy pack on an adapted treadmill.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many sovereign states, and in normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries means multiple visas and multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen area will function somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you're in this zone, you can normally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities will classify items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.

A rip current is a wave that travels in the opposite direction to the shore, usually on a coral reef or similar area.
Underwater topology causes countercurrents to be more intense at deeper levels, and fast-flowing deep-water currents may form there.
Most of the deaths were from exhaustion while trying to turn the water back on, which was probably not going to happen.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim where you won't get caught, otherwise you may have to wait for rescue, depending on your skill and whether or not someone is watching you.
The shock of returning to one's home country occurs earlier than the (initially shorter) culture shock, lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Tourists who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes face difficulties, especially in readjusting to the culture of their homeland.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have forgotten some of the customs of your home culture.
When you go abroad in the early days, people tend to be patient and understanding, because they know that people who move to a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers who are returning home.

In remote locations where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones, as they need to be out in the open with an unobstructed path to the satellite for torrenting.
There are many transportation uses for this, including cruise ships and exploration that require both data and voice over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year-long vacation is to travel and learn.

Finland is a great sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and on the islands along the coast.
You don't need a boat to sail between islands and lakes.
Although the largest coastal islands and lakes are wide enough for yachts to sail through, a small boat or even a kayak gives you a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight Finns.
This is on a par with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is 1 in 40).
Most of the prominent Baltic cruise ships make long stopovers in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two or three full days by sleeping on the boat at night.
If you come ashore solely as a boat tourist, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships have pictures of Berlin in Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and such sightseeing is not included in the cruise price.

A common way to travel first or business class is to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, these services do not come cheap. Roughly speaking, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class as for economy class and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in trying to get a discount on a business or first class seat on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a core group of air travelers who are willing to pay top dollar for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.

By the same standard, men must wear knee-length pants.
But these clothes are not washed after every use, so you may feel uncomfortable wearing these one-size-fits-all skirts!
The traditional Majorcan cuisine is similar to the Mediterranean cuisine in its use of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and often uses olive oil for everything.
