While an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce the death rate from Ebola, there are no medications that have so far proven effective in treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially appeared promising in the field, but formal studies indicated it was less beneficial than thought in preventing death.
In the PALM study, the ZMapp served as a control, which means that researchers used it as a starting point and compared the other three treatments up against it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils in general cannot, like colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Researchers say this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the upper body with a pale or carotenoid-colored underparts.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other feather characteristics - barbs and barbules - researchers assumed that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display, and although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimens show adult plumage and not down from a juvenile.
The researchers commented that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a juvenile.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 other people.

They found that the Sun operated on the same basic principle as other stars: it was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversal.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal forces between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a gravitational pull on Sagittarius.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "highly disturbing and alarming because of the high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus at the hospital, and that at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
During a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected, at any given time in South Africa.

"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as large caves on Earth which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but this is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team from Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper ticket indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the voting procedure and that no envelopes are added except those of carefully vetted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow every step of the process, and in the evening the votes are tallied by volunteers under close observation and following specific procedures.

Police chief inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck, none of them were injured.
The driver of the car, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the wreckage of the Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son in Edinburgh Magistrates' Court.
She is in custody awaiting her arraignment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be manipulated as her photographs have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system operates differently and the court has considered the publication of the photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
University of Dundee professor Pamela Ferguson said "journalists seem to be taking a dangerous direction if they publish photos and the like of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed while the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to such a presence for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control project were to be monitored thoroughly by weighers while the impact of the project was assessed and monitored.
In a partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sport Shooting Organisation of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sport Shooting Organisation's hunting programme.
According to the Acting Director of Park Protection and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the first four selected shooters of the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the lack of elections, some dating back to 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Department of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's release of the report "extremely regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Agency, there were no reports of damage in the Commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six people are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, the children and the elders, were released at an early stage, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a obstetrician and started work at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could accelerate the maturation of the lungs of the fetus.
Xinhua reported Wednesday that government investigators had found the two 'black boxes' containing the plane's audio recordings.
Other athletes also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin "Gold Dust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe even more...loves her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place".
An opinion poll of 1,400 people taken before the 2010 federal election found that those opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled shared this view and wished Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but as a result of his complaints, questions have been raised about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic material to form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed since the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this month and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims can allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport services have been added and trains over the hill will not stop at Wembley. In addition, parking and car parking are not available at the venue.
Fears of a lack of transport have hinted at the possibility of the matches being played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species was developed after only two generations, although it was thought that this process took much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the Mediterranean Sparrow, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be worked to any desired shape and can be rolled into very small objects.
It can be spun into thin threads that can be twisted and folded, and it can be hammered and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage candle changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogenions are protons stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together before pressing them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, as well as in the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Researchers use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
It takes a big rocket that's over 100 feet too tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us a much easier and faster mode of transportation.
It's given us the train, the car, and many other transportation units.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that are a medium prey, ranging from hares to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that eat a much more varied array of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live together in large groups called prides.
Flocks are formed of one to three adult males, along with as many as thirty lionesses and their cubs.
The lionesses are usually related, forming a large family with sisters and daughters.
Packs of lions act very much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A highly flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not very well), swim, leap long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of a lion, but more like a series of growling, roaring words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals, preferably monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, but almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than these.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find prey by using their sense of smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
Ocelots hunt by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings while stalking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move across a mountain range or an river, or if they move to a new island from which it is difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment very different from that from which they came.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors which means that the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor, than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they need to continue the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, becoming more and more different from the second population.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means formation of new species. speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurs were top consumers in their time, so they feared nothing - except other mosasaurs.
The long jaw of the male was surrounded by more than 70 razor sharp teeth, and an extra set in the roof of the mouth.
His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything in the water - even gigantic dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans nevertheless had some unusual dishes for their banquets, including wild boar, peafowl, snails and a type of rodent called a sjusovar.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals seated, the rich men liked to have banquets together while lying on their sides when eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods brought to Europe or the Americas from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians primarily built a temple to each of their deities, which they considered their home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary to which only priests had access.
At times, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the importance of the house declined.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no major forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled; in the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Although he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at this time.
Although each of these lands was 'Scandinavian', there were vast differences in the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true because when there is writing on the back, there is no treasure map.
Written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large vellum document (it measures 29 3⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a meaning.
The D-Day landings and the following battle had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy regime, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and independent French forces had liberated the south of France, and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people of significant size who live and work together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town, and in a sense also defines the size of a society.
A civilizational culture insinuates the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lingering cultural imprint and equitable sharing.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to tax and, lacking any executive or judicial branch, relied on uncooperative state governments to enforce its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The resolutions required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, are the second most successful football teams in the world, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the International Games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
As a consequence of its clusters of islands, Japan is often referred to geologically as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native grain production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the rebuilding process continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from digital cameras' sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, confusingly, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest complete ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats for example) are equal to, or roughly the same as, this aspect ratio.
The much criticized and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in pictures.
It states that the most effective placement for key subjects is at the intersection of the lines, which divide images into thirds vertically and horizontally (see examples).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church exist for precisely this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective at cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international laws codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from entering all oceans and inflicted damage on even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most residents were pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the hardships and heartbreak of war during the First World War, nations wish to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a certificate from Charles Batchelor (his former manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique view of different periods; each step of China and each family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these periods, there was often warfare between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying as they fought for supremacy in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Post-revolutionary positions were also open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applied to the military as rankings became based on ability rather than class, as they had been previously.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people, from the oppressed working classes of other countries, to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his everyday life, and often used a mine known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for his contemplation.
The mine itself, which has survived the ravages of time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decline.
The mine sits on top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there.
Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and is one of many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-arcing" mark looks like a V and the "down-arcing" mark that a pin or square is missing from the underside of it.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-pull generally produces a softer sound, while a down-pull is stronger and more distinct.
Feel free to make your own marks, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified Queen.
The war expenditures of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray a large part of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking system.
The superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the foundational achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that allowed for the formation of the Order.
The era in which these events unfolded is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came after the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological progress or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on society that are immanent, rather than socially determined.
For example, one can say that the motor car will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Public car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the discovery of new techniques for treating injured people by the healthcare system.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, derived from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography shaped the individuals, and over time, the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the site of the society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, took place.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
Because of the slowness of communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own distinctive style.
Subsistence agriculture is the practice of producing enough food to meet the needs of the individual farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds sourced from the eco-region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals, who feel ignored by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that distinguish one subculture from another may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or intentional mistreatment, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some feral children have been abandoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment was the result of a parent's rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before being abandoned or escaping.
Others have been claimed to be raised by animals; some have been thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those exhibited by carnivores, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Whereas project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructive design is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but so is the little binder-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised into the software and is meant to guide and clarify procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they are.
We look at the child welfare system as a safety net for these kids.
Our child welfare system is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers and stable education, as well as reliable health care.
Foster homes were meant to cover all the needs that were lacking in the homes they were taken away from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet led to multiple dimensions of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for networking (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when examining audiences' reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his treatise The President's Speech, indicated how human beings who are unable to understand speech as a result of brain damage, nevertheless are able to judge freeness correctly.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two stores of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two traditions with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human's to fulfill its need for amino acids from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most available resources for a panther would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only are animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) digestible, but they are high in protein, containing all the necessary amino acids.
Given all of this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally falling asleep during your normal sleep period and then falling asleep again shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during sleep, it can be moved to the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) prior to sleep, which will force one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calmness a person feels is inversely related to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force, each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is god-yoga, whereby through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but by the end of the war the conflicting systems, processes, and cultures prevented their countries from coming together.
Within two years of the war's end, the two were allied enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in real time, by proxy forces, on battlefields from the Americas to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along Romanian bridgeheads.
These plans, however, became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the United States sought to move men and material across the Atlantic to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures started the domestication of animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were normally kept in herds to graze on the high ground or other suitable grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were often children or young adults.
Wooden railway tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these rails only consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
Sills were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that rails were more effective if a little iron was driven in at the top.
This became common, but the iron led to greater wear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of human transportation, Homo erectus, began walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright.
Tooth specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being nicer to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future burdens to some degree.
Now, in many cases, this is the same thing as treating symptoms, but if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to get to the root of the problem and solve it.
It's obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of humans and problems have been getting bigger because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of humans.
After Congress passed the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" known to still exist are the earliest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, which we call birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
So virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity is not always easy to detect; symptoms (such as vomiting) may be so diffuse as to preclude immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pillbox or exposed household chemicals.
Check the label to find out what kind of first aid you should give for that drug.
In a formal sense, entomologists apply the term "insect" to this group of insects.
This concept stems from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predators and prey are nidicolae, adapted to live in nests or the host's house.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
According to research, women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple might decide that it's not the best thing for them, or the best thing for the child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to adopt the baby.
In cases of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights and allow another couple to adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method, which serves as the guideline for most scientific research.
An experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were the accepted ones, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was torn away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-perpetuating oscillation generators that will continue with periods of free cycling even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They performed two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the radioactive phosphorus layer or the protein in the radioactive sulfur layer.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are kimbane cells.
Only mutations in kimbane cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to view the beautiful landscape, including plant and animal life.
Activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people get in their cars and leave small suburbs to go to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport back and forth, everyone is in some way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everybody participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems elicit so many complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental at work?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of vehicles and drivers between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range; traffic flows are thus often reasonably stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A ratio is established between the three main characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, with the ability to fly allowing them to more easily evade predators and find food and mates more quickly.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them more little places to choose from when they need to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are mayflies and mayflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed in it, but many believed the opposite, that it was the solar system that moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and all the other stars).
Which isn't surprising, because it doesn't really feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth, having more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
It is also the widest river on Earth, measuring up to 6 miles (9.5 km) in width.
Fully 20 percent of all the water that flows out of all the world's rivers and into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size or technical prowess of the Giza pyramids.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of around 800, Vatican City is the smallest sovereign state in the world by population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since these elements occur naturally and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new matter and form what we see.
An alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that are made up of small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there's room for trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been downgraded to a lower status and used less as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now type messages on computer screens and don't need a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, when you split the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to separate with little or no interaction.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the mares (the dark areas) and thicker under the light areas.
There may be more marls on the near side because the crust is thinner and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that human beings have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we grow up.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things that they want, and what it is in their environment that causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors typically occur when leaders start hiring colleagues that they were previously at the same level with.
This type of leader has trouble making unpopular decisions, reprimanding employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who becomes an unrecognizable person, and who feels that he or she has to change everything that the group has been doing, and make it his or her own.
After all, it is ultimately the leader who is responsible for the ups and downs of the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams maintain the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often act as contact points for the immediate physical group.
They often govern themselves more independently than conventional group members because their groups often meet after varying time zones, which may not be met with understanding by the local leadership.
The fact that the group is truly "invisible" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109), is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The invisible group is the leadership group to which each member reports, and sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and invention can flourish.
An outcome of this process of an organization working together to tackle an obstacle, is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in the research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Although "science fiction" has strong associations with artificial intelligence (AI), AI is a very important part of computer science when it comes to dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military and is embedded in several PC and video game applications.
Excursions are a large part of all teaching, and it is quite common for a teacher to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, for example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the largest city in the state, and every year they redesign the website, but keep the old versions online as a kind of scrapbook.
Although students often start out with poor grammar and spelling, they usually improve once they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to better understand the world around them" and the need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual and charming capital of Canada, Ottawa is also home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and its northern section is home to the disused and scenic Muskoka Falls.
All this and more makes Ontario the most typically Canadian province in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north have fairly scattered settlements, and some areas are almost deserted wilderness.
Here's a comparison that will surprise many people: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are people in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most diverse continent in terms of animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and known as luxury resorts with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a major impact on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, it is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would see as harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after a 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of shisha, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most city streets, especially in the center, were covered with lava.
It's relatively safe in Goma, but should you travel outside of Goma, you need to investigate carefully to find out how the situation is in the province of North Kivu with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
The town is also used as a base camp for climbers wishing to reach the Nyiragongo volcano, and is also the starting point for those wishing to take one of the cheapest tours in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is often used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of much poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
This was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which ran on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, being more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each with a different animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are management fees and entrance fees.
You may also want to buy a Wild Card, which gives you free entry to either selected national parks or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists as the main destination of their visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph revealed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You will get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and go to Kowloon beach on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on ramparts along the northern coastline.
This was the place that the British colonizers claimed, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest wetland area in the world, stretching 80 km inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the part of the forest that lies in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps, they encompass some of the last remaining populations of the enormous jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 white-tailed deer.
Buses depart from the bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As these buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and solid.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres tall, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two arches that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checks are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the principal inhabitants of what is now eastern Paraguay, where they were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards started the colonization period which lasted for three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its distinct identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at the Las Cañitas polo grounds in December.
At other times of the year, smaller-scale tournaments and matches are held.
Contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo to learn more about tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) with a fixed exchange rate with the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are commonly accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropics, and temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F) are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons; there is about equal rainfall throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park service recommends that you stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how fearsome they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and most large animals will attack.
Every year many visitors get injured because they haven't kept a good enough distance, these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a peculiar situation arose when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, with the exception of a British warship, and almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of its leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As a result of Auckland being sandwiched between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
North Coast beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming conditions, and most also have shade from the Pohutukawa tree.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but good and refreshing.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably a better choice.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you want to be on the safe side.
A small black coffee is espresso, a cappuccino is served with lots of cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is typically of Belgian quality, while the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and damage to the reef is rare.
It is however advisable to follow the advice of the authorities and follow all signs and warnings.
They can be found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the small town of 1770, and occasionally at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active marine mammals; their primary habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be sure of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or enquiries should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the attendees choose to camp at the festival, and most of the attendees believe this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, get there early to get tent space near the music.
Please note that although the music on the main stage has ended, there may be other venues during the festival where music will be played late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with small children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the lugar, as some people will hear it particularly well when the vessel passes through the ice.
A cruise to St. Petersburg allows you to spend some time in the city; cruise passengers are not required to obtain a visa (check terms and conditions).
Casinos make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible there; windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find your way out.
There are often special prices on food, drink and entertainment to keep their spirits up.
In some places free drinks are served, but intoxication is known to impair judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive on higher latitudes or over mountain passes must know that snow, ice or cold temperatures may be encountered.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, there can be so much snow in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be impaired by snow falling or blowing on the windshield, or when there is dew or ice on the windshield.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to travel on land to view the amazing African wildlife, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk close to the vehicles, and standard equipment will provide good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes a little bit shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A bush safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or walking tour) is a walking tour that lasts for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, things can get tricky.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2500 JPY and 130 000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7000 JPY.
Many hotels will lend you an iron and an ironing board, although this is not always available in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause the fabric to shrink or, in the worst case, swell).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it will boil for one minute, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely confident, consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases per se, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by power, do not normally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shops are retail outlets whose goods are exempt from the payment of certain local or national taxes and duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one must often drive through desolate forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you must keep a cool head when encountering the steep grades, narrow lanes and sharp turns typical of this stretch.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than earlier and later road sections, usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph), and it is even more important to follow them.
Oddly enough, mobile coverage is much better here than many other stretches along the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, just like their southern neighbour Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common, with apples being added year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a small but mighty pastry, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on your region.
Curries are based on herbs and spices that are mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curries, while in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, it usually refers to the cuisine of central and eastern Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, the most dominant flavours preferred by Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups support the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety hazard, as the feet can become trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he may be pulled after the horse runs off guard.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Some ballrooms, especially English ballrooms, also have a safety mechanism that allows a step stool to be released from the ballroom if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as Yosemite in South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a fantastic view, and climbers from much of the world are continually carving new routes into the walls, offering endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports involving sliding down a snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major recreational activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skiboms", planning their entire vacation around the act of skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, with cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5000 BC.
Slalom as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This is also called wilderness skiing, cross-country skiing, or mountain skiing.
The activity is related to, but normally does not involve, high-mountain skiing or mountaineering in steep terrain, which requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski run you're about to take as a long walk.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover greater distances than walking, but only very rarely is it as fast as cross-country skiing in groomed trails without a heavy bag on your back.
Europe is a relatively small continent with a large number of sovereign states.
But the Schengen area acts almost like one country in this context.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport controls.
If you have a Schengen visa, it works the same way - you don't need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique; some tax authorities define items more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, and the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
One can define household goods as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding it is also important for many other professions.

Today, tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, or Sameland.
Although widely used, especially by non-Roma, the term "Gypsies" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If travel advice has been issued for the country you are visiting, this may affect your health insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may also want to check what advice is available from authorities other than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often summary, general and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for all hazardous weather phenomena that may cause damage, serious social consequences or loss of human life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and fires are all forms and effects of extreme weather, as are tornadoes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include heavy snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers should also be aware of the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that might be considered a war zone should get professional training.
With a search on the Internet for "hostile environment course" or "conflict management course" you will probably find the address of a local company.
A course normally covers the situations discussed, in more detail, and usually includes practical exercises.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are several books and magazines on how to survive in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their home country.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports without an X or updated documents to match a person's desired name and gender varies.
In addition, the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies.
Security searches have also become far more intrusive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Before the surgery, trans people probably can't expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outgoing currents are ocean currents with waves that have breached the shore and retreated, often to reefs.
Due to the submarine topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, where it can flow rapidly outward to deeper waters.
Most die from exhaustion while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the flow, it's no harder to swim back than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught by the current again; alternatively, depending on your strengths and whether you've been spotted, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock can be faster than culture shock (fewer days of wheat bread), last longer, and be more severe.
Those who have been abroad and found it easy to adapt to the new culture may find it harder to re-adjust to their own culture.
When they return home after living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of their old habits.
When travelling abroad, people were probably tolerant and accommodating at first, as it takes some time for visitors to adjust to a new country.
Everyone may not be as patient and accommodating when the travelers return home, but this is so important, I guess.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in stillness before the show starts.
Usually, you hear the sound of tourists and vendors, and the story of the sound and the light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most number of stations, of which sixteen were active in 2020.
The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long chain in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, separated by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, the Sentinel Range, contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, whose peak rises to 4,892 m (16,000 ft).
In remote areas where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a good substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is commonly used within shipping, including recreational vessels, and during expeditions requiring remote data and voice services.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school leavers who have completed a course of study and can take a gap year before entering university, without affecting their education.
In many cases, a course abroad in your gap year can improve your chances of getting a higher education in your home country.
Usually, one must pay a tuition fee to enroll in this type of program.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the island groups and the lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are certainly big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. the Netherlands has a ratio of one to forty).
Most regular cruises in the Baltics have a longer stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two whole days, but that you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore when you are participating in organized excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be scary for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of, and it's not that different from fear and aversion to other things, which very many people have.
For some, learning more about how airplanes work, and what happens during a flight, can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or not having control.
Time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes the major airlines had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If shipped by air freight, some routes could take several days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only thing that worked to speed things up was to send them as checked baggage, as the airline's regulations did not allow for checked baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
Just cough up a bunch of seats (or ideally have your airline do it for you) if you want to fly first class or business class.
This is not cheap, and as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the standard economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class.
There is generally no point in looking for cheap business or first class tickets on direct routes from A to B by plane.
Airlines know that there is a certain group of air passengers who are willing to pay very high prices to go anywhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic with many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, which is not recognised by any UN member states.
Economic cooperation has been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest seaport after Istanbul and a major transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center that encircles a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers feature traditional red roof tiles, a 17th-century square, and old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more influenced by Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.

This place deserves to be shown dignity, reverence and respect.
Do not destroy the site by drawing or writing on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan only, as it is by law the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other services.
Regular metro announcements are only made in Catalan, while unscheduled stops are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, brash and arrogant.
Although this is often a mistaken stereotype, the best way to get around Paris is to behave in the best possible way, as a "bien élevé" (well-behaved).
A seemingly brusque exterior disappears quickly among Parisians if you are at all polite.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, fir and birch trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly wide variety of plant communities due to the spectrum of microclimates, varying soils and varying elevations.
The area also has an extremely high diversity of animal and bird species.
It is home to rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and tiger, along with many more common species.
Women visiting the monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend out shawls to women who have not thought of this, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing them.
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, uses a lot of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli, which is bread with olive oil, tomato and available flavourings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns besides the word Sie (You) always start with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
In this way, individual verbs and objects are more easily distinguished.
It also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated because one must determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to follow are c and g, as pronunciation varies based on the following vowel.
Care must also be taken to pronounce r and rr differently: Caro means dear, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how to understand sentences better.
If you know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will naturally be easier for you.
However, it is easy for those who know some Spanish to quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be memorized.
Observatories built before modern times are largely obsolete today and survive as museums or educational buildings.
Since light pollution was not a problem at the time, they are usually found in cities or university campuses where they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Today's modern research telescopes are often enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossoms, known as hanami, have been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were arranged by the emperor and were for him and other members of the imperial court aristocracy only.

You can for example visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also a starting point for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have adopted many of its traditions.
It is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night and watch the sunrise outdoors.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well be a spring and fertility rite rooted in pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold the Easter Vigil on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where the congregation often breaks into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that came to the islands originally, came swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans, more mammals have arrived, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you get to experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
At this time there are good conditions for viewing the northern lights, since the sky is dark for most of the day.
As the population is spread out over the areas and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to look at the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Dress is standard business attire, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is paramount, and emphasis is placed on group effort rather than individual accomplishment.
Employees must often obtain approval from their superiors for all decisions to be made, and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without question.
