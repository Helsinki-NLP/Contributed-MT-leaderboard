The United States Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making meaningful changes within our organization rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of proportion so bravely described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone undetected for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brown above and pale or carotenoid below.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed shaft, called a spine, but do have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - researchers have concluded that the spine probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists point out that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals the plumage of an adult, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
For magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

Infrared images reveal that these are probably caves, based on the temperature variations between day and night.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night".
"Their thermal behaviour is not as stable as that of the large caves on the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth", according to Glen Cushing, a USGS crew member and staff member at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each step of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder by Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in police custody pending her indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised as her picture has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be treading a dangerous line if they publish photographs, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the overall prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until charges are laid.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other issues discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only five years.
The shooters in the additional parasite control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four designated shooters for the first round of culling were properly trained and instructed in safety procedures.
Martelly yesterday inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to set the country on the path to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were scheduled to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage had been reported in that country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician, and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... I love her and will miss her... hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes, 29 percent thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as these were forbidden within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "gossip and political nonsense".
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the migratory cone-billed finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways.
It can be drawn into fine thread, which can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and sends it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, but the greatest benefit it has brought us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging house cats) that eat much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task assigned to each cat, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
Packs consist of one to three adult male lions, as well as about 30 females and cubs.
The women are usually very close to each other, their family being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (sometimes with difficulty), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only big cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and growls.
Ocelots eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find food animals (prey) by scent, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its day, afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an extra set of teeth in the roof of the mouth, so that anything in its path could not escape.
We can't be sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate foods familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the dormouse, a kind of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they lay on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
For each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple that was viewed as the god's dwelling place.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Much of a Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street; the houses were built of stone.
Since there were few forests in the land of Canaan, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, it's said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder because he found Greenland -- and named it -- while traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (about 29 3/4 inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil, and is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a sense, the size of the society to which it refers.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations.A civilisational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognised as genuine civilisations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all of its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The earliest records of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings surrounding the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It's still made today, but what's important is that its image format is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and this is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So we say that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that provides dynamism while protecting the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was challenged.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion bound the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power touched everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire sea areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral shipping.
Since this tactic elicited only a lukewarm response, Germany expected a similar response to her unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying in the struggle to sit on the throne of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
So, after the Revolution, the trades were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual leanings.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it's there.
From above, one can see nothing but the clear, magnificent sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, one can see or hear only a small part of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Top means you have to start from the tip and push the bow, and bottom means you have to start from the rise (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow upward usually produces a softer sound, while a bow downward is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to make your own marks in pencil, but remember that printed bow marks are for musical purposes and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were obliged, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a slain royal guard at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you have to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally regarded as the Early Middle Ages - a period of European history running from the 11th to the 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: that technological development itself occurs through a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and that technology affects societies in ways that are intrinsically rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat personal injuries.
Romanticism featured an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
The theories of Romanticism held that geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geography would emerge, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of the slowness of communication, Western fashions could be 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using preserved seeds originating in the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some feral children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability the child suffered.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others may have been raised by animals; some may have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a way of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new curriculum or starting a new project.
The supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, nurturing and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are seen as major factors in promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'ongoing relationships' were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
For example, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause the variations between the two basins to alternate with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to respond has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digested and provides a large amount of protein with all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of being intentionally awakened during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you're sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking lots of fluids before sleeping (especially water or tea, which are known diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace is not the same as the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present, and each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. It is through the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakened consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods, and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see actual fighting, through proxy armies, on battlefields as far away as Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish nonaggression pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the United States tried to get soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to stop the smuggling.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar term of shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Crossmembers were introduced early enough to hold the tracks in place; however, it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more effective if fitted with an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as they usually do.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment, but if we do not want only a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of mankind's overpopulation and extravagant life-style.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive.
Few people think of them as dinosaurs since they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are still dinosaur-like.
They have scaly, clawed feet, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible; symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Probably the best indication of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Redworms, like bedbugs, are nest-dwelling, meaning that they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their best interests, nor in the best interests of the child, to become involved in the raising of a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but which also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, became accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a running cycle for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, how much of the genetic material is affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is the practice of visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the flora and fauna.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning people leave the small country towns by car on their way to work and meet other people who are going to work in the country they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its stable state that supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about poor water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to do so made it easier for them to evade predators and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km in width.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent state and the least densely populated.
Vatican City writes its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they occur in nature in crude form and are fairly simple to mine with primitive tools.
Greek philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that the latter change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and then of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, the advent of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and less frequent use.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when the next new thing arrives.
The fission bomb works on the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Sort of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and its outermost layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It's thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what causes some people to want the things they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organisation want to impose on itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injuries, tumours and trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Artificial intelligence research is concerned with the automation by machines of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been depicted in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school classroom, and often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips, where students can look at old objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often experiment with blogging with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog started working on improving her writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them".The need to arouse public interest motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used well, blogs ""can allow students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions with others and express their own views on specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002)".
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessential Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that may surprise many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa lie in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent on its own, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too valuable.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviour that they consider to be harassment, such as being followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm in refusing male advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, one can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and trinkets of all kinds, but that is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma needs to be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about R500 for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" show on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2. It is divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It can be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to some South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main attraction for many tourists.
The skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on landfills on the north shore.
This is the place that the British colonists settled, so it seems to me to be a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by wetlands.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966. You can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer here.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese cabotage boats, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes inhabiting the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish ushered in a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is widely accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On nearby islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland money outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and summer temperatures exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold. Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than the thermometer says.
There are no real "wet" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep enough distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
The paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful rally held in the town during the Mau movement's struggle for independence.
There are many beaches, as Auckland straddles two harbours, and the most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes popular with families, have numerous shops along the shoreline and are safe for swimming.
The main local beer is "Number One", a fairly ordinary, but tasty and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines to taste, but perhaps New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
A short black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stay away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp on-site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to get up close and personal with the musical event, you're going to have to get there early to find a good campsite.
Keep in mind that even if the musical performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue late into the night at other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as ice crossing can cause unbearable noise in the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by patrons; they rarely have windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to locate.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them there.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone traveling by car to high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block your way.
Visibility may also be reduced by snowfall or dust, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term "safari" refers to an excursion into the African countryside, particularly the savannah, for the purpose of viewing the spectacle of wild animals in their natural habitat.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as bushwalking, walking safari or footing) involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were originally scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be borrowed, even if the rooms do not have one.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid allowing the fabric to overheat (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities it is sufficient to boil water for one minute; in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in more serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes save considerably, especially on such items as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind. Steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and following sections - generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are a common sight: apples are baked and baked all year round, while cherries and plums are popular in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Since Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further qualifier, it tends to refer to foods originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese favor being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are footrests for the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the user, but they can pose a safety problem: the user's feet can become trapped.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a flat, rather narrow heel and sole.
Second, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a rider to fall off the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - The destination of excellence for rock climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large walls and granite cliffs.
Mountaineers around the world are constantly discovering new routes up the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan their entire holiday around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old - some rock paintings of skiers date back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first recreational skiing club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
It is similar to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are performed on rough terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than on foot - but you will rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries, so in normal circumstances travelling through several countries means having to apply for several visas and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define goods more than 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary from place to place; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Craft products can be considered antiques, even if they are not as old as similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although very widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term 'Gypsy' is often considered pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is the subject of a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also use advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and over-simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of many kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric features.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include cold snaps, snowstorms with high winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risk of bad weather in their destination region, as this may affect their planned itineraries.
Anyone planning to go to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Courses" will likely provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or equivalent.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether or not you have been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Reintegration shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adjusting to a new culture may find it very difficult to adjust back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your native habits.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the region's most interesting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you can still hear the noise of tourists and vendors, and the story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains melt into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 225-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4,892 m.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone service, you may have no choice but to use a satellite phone.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, since you have to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and telephony transmission needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about how to connect to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken a gap year abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your home country.
As a rule, you have to pay a registration fee for these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for boating.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and on lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for a few full days and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea at all and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
This is nothing to be ashamed of. It is no different from the personal fears and apprehensions that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well rewarded for delivering quickly, and in many cases the timing of an urgent repair is crucial to the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
On some routes the big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes, it would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap. As a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is not necessary to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passenger who is willing to pay a high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a thriving, modern commercial center on a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs from the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves.
A half-hour stroll through this fascinating village is well worth the effort.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra in the north is easily accessible and was made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's glowing description of its splendor.
Bus 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
As you travel north, be sure to visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for Marian apparitions.
Remember, you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site of almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their time here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, to act like a well-mannered person.
The abrupt exterior of Parisians evaporates quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a great variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the great spotted owl can be seen here, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive empty-handed, but if you bring your own and wear a brightly colored one, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
Likewise, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
This garment can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, followed by the word Sie which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It's a great way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
Please also make sure that you pronounce "r" and "rr" distinctly: "caro" means "dear", while "carro" means "wagon".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak some Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their day was not as much of a concern as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures placed in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the close aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best in a natural setting, so resist the temptation to remove even "one".
If you visit a strictly managed garden, taking "specimens" will also get you kicked out without discussion.
Singapore is generally regarded as an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost anything you need once you arrive.
But, being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to heat (always) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are considering goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christendom's most important holidays, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It's traditional to stay awake on Easter night in an open area to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well have been a pre-Christian springtime fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking into the celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that came to these islands did so originally by water, by swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals have not been able to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good time to see the northern lights, as the sky will be dark most of the day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners may be accustomed.
Suits are standard work attire, and employees are addressed by their surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
